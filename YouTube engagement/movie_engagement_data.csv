'71,&#39;71 Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Jack O&#39;Connell War Movie HD,J-BaKfl1Ms4,1808230,5232,538,"Jack o' Connell is quickly becoming that actor that when I see his name in a film I'm immediately interested. He's such an intense actor. I see him reaching the heights Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy one day, if not surpassing them.|, I loved this movie when I first saw it a few years ago. I thought it was one of the better movies I’ve ever seen. I just recently returned from visiting Ireland and Northern Ireland for the first time. We spent a couple of days each in Derry and Belfast. I have never had such an indescribable feeling in my life as I did at the Peace Wall in Belfast. I can assure you it wasn’t a feeling of serenity.|, As a foreigner who's rather unfamiliar with the history, this film just makes me feel the way most war theme films do: there's no winner in such conflicts. Instead of focusing on obvious cheering for hero or blaming on certain evil, making sure not to repeat too much of the sad past is more important in my opinion.|, This movie is an intense take on a soldier who gets caught in a conflict which he doesn't have any stake in other than staying alive.  Some great performances in this powerful film.  Certainly O'Connell does a stellar job, but to me Sean Harris steals the show.|, A powerful film. Yann Demange' directing is immaculate and Jack O'Connell is a class act.|, I'm so proud of Jack O'Connell :') he has come along way since Skins 👏👏👏|, It was such an amazing movie and beautiful surprise! It sheds a lot of light on a struggle that many Americans are uninformed about or completely oblivious to.|, Watched this last night, completely overlooked film, Jack o'connell's acting was incredible.|, The fact he did this at 24 and unbroken at 23, both amazing performances 👏🏾|, I am from Northern Ireland, and this is the realest depiction I have seen of that time, even the slang and insults are the kind used here. It was hard to watch, and it totally brought me back to that awful time in our history, but well worth the watch, and well made."
10 Cloverfield Lane,"10 Cloverfield Lane Official Trailer #1 (2016) -  Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman Movie HD",saHzng8fxLs,11549803,44246,6538,"Just saw this gem. You gotta love John Goodman, especially if you're a 90s kid.|, Honestly, I think this is one of my favourite trailers of all time. The music and the change in theme just fits so perfectly. Also, it somehow tells you a lot even though it gives you very little. I remember seeing people theorizing about what was going on when the trailer first came out and some people were actually pretty spot on.|, Am I the only person that loved the ending? It wasn't ""out of place"" (as so many have said) but it really turned the tables from the typical happy endings movies always get.|, I really love this trailer. It got me so hyped for a psychological thrower, and it barely spoiled any of the plot or the twists. It's a shame the ending sort of dragged, but this trailer is a perfect example of how you build intrigue without showing the whole movie.|, Not only was this film extremely intense, but it added a bit of psychological thriller in there. And I loved it.|, This movie is an absolute gem when you're both a victim of domestic abuse and at the same time love horror.|, I love how it implies two very different tones. Either John Goodman is trying desperately to help them or they're trying desperately to get away from him.|, I LOVE this movie. I can't even BEGIN to describe how much I love this movie! I don't care if people didn't like the ending, I loved it from beginning to end without thinking anything else in the theater, other than trying to solve the mysteries of 10 Cloverfield Lane. I love it.|, This is the first movie I've watched in ages where there was no guessing what was going to happen next. It twists and turns like a sneaky motherfucker. Excellent movie!|, This could honestly be the best trailer ever.

It takes you on such a small, powerful, self-contained journey that makes you want to see the movie without spoiling the whole thing."

I really hope he gets other acting gigs, for a moment there i thought this was a sequel or a prequel to No One Lives. it doesn't appear to be. but damn... he just has that intensity. i doubt it'll be as good as that one was, but i'll check it out none the less!|, Now that we know the ending it makes not seeing this much easier.|, The fights in this movie were hilarious.|, فيلم اثارة وغموض رائع وجميل

مع كل الشكر والتقدير : للمترجم|, Great 🎥 great actors great story! A lot of suspans,it's kind of the movies u just dont wanna finish|, Beyond showing off the entire movie right away, the kidnapper goes ""I've been following you, I know everything about you"" one minute, to ""you should go to the police"" the next."" I don’t know what the context is, but as a kidnapper, if you're suddenly afraid of the law and the person you kidnapped, shouldn't you just kill them? Like, you already broke the law, and now you have a psycho in a concrete chamber in YOUR house?|, Topher Grace would have been a better and believable casting.|, 这部小作品很有意思，前半截对女主角的正面刻画很好。女主也是很好看，beauty.有意思的是，导演是女性。我喜欢这个导演|, I have just seen the entire plot for the movie, why would i watch this? Trailers these days are basically a 2 minute version of a movie, instead of a sneak peek leaving out the best parts|, This was a really good movie.."
12 Strong,12 STRONG - Official Trailer,-Denciie5oA,18053617,120913,6949,"The movie could have ended earlier if he brought his Hammer to fight|, Truly one of the most stunning military accomplishments in history. The actions of ODA 595 and Dostum’s fighters deserve to be in the history books and into legend. When only 12 American SF operators and roughly 200 Northern Alliance fighters took on nearly 15,000 Taliban fighters on an offensive campaign to take out one of the major Taliban strongholds in Northern Afghanistan. 

These men, outnumbered and outgunned, took on numerical superior Taliban that were armed with artillery and tanks with only horses and limited air support. Truly one of the most underrated  and extraordinary accomplishment in modern warfare.|, Can't wait to see this. Its about time the Horse Soldiers story was told! What that ODA did was nothing short of amazing. It does look a bit hollywood but I hope the movie itself is a little more grounded! I got to hold some of the props recently and the gear IS ACCURATE as hell to the time period. Funny how this is now considered a period piece because we've been at war so long. We don't even use half of that gear anymore. SPEAR vests! so dope!|, Just remember this was a true story that all 12 made it back.Thirteen U.S. service members tragically lost their lives to a suicide bomber in the rushed and chaotic evacuation in 2021. Thank you to all of our brave men and woman who faught in Afghanistan. Vote.|, The horse jumping back up at the end of the trailer and in the movie gives me chills every time!|, I remember reading Horse Soldiers as a kid with immense admiration. now I see my brother performing it well; it's just icing on the cake 🤣😆😄😄😄|, After seeing it I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised how well done this film is in the sea of familiar generic our balls are made of steel movies.
Don't get me wrong there are issues and some cliched stuff, but I thought they tried to avoid regular tropes by focusing more on the characters and their interaction with the natives plus trying to understand the culture and the rules of civilization rather than bringing up patriotism every once a while. There are some really well choreographed action pieces, acting is fine and the script is not annoying as it could be, but it is overlong, repetitive and over the top so that might bother some people. Overall 3/5.|, This looks fantastic. I remember hearing about them riding horses to battle, that’s bad ass. I’m pretty sure one of the green berets breaks his back but continues in the fight.|, ""The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday""...
Honoring all our fallen soldiers, and remembering Operation Red Wings 6/28/05 gone but not forgotten. 
Semper Fi 🇺🇲|, I enjoy military movies based on a true story. This is in my archives alongside Lone survivor, Unbroken, American Sniper, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. Others you would enjoy equally are: Shooter, Close, Tears of Sun and Triple Frontier."
12 Years a Slave,12 YEARS A SLAVE - Official Trailer (HD),z02Ie8wKKRg,8396503,39660,4485,"This movie was one of the most moving, emotional films I have ever seen. It's been years since I last watched it and this trailer still gives me chills. 
It breaks my heart to know how cruel people can be. To keep other humans as your property, because of the colour of their skin. The worst part; slavery still exists in some parts of the world.|, ""I don't want to survive, I want to live"" That part always gets me.|, The acting in this film is insanely good.|, It's amazing that Solomon's story is being heard 165 years later. This movie had me in tears. I'm so heartbroken for what black people had to go through and so sorry for the horrible treatment they had to endure. I pray for the healing of those that are affected by the history and the way black people were treated. Much love and respect goes out to the beautiful black race.|, i still get goosebumps when i watch this movie, its incredible|, First heard about this movie in 2014, a lot of people were talking about it and I heard about how good it was and how tragic it was, and I tend to care about social issues so I wanted to watch it. This movie is heart breaking, and I absolutely love how it doesn't romanticize any of the abuse that was suffered in it.|, A lot of people really don't understand how bad American slavery was. This wasn't regular old world slavery, this was chattel slavery, you were born a slave, you died a slave, your children died slaves, and your children's children died slaves. You could never hope to be anything but a slave. We have never come to terms with our demons as a country. Slavery lasted 245 years officially, and after all was said and done, slaves and children of slaves never got any kind of mental help (and go figure, mental health became a huge taboo in the AA community), no official apology, and not even a single day of recognition for their suffering. It was like America just wanted to make it all go away as a country, ignore it, change the subject, and now we are paying the price of our actions. |, I was glad to see that this movie won an Oscar for best picture. It's very powerful and important for everyone to see. It sucks how most people don't understand anything about slavery like it's a no big deal. I think everyone needs to see it, so they'll know how brutal and severe slavery was. Who knows. Maybe racism will die down. Overall, perfect movie.|, Just the trailer had me in tears because of the vicious cruelty but also because of Northup indomitable spirit.  There is joy for his escape, but magnifies the horror of the other slaves left behind.|, One of the most heart-wrenching films ever! It was definitely difficult for me to watch, but it’s worth it. I absolutely love history! The acting was insanely beautiful!"
13 Sins,13 Sins Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Mark Webber Horror Thriller Movie HD,vTNtyJIKTXk,1399792,2947,262,"i loved this movie. it's like a morbid social experiment. though i think there was room for much more development. i feel like keeping the reveals a mystery was a safe move, but if they could pull it off it would blow minds into a new dimension.|, Mark Webber is a good actor !❤️
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE|, I watched this on FOX Action. I was walking through my dad's room and this started to play, I literally made my way onto his bed and watched the entire movie. It was so good! I love it!|, This was such an awesome movie. I'm so glad I saw it. Go watch it yourself, don't read the critic's reviews. It really is that good.|, 5 stars, great CRAZY and original plot, perfect acting.|, I watched this last night.  Great movie but really hard to watch at times, just because of the sheer horror you know is about to happen to him.|, Saw this on Netflix--we really liked it. It was pretty imaginative, had some humor, suspenseful.|, Great movie I really recommend it! Ignore all those dislikes, they came from people who just criticize everything.|, Saw this on 'Horror' a month or so back - was pleasantly impressed with it considering the usual array of cliched and negative critical reviews. Well worth a watch!! 😉 🤓|, bad ass movie. thriller and horror
would def recommend it to anyone looking for something new"
1917,1917 | The Battlefield Run in 4K HDR,WYCo-3pw52o,2619948,43798,2368,"what I really love about this scene is when he is running down no-man's-land, the camera doesn't follow Schofield. It feels like Schofield is chasing after the camera losing and gaining ground. The cinematography in this movie is outstanding!|, I'm no film expert, but this has got to be one of the all time greatest shots in cinematic history.|, 6:50 the way he freezes and feels all of his ego go down the drain in an instant once he hears ""the germans planned for this"" was amazing.  thats phenomenal acting.  you can feel his emotion without seeing his face or any spoken dialogue.|, When I found out him falling down while running wasn’t scripted, but they still kept it in, 10/10|, I think that the guy falling and not getting up could also be realistic. These guys are basically marching to their deaths so if I even remotely felt an impact in that kind of panicked situation I might stay down.|, His only “rest” during the entire journey was when he went unconscious, ran for his life to avoid enemy fire, jumped into a river without knowing the consequences and ran into a open battlefield to complete the mission. A true soldier that stood to finish the fight no matter what happens. Epic movie.|, Love how they put lesser known celebrities as the main characters while the most known celebrities are just side characters that only appears in short amount of time to surprise the audience.|, It's absolutely insane that people did that run in real life, made it to the other side, and fought tooth and nail to the bitter end. Each wave attack usually only lasted about 10 minutes before the wave was either destroyed or the trench was captured.|, Love the subtle start of the soundtrack when the soldier says ""We're the Devons."" It's really brilliant and it almost symbolizes the sudden gain of hope in Schofield as he really thought he had failed to save the lives of 1600 men only to find those men still alive.|, Just couldn't imagine going out into a open field running towards the enemy while bombs are falling all around you it just show how much bravery those soldiers had"

Action, Comedy and a teaspoon of romance and two badass actors. THUMPS UP|, This was a great one right here! Denzel and Whalberg together was simply magic. This is the true modern Lethal Weapon on the real.|, When is the sequel coming!?!?
If there was ever a movie that deserves a sequel it is this one.|, This movie was very entertaining! Two great actors with great chemistry.

2000 Mules,Barr Laughs Off Election Fraud Allegations In ‘2000 Mules’ Documentary,Nz6smxo-MkE,168755,1223,2427,"Remind me never to have William Barr argue on my behalf.|, The part in 2000 mules where Dinesh says it’s morbin time gave me the chills.|, I love how people only talk about the geotracking data and don’t mention the geotracking data paired with the raw CCTV VIDEOS he also showed in the film of the same people depositing loads of ballots into the boxes. Nobody ever mentions that part of it, the videos align perfectly with the geotracking pings. This film was spot on and to say what we witnessed in that film is nothing of concern is just a flat out lie.|, [Evidence of government corruption gets released]
Government: ""nuh-uh""
The people: ""Maybe we should at least look into it ourselves instead of taking the government's word on it.""
Government: ""The people are a threat to our democracy!""|, For Bill Barr, thousands of random people going around cities like Atlanta & Phoenix makes geotracking the mules utterly impossible.  By this logic, thousands of people going around Washington DC on Jan 6th would make geotracking the Capitol protestors also impossible.|, Man, you just can’t trust anyone these days.|, It is scary to know how deep are these people connected to each other, only God can bring all these people down.|, For the average tax paying American I am blown away by how so many in the political class dismiss this film and fail to give any accurate reason why. The film  provides new evidence that if true is a smoking gun.|, The mules did not just pass by the boxes as a statistical norm as Barr suggest. The criminal mules followed complicated paths deliberately and with speed. Why does Barr regard intelligent people and the truth with such contempt ?|, What happened to Barr? Did someone find his name on Jeffrey Epstein's client list? For some odd reason he did a 180 on Trump."
20th Century Women,20th Century Women | Official Trailer HD | A24,6JnFaltqnAY,990175,8507,520,"I heard about this film on NPR and I can tell all of you guys/gals out there that this is not a man hating feminist film. It's literally about the directors life and how his mother and the other woman in his life helped him become the man he is today.|, This story got under my skin in the best of ways.  All the players are incredible; a true ensemble cast with amazingly nuanced performances.  And perhaps the best use of music in a film I have seen in a long time. Some truly funny and poignant lines that I had to stop the film so I could jot down. Just lovely writing.|, This movie is probably about women apreciation, feminism and how women helps men in their daily life and I love it! Probably one of my favorite films from this year, from the music to the cinematography, to the script and the quotes just, outstanding!|, Boy, Annette Bening just gets better and better. No matter how hard she trys to make herself look ""unattractive"" for a part, her natural beauty still shines through. I cannot wait to see this.|, This movie isnt even about feminism. Its just about a second hand family in the 70's its just about connecting to the characters. The plot is obscure and hidden and its what makes this movie great. Theres only like 20 minutes in this movie thats about feminism. Its a simply elegant movie and better then the super hero movies that are pumped out 24/7|, This is one of the best movies that I have seen. I loved the way how the mother sees things and I loved the way how each character is portrayed.  If you are looking for a movie with a vibe and something to think of, this is the one.|, ""Whatever you think your life is going to be like, just know it's not going to be anything like that"" Greta Gerwig
That hit me like a brick.|, I LOVED this movie! the cinematography, acting, music  characters, everything was just... beautiful.|, This movie was wonderful, such a blissful movie that invites important self reflection. I had the privilege to see it on an enormous screen and I look forward to watching it again on smaller ones.|, 7 years late. But never too late for brilliance. Thank You to the entire team for this one. Thanks A24. You bring movies I don't want to forget."

Edit- the news bout Chadwick really hit deep man. he was a great actor and an even better person, may his soul rest in peace 🙏🏾💯|, Mr. Boseman was already battling cancer, probably knew it was not a good prognosis either. He did a phenomenal job in this movie AND he fought to make sure that Sienna Miller, his costar, got the same compensation for the movie as he did. He even went so far as to take a reduction in his pay to make that happen.  Men like Mr. Boseman, REAL MEN are desperately needed in THIS world; and yet, for some reason, they seem to be the ones who leave here early!|, Everyone should go see this movie ASAP!!!

That line was deep 💯|, Amazing movie. I haven't watched typical cop movies in a while and while the plot is very typical of the genre, I think the gunfights are the best part of this movie. Felt like Chadwick is a samurai fighting hordes of enemies, only difference is he's holding a gun.|, Stop every train, loop the subways, flood the island with blue, AND GET THIS MAN A SHIELD|, I'd say Chadwick Boseman has the tools and the acting chops that can emulate Denzel Washington's career if he keeps this up.|, A man with talent and passion has left us,but his story in film's  is still with us."

He lost a lot of weight. RIP, Sid. You were one of a kind.|, Sid was an amazing actor. I’m thankful Rob kept him acting.|, I can understand why seeing him like this is upsetting.. but think why it’s upsetting, it’s because the dude has a larger than life personality, and it’s hard to see him a frail old man. But Sid is a true actor. And this scene was obviously made for him to go out as a bad ass, cussing and dying for the man..

Instead of Themistocles this dude should've been named TheTesticles|, Fun fact: in the actual battle despite being outnumbered 3 - 1, the Athenians altered their battle formations but removing the support in the middle to stretch out the lines, making them equal in length to the vastly more numerous Persian army. They also put all their best soldiers on the flanks, meaning when the Persians focused their strength in the weak middle, the Athenians cut down the flanks and managed to encircle on 3 sides an enemy that nearly tripled theirs in number|, ""He gives the Persian a taste of Athenian shock combat"" gave me the biggest chills ever.|, Look at this. No smartphones, no tablets .
Just people living in the moment.|, Okay, I'm not saying it's accurate, or portrays the complex political struggles and conflicts of the time.... but that music and artistic style is pretty epic|, I don't know why but Themistocles' entrance gives me chills. Him running to battle with that lightning behind him it's just epic.|, AS A GREEK, i can assure you beyond any doubt that in the good ol' times, we all fought in the nude, we were all ripped like statures, we were tall and exceptionally handsome, and all our enemies fell before us, without ANY resistance, so spectacularly, as if they had never held any weapons in their entire lives, no matter of how experienced they were. And we could snipe Dariuses from a great distance. We had killed many of them, in fact.|, People need to understand that the 300 films are based off comics, not exact historical accuracy. The film makers wanted to depict 300 like a Greek legend ( which idolized physical fitness ) so that’s why you see all these body builder looking Greek warriors. I think they did a fantastic job with the films. A 100% historically accurate film would be a little boring in my opinion.|, This is still the most epic movie opening I have ever seen in theaters.|, ""Video games is the cause of violence""

He died the same day as jackie broke the color barrier with dodgers. He truly portrayed him so well, and become a good actor. RIP.|, Rip Chadwick. Can’t believe he died on Jackie Robinson day. What an incredible human being!|, I like how his teammate defended him. That shows respects.|, According to Jonathan Eig's book ""Opening Day"", the confrontation between Eddie Stanky and the Phillies was way more dramatic.  After hearing the racist taunts being hurled At Jackie Robinson [which were coming from Phillie players as well], Stanky picked up a bat, walked over to the Phillie dugout and threatened to bash some heads in if he heard any more racist taunting aimed at Robinson.  To emphasize his point, Stanky threw the bat into the dugout, which caused a whole bunch of Phillie ballplayers and coaches to duck for cover!|, Bullying someone who can’t fight back is being a coward imo.|, *That man who stood up for Robinson is amazing.*|, My stepdad was an extra in this movie when they filmed it here in Georgia. He passed away two weeks ago to this day, and I so happen to see this today. Glad he got to do what he loved before he left us. Film was his whole life and seeing this video at this moment made me a little emotional.|, As a Phillies fan its embarrassing to know we had this man as our manager at one point|, I’m glad there were people that weren’t racist back then"

In my opinion; it's one of the best shark movies. You feel like you're the characters and it leaves you on edge the entire time and that plot twist ending completely caught me over guard! Movies never really actually surprise me when there's a plot twist, but this one sure did and it was such a good dark ending too. I hated that Kate died, but honestly.. if she had been patient and careful, she would have also made it. But just like with every movie, there are flaws. I love how realistic is it up until it's not. Like how their ears should have popped or how the sharks conveniently left at the end or even how much air they had, it just wasn't accurate. But I still love this movie a lot and I would personally rate it a 4 out 5 stars.|, This movie is grossly underrated. It had me stressed out the whole time.|, Claire, you're a mermaid and an original vampire, you'll be fine.|, This movie stuck with me for a whole year. The end made me cry like crazy, just thinking about going through this with my sister really hit too close to home for me. Horror movies are my favorite genre but damn the ending really got me|, The scene where she lights the flare while they're swimming up... one of the freaking (and freakiest!) best shots I've seen in a movie.  It seems odd (and scary) when you see it, but makes sense in the long run.  Wish I could find a screen shot of it!|, U know when people in the movie go underwater,I like to hold my breath to see if I will survive in the situation|, I also saw the film when it was released as ""In The Deep"", I personally liked it a lot, as many people pointed out, I thought it was superior to The Shallows. The relationship between the two sisters is interesting, the movie is suspenseful, and I think a lot of people are going to talk about that ending. Very good decision by Dimension to pick up the film from the Weinstein Brothers for a theatrical release. I gave it a 7.5/10.|, Emma could've easily frozen the sharks. (Some people will get this)|, I never watch a movie twice but I broke that rule for this movie. Absolutely love it"

Movies that make you feel trapped in there with the characters. Any underwater or space movie I'm all over also.  I'll check this one out|, Moral of all adventure horror films: Never follow anyone who says, ""like screw this, let's go somewhere no one has never ever been before!"".|, I noticed a lot of foreshadowing in the movie and I really enjoyed it. It was predictable at times (like any other horror movie) but the moments I didnt expect had me jumping and screaming. The music used was amazing and added to the suspense. Blind sharks? Pretty creative in my opinion. I felt like I was with the girls while they were underwater and I felt what they felt - panic, claustrophobic, fear, etc. 9/10 rating🏆|, I saw it yesterday with a bunch of friends at the cinema, and i have to admit that it is horrifying, but mostly because of the sounds, music, and jumpscares. Overall it is a good movie. I liked it a lot|, This movie was actually pretty good way better than the first one and man the ending test my patience and raised my blood pressure so much|, Just watched this movie and I really enjoyed it. So suspenseful, intense & crazy. Lots of jumpscares. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommend it if you enjoy being thrilled 🦈|, “I’m gonna show you a place no tourist would think to look in a million years.”

DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF|, I guess 47 meters down uncaged sounds better than 154.2 feet down uncaged.|, This has no right to look as good as it does. I’m gonna be in the theater as soon as possible to see this. It looks so fun and scary.|, The movie is already 1 year old!
It's pretty much on the same level as the first movie but there's no connection. The sharks are the best part. It does make swimming in an explored part of underwater that much more scary. And the fact these sharks have evolved over time to hunt in the dark with the swimmers being trapped in these tight spaces and getting swooped up by underwater currents."

The action, the drama everything! Good job Keanu! 5 stars for 47 ronin|, Keanu Reeves is always, in a way or another, THE ONE !|, The director said that he wanted to take a true story and give it a fantasy spin and have the best of both worlds.  I feel he achieved it.  You understand the way of the bushido and why the samurai did what they did. It blended well with the special effects and the human values and code of honor between Kai and Oishi were observed with respect.  I liked Keanu in this and loved his relationship with Hiroyuki Sanada (The Last Samurai).|, The ending just left me in tears.... It's a masterpiece.|, If they re-released this in theaters today it will do great since Keanu is on fire now|, would never get tired of this film. definitely one of his underrated works!|, Amazing film had me on the edge of my seat a few times, great storyline. Great people in it. Well made.|, ThIs turned out to be not only one of my favorite Keanu Reeves movies but 1 of my favorite movies period. The story was amazing; and I loved the love story part also. It was well acted. Very interesting. Very sad ending, but overall I thought it was a great movie,  I bought it!   The samurai were amazing. I love the whole respect aspect of the Asian culture.|, Saw the movie last night. Loved it!
I'm actually glad they went with a more supernatural take on the story...honestly there are waaaayy too many freaking historical stories in Chinese and Japanese film.  It's nice to see this film take that and move it into the supernatural.  It really makes it stand out from the rest. Very entertaining."

It's phenomenal.|, Just finished watching on Netflix. Amazing movie. Survival, sci-fi, dinosaurs, meteor's. Need more of such masterpiece movies 😍|, The movie was quite intense but interesting! The graphics were amazing and the lessons were beautifully taught! Despite the fact that verbal language was not necessarily utilised as much as one would expect in a sci-fi horror action film, the physical language displayed a plethora of perspectives and I quite enjoyed this piece. It may be found that people did not enjoy the fact there was barely any talking but I loved it. It portrayed another way to bring across a point.|, This movie was something ELSE man. Really took me by surprise just how intense and deep this movie is, and the setting is just so good.|, If this movie makes dinosaurs feel like frightening beasts that would be right outside your window while you sleep then I'm all for it. I like the atmosphere it gives and the question of ""are they going to survive"". Because the dinos are the least of their worries|, I ended up seeing the movie and while not re-inventing  the wheel, I found it to be a pretty entertaining movie, making most of its budget, cast and locations. The budget is blessedly not $450 million dollars or whatever Hollywood keeps spending on these tired, empty and dying blockbusters. 

It has pretty good production values and an ideal runtime for this type of movie. It isn't a remake, reboot, sequel or prequel. That is definitely a bonus. Plus, I liked the setting and timing of the movie. I saw it has pretty low scores and negative reviews and I am not sure any of it is deserved. But that's just me.|, I know this will have awesome scenes involving carnivores hunting the main characters, but I'd love some breaks from that with herbivores too. Some scenes of them walking alongside or coming across a herbivore or herd would be great. It would give the audience a moment to breathe from the action/horror and explore the setting more.|, Good movie. Watched it earlier today. The bond made between Driver and Koa was lovely to watch. And seeing dinosaurs other than those from Jurassic Park was very exciting!"

Do not sleep on this one and go see it for yourself! Easily a 10/10.|, Saw it on Prime. Much better than I imagined it would be. Definitely worth watching. Very well-made movie. 👍|, I have zero interest in football but will watch for these absolute legends.

I also hope that all relatives and friends of anyone who died from this are doing well, and have processed their grief, living in the memory of whoever they lost.|, I find it insane that there were people actually debating if they should leave or not.

“The world needs a sense of worth, and it will achieve it only by its people feeling they are worthwhile.” - Fred Rogers|, Amazing film, Tom Hanks literally disappeared when being in Mr Rogers character. Not sure who else could have pulled off this incredibly complex character study.|, I am a grown man who cried throughout this entire movie, and i'm not ashamed.|, I started crying and let all the depression out the moment he said ""it's okay to ask for help"". Hearing Mr Rogers saying that is so wholesome and filled me up with happiness.|, I’m not going to lie I choked up when he said:
“Sometimes we need to ask for help, and that’s ok.”|, Cried several times during the film, and so did my dad. Incredible film.|, Tom Hanks is 100% winning an Oscar for this.


I just know it.|, My great grandma just passed away, we had her in our house in hospice for 8 days before she left us. It's been a really hard month when you see family fighting with each other. About a week after the funeral, my grandpa took me to see this in the theater and I couldn't stop crying the whole movie. It just hit really close to home. That being said, it was a beautiful film and it's true. Only Tom Hanks could've done it so perfectly|, I’m from Australia, so I never heard of Mr Rogers, but I watched this movie lastnight and it made me wish I grew up watching his show. He seemed to be just about the most nicest, caring, kind-hearted person, from what I’ve learnt about him and his show. And reached out to a lot of kids (and adults) in need, emotionally/mentally. Just like the movie shows, with the character of Lloyd. How to deal with his emotions in a good and positive way. Especially when it comes to anger. Sometimes holding on can be more harmful for ourselves, than letting go.|, Watched this movie in theaters after being on the phone with a debt collection agency and after finding out my bf cheated on me. I came into the theater very upset and it really helped me manage my stress and anger. Almost like a therapeutic experience."

I really recommend you all watch it x|, This is an amazing trailer! Had heard nothing about this movie before seeing this but it's definitely going on my most anticipated list for next year.

It’s such a shame people are calling it logicless :( there should be more movies like this. Please. For those of us who understand 🥺|, THIS is how you make a trailer! You don't really know what's going on, but it leaves you wanting more. Haven't seem a trailer this good since The Revenant! Hopefully future trailers don't ruin it|, This definitely has Gore Verbinski's style written all over it!! I am so glad he has a new film coming out!!|, This looks absolutely amazing! I feel some Altered States, Jacobs Ladder, Clockwork Orange vibes. Plus it has the lead actor from Mr. Robot who is just phenomenal. It looks like a straight vision/experience transcending just viewing a typical film. I cant wait.|, Some trailers these days are just so freaking amazing."

I can tell you that dog is the only living thing that love you unconditionally|, wow this movie LOOKS AMAZING!!!!! 😃😃😃😃😃|, “When you come back, take care of Cj. She needs you like I needed you.” That sentence honestly makes me cry every time, it’s so moving, and when you see Cj with Molly/Bailey under her blanket in her bedroom it’s emotional because in the first movie, that’s exactly what Ethan did with Bailey. I like to think that our pets come back to us when they leave. Just like the song by Phillip Phillips. “I love you long after you’re gone, gone, gone...” ❤️|, I've never cried so hard to a trailer before, but this hits different|, This movie is by far the most amazing movie I've seen in my life. Both A Dog's Purpose and this left a huge impact on my life and I'm so glad I've seen it. Thank you.|, I was bawling my eyes out at the trailer then casually Henry just appears and puts the biggest smile on my face.|, Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, highly recommend.

I think she has a story to tell too.|, I cried during this movie so hard. It's the sweetest thing ever. I loved it!|, I watched this movie and can honestly say, it's one of the most touching stories ever. The love and loyalty that our four legged family members have for us is beyond this world.|, I’ve never cried so much in my life than in the 2 hours of watching this movie. My cat enjoyed the scene where Bella was play fighting with baby cougar. Eyes were locked to the screen.|, I watched the full movie, and may I say, I don't cry often. I bawled my eyes out and my parents thought something was wrong. 10/10 would recommend to friends. In my opinion this was the best dog movie I have seen in a L O N G time.|, My dog recently passed away and this movie helped me alot to gain my hope and my motivation back. i dont know why but im suddenly looking forward to the new things that will come. thank you to the  people who create this movie it has a powerful message  and a deep  meaning to me|, Almost everyone had that moment of losing their dog at one point. Mine happened when she ran away around Christmas season and she’s less than 1 year old. She is still not used going outside so she took the chance when I left my gate open. I bawled my eye out looking for her when there’s a lot of blocks and alleys on our area. It’s really hard to feel that helplessness. I’m just so lucky I got her back on the same night! Sad tho is I lost my rescued kitten just this Christmas season and it still makes me sad when I think about her. :(|, This movie is amazing highly recommend it im pretty sure everyone in the movie theater was balling and smiling the whole time I loved this movie and made me love my dog Bella even more 😭❤️|, Just watched this movie a week ago...... and man did I cry.... the last scene where she returns to the veterans home I cried harder than I ever cried in a year or so. Lovely movie my dog loved it too.|, This movies is just awesome. The bond between a dog and it's owner is perfectly described. A worth watching."
A Fantastic Woman,A Fantastic Woman | Official Trailer HD (2017),PJHex4ZitgA,916209,3183,349,"i haven't seen this movie yet, but i've hear amazing things of it. the best thing is that knowing how conservative and lgbtphobic my country is, seeing this is a breathe of fresh air, and an important step for the lgbt community from this country who have yet a long way before we can all be accepted and able to go out without fearing violence.|, It was one of the first movies I saw when I moved to Chicago, I saw it by myself at the Music Box Theatre. At the time, I was feeling a lot of emotions, being on my own and without my family. It was snowing when I left the movie, dark and cold. I walked to the bus stop and waited, listening to the soundtrack. It was lonely but memorable and beautiful in a way.|, I watched this movie for the first time with no sound ….just the subtitles ……(I was on a plane with no headphones)it shocked me when I read in subtitles about her name being different ….it was only then I realized she was trans 
          Since then I watched it with sound 
And I must say it was one of the most romantic  deep films I have seen in a long time ………..to the very end with the song they chose for the credits …. I was moved ❤|, I vividly remember the day my judgmental mind was opened, and it felt so good that it still makes me cry. Live, let live!|, One of the best movies I have ever seen.

I went to see it the night it came out and when it was over, I was left with this incredibly overwhelming feeling of uncertainty. The pacing was slow but that's what the movie is all about, a ghost observing life around him moving on while being unable to move on himself. Highly recommend it. The soundtrack is amazing too.|, I have enjoyed many movies from A24. Being deaf, I am very glad to see that A24 provided captions for this trailer to make it accessible for us. I've shared this with my deaf and hard of hearing peers. Appreciate the access, and look forward to this movie!|, I’ve probably watched this movie 5 or 6 times, I like introducing friends to it and seeing their reaction. It always ends in tears. So heartbreaking but so beautiful. I think the tears come from the beauty of it all.|, No joke, I was a alone in my auditorium for the entire showtime. It really helped me get into the tone and atmosphere of the film.|, It's a great movie. You have to sit through Rooney Mara eating a pie for 10 minutes straight but even that has a profound meaning that makes it worth it.|, *One of the saddest movies ever existed. You literally feel empty inside during whole journey and there is no fulfillment afterwards, just more emptiness and sadness.*|, This is a reminder of what cinema should be. Films now are way too gimmicky, we don't really feel anything. This film is evocative, heartbreaking yet beautiful and strongly poignant. The cinematography is incredible and it captures everything great about films and why film is the best medium. Forget ridiculous dialogue and 250+ million dollar budgets, films should stay with you long after the credits roll and there is no doubt 'A Ghost Story' does that. In a nutshell 'A Ghost Story' is a beautiful reminder of why films are so important to me.|, Probably the most life changing cinematic experience I've ever had was watching this with my friend in an empty theater. Love this film so much!|, I absolutely love this movie.  I was a little unsure and disappointed at first.  The pie scene was brutal getting through.  But showed real time.  Which is important to the film. I think it's best watched alone with no interruptions.  Magnificent movie.|, This is a type of movie you should watch not for its entertainment value but mainly for its atmosphere. It's interesting to see a movie about moving on but not from a person who lost someone but it's the other way around."

Everytime I see the trailer it makes me want to see it. then part of the way through the movie I remember how it's not a die hard film. it's an action film with Bruce Willis in it.|, I don't care how bad the movie is. This trailer is badass as hell.|, when the trailer is 10 times better than the actual movie..|, I will say this: Bruce Willis seems more awake in the trailer than he did in the actual movie.|, Die Hard 4: his daughter
Die Hard 5: his son
Die Hard 6: his grandkids with granpa Willis in a wheel chair still kicking ass|, Me & my boy here gonna put a whooping on ya. That line always makes me laugh 😂|, It's sad watching all the die hards and seeing Bruce Willis get older |, This trailer was 100000x better than the movie|, omg its so insane i love the action...i love bruce willis...|, Another really good Die Hard film despite his age.  The action in this film was just as good as all his other Die Hard films.  He still gives it his all.  Really good note to go out in.  Glad he got to reconcile with kids but sad about not being with his wife at the end.   That would have made it."

Excellent movie. : )|, The only kind of horror movie that I can handle |, This movie was awesome. Had a lot of good laughs, it brought something new to the table and I loved it because it made fun of the stupid PA films.

Sadly we can't have movies like this with modern culture.|, When she said ""By the powers vested in me, that somebody gave me while I was locked up"" I died lmao.|, Father Doug has to be the funniest character I've ever seen.|, You know, when Malcolm told Ray to drive like he's got warrants, I didn't expect him to literally have warrants.|, Just wish they would have done A Haunted House 3|, 1:00:04 is when the prison scene begins.|, I'm happy that I get to watch this I saw the first one and laughed my but off all the way till the end|, This one remains a classic|, One of the best comic movies ever"

They have been well made and fun to watch.|, Now THIS is how you make a sequel. Throw the characters into a different genre, and watch it unfold. This looks like it's going to be better than the last two movies. Very few movies are afraid to switch genres, especially with the third movie in the series. For that reason alone, I hope that this is a great success. It's great when movies try something different.|, It's heartening to see that Michelle Yeoh is finally getting the recognition she deserves and getting offered more diverse roles than the usual Asian archetypes.|, I LOVE that they're taking a different spin on this third one. the cinematography looks stunning. and for someone who's usually too scared to watch actual horror movies, this one looks just palatable enough for me to handle. can't wait.|, I love that we have these detective films with Branagh’s Poirot and Craig’s Blanc. Now all we need is Downey’s Holmes to make a comeback. It’s a nice genre of film that is a breath of fresh air|, Loved loved loved the movie! Murder mysteries are always a win for me. Also, you can never go wrong with an Agatha Cristie novel adaptation. Perfect watch for Halloween! The casting was great paired with eerie atmosphere and throbbing suspense. Don't mind the critic and go watch the movie already.|, It probably won't be a full on horror movie, but the mere presence of those semi-horror elements makes this one of the most unusual but also interesting ideas I've seen this year. I'm curious how well it'll do after release.|, Obviously, David Souchet will always be the Hercule Poirot. 

However, what Kenneth Brannagh is bringing to the cinematic with Poirot is truly wonderful, and I hope this is a universe that brings many more stories to the big screen cause I am all for it 😊|, The first two movies were superb but this, this was something else. The cinematography, the performance of Poirot, everything. It is one of the most unique and creative Agatha Christie adaptations I've ever seen. Please do not stop making them, I'll watch each and every one.|, I watched this movie  yesterday in Paris. For me is the best of the trilogy. Lovely photography. Venice was so beautiful on screen. The best performances were Kenneth and Michell, and also the boy reading EAP. This is about to be my favorite Halloween movie for a while. Congratulations to Kenneth Branagh and to this team of actors 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"

What a beautiful line. 👏🏽 
“I have to stand up to evil”.|, ""It is better to suffer an injustice than to do it"". A line from this beautiful film. Is it slow? Yes. Is it really long? Yes. Is it worth watching? Yes. This is not popcorn entertainment. It is a heartbreaking and thought-provoking sermon that will challenge the viewer to consider their own convictions, and whether or not they would stand up to evil.|, I saw this yesterday. One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen! Others cannot compare. It's like the beauty of a hushed whisper, or the silence of a mind at the height of indescribable pain.|, Franz was true to God and the church when his own clergymen were traitors. A truly saintly man. His wife, Fani, was likewise true. Both deserve praise and respect.|, This trailer made me cry.  It takes a lot of strength to stand up for what you believe is right even if it will cost you your life.|, This movie should have gotten way more attention than it did. Beautifully relevant.|, I've watched this trailer, oh, maybe a half dozen times, and the combination of words, images and music still brings tears to my eyes.  I say this knowing that most of the movie-going audience will never understand or enjoy this type of narrative sadly.  If a movie (or any piece of art) does not make you feel a true emotion beyond excitement, how good is it really?|, After watching this movie, it wasn't a matter of seeing what I wanted to see but that of what I needed to see.
if nothing else, it asks us to stick to our convictions no matter how difficult they may be. We're all the better of for it.|, Absolutely eye opening.  Rest in Peace, Franz. You are a true hero.

I love Tom Hanks!

Definitely my favorite actor, next to James Dean. I truly appreciate sophisticated acting.|, Looking forward to this movie! Haven't been excited about a movie for a long time|, I love it when I can save 90 minutes by watching a whole movie in two and a half minutes.|, Why haven't I heard of this?  Maybe my memory loss contributed to this (i had two seizures in one day and it knocked my brain out something fierce), but I am a huge movie buff and I can't believe I am now just seeing this trailer!|, all love for tom hanks, i can't wait to watch the movie <3|, Can never go wrong with a Tom Hanks movie|, I caught it today..opening day matinee. The imagery of Saudi Arabia is incredible. It has tremendous space to it. It's a mature, wise, very unusual film. Extremely different than anything I've sen before.

At the same time I""m taking pics of the two us to put in an album for him. I told his mom that when I croak she is to find it and give it to Cal.

What that tells you about this film is that it's intelligent writing that respects the audience, the linear story proceeds at a moderate pace, there is no one-on-one violence, modesty in the sex scene, and a happy ending.  Oh, and beautiful clothes.  All these factors make for a very decent movie for mature adults -- harder and harder to find these days.  I hope that some others I've seen trailers for will be decent as well:  Brooklyn; Testament of Youth; Suite Francaise; Far From the Madding Crowd. Woman in Gold was also appreciated.  Note that many of these are British films.|, I really love this movie. The final sequence with the fountains and the ballet is visually astonishing. One of the best scenography ever.|, “Although the elements may treat us cruelly, in the end we have only our instincts. Patience, care, and a little warmth from the sun are our best hope.” - Just Loved this quote by Kate Winslet|, Love this movie! Amazing cast, amazing picture and costumes and amazing music!|, Kate doesn't always do good movies, but she always delivers excellent performances. She looks great as usual. |, I love period dramas. cant get enough of them|, It was such a beautiful movie, I plan on watching it again. The story line had me captivated.|, Even making allowances for Hair & Makeup magic, Kate Winslet never seems to stop being beautiful.

I really enjoy them and I always love how Tyler gives us all messages to reflect on life.  Kudos Tyler :)|, I can't wait to see it. I love Tyler Perry's work. A lot of people hate it because it's not like all of the other Hollywood material but that's what makes it good. Plus he always has a life lesson in each movie/play.|, I love the Madea movies, its not just about the comedy, but the inspirational message behind each of the movies.|, i don't understand... Tyler Perry's movies aren't dumb. they're satirical and usually have a very valuable life lesson. especially the movies which are play adaptions. why doesn't everyone love madea! |, I love all of the Tyler Perry movies with Madea in them. I would have to say that this one is my favorite thus far! :)|, I love the movie and I like how tyler perry switch the role around and made it about us being the racist ones because we all can be racist. Racism is not a black thing or white thing its an everybody thing. At the end of the day, u got ur racism in every race so lets not make this movie out to be something new because its not. I love that tyler perry is not afraid to go there with racism from both perspectives. I mean u got to respect that out of man.|, I love Tyler Perry's movies:) even with the madea ones I think their really awesome and I can't wait to see more from him:)|, I made a huge mistake watching this movie. I have fallen helplessly in love with Tika Sumpter.❤️
Tyler always kills me!🤣👍🏻|, Loved this movie, funny, entertaining, and it teaches people a lesson or two, saw it on Netflix highly recommended|, I seen this last night.Loved it.Good story and good acting."

You can have the worst day and after sitting down to watch one of his movies, your whole outlook changes. He brings light to any dark day|, Joe needs his own movie 🙏🏽🙏🏽🐐🐐😂😂|, Thank you Tyler, I've watched every Madea movie and they never fail to make me laugh. Sad to know that this is the final one, but all good things come to end. I enjoyed the ride Hallelujer🙏|, This is an awesome movie. Once again Tyler Perry dones the Madea role and does not disappoint. this movie is hilarious i could not stop laughing Madea is one of my favorite characters in any of Tyler Perry's movies she is in. I love this movie, the acting is good, the comedy is good, the story is good and the directing is good. I hope we see more of Madea. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do rating 5/5|, I miss the old Madea movies that had great actors and when the movie had more chunks of it being about a serious topic, issue, etc. Examples like Madeas family reunion, diary of a mad black women, Madea goes to jail, I can do bad all by myself. Those movies had (in my opinion) a stronger well thought out story and a cast that could actually act compared to the Madea Halloween movie.
Edit: In the Halloween movie it's hard to take the ""serious"" parts seriously when the acting makes me cringe and I feel like its harder to connect with the characters. In that movie, I didn't care that much for the characters. With I Can Do Bad All By Myself, as an example, I was invested in April (Taraji) and the kids. I also feel like the balence between the comidic and the seriousness of the plot was great. But of course this is all just my opinion. I'd love to hear your thoughts.|, Only Madea can make a funeral hilarious 🙌|, Madea still has 200 plus years to go plus Madea hasn’t gone to space yet.|, I adore Madea's character and the stories behind the movies are full of wisdom and inspiration. I just hope it's not true that this will be Madea's last movie. Tyler Perry is truly talented and his movies are both hilarious and spiritually fueled. Don't stop making movies with Madea. Love her!!! Lol|, don't stop doing Madea movies man she's a great character|, Pelo amor de DEEEEUS que esse filme estreie no BRAZIL tbm.....I LOVE MADEA ❤❤❤😍😍😍🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷"
A Man Called Otto,A MAN CALLED OTTO - Official Trailer (HD),eFYUX9l-m5I,15243625,47616,5123,"Just saw this. This movie delivers a very strong message about how we should cherish our memories and live a full life at the same time, no matter the age. Don't get trapped in the past, it becomes a burden too heavy to carry.|, I loved that the protagonist grew and started to heal with the help of platonic friends (particularly Marisol's family) and neighbors and not with the help of a romantic interest. We need more movies like this. It was absolutely the best one I've seen in a while. So many amazing messages and it was just absolutely touching. There are many people struggling just like Otto, and sometimes with a little compassion, love, patience and a dash of humor we may just be able to be a ""Marisol"" to someone or an ""Otto"" to someone like Malcolm and vice versa or really any of the amazing characters in this film that loved one another (particularly Otto) when they most needed it and help them through the darkness to the light. 
⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐|, I have never left a review on a movie, but this movie was special. The story is not complicated, but it touches your soul. Everything about this movie was exceptional. I am currently crying writing this review.|, just finished watching this on netflix and I'm still bursting into tears, from this film I came to understand the life of senior citizens who are more than just humans who are enjoying their old age but also they still have to deal with their own problems . This film really opened up my way of understanding senior citizens and moved my heart to become a personality like Marisol, as I am a 19-year-old human being who has never acknowledged senior citizens like Otto himself. so yeah... this is a movie you must see once in your lifetime . 
💙|, Everyone needs a marisol in their life ❤️|, I was not expecting this movie to be this great,  this amazing.  Every character is well developed and the human connection is amazing.  Be sure to have a full box of tissues when you watch it.|, My wife and I were in Pittsburgh for an appointment, arrived way too early so we went for a walk. We saw a film crew setting up, they had streets blocked off, so for curiosities sake we stood by and watched for a moment. Out of nowhere, Tom Hanks walked right up to my wife and I... even though he was wearing a face mask he was instantly recognizable and as he approached my wife said ""OMG it's Tom Hanks""!!! Mr Hanks pretended to look about frantically and said ""REALLY? WHERE????!!!"" and we laughed. He stood and talked to us, took a photo with us, and was so kind. Anyway, he did that because we were in an area where we weren't supposed to be, and someone on the film crew was about to come over and yell at us and Tom Hanks scolded the person and decided to just come over and talk to us, rather than someone yelling at us. We had no idea what actor was there or even why the camera's were being set up, we were just people going for a walk. Thank you Mr Hanks for making our day that day, and for your overwhelming kindness!|, Absolutely beautiful movie. I’ve never been married but this film really conveyed the loneliness you can go through when you lose your life partner. Not ashamed to say I absolutely bawled my eyes out. I hope to find a girl that completed me the way Sonya did Otto. And to everyone reading this, you’re never alone and even after losing someone so pivotal, there will always be enough love around you to help you through, sometimes you just gotta look for it ❤️|, I’m 28 and lost my dad suddenly to a stroke almost 5 years ago. My family blew apart at the seems and I moved home from college thinking we would grieve together, but have been the only person living in the house we all grew up in since, which is like living in a loop of both what was and what you wish still was, the most 

Not too proud to say life’s been a mess: I have been so lonely, angry and shut out from the world since he’s been gone that I am quite indeed a young Otto… but I almost felt like my dad was talking to me through the movie telling me that it’s okay to keep living without him. I broke down multiple times and that’s something I haven’t let myself do enough. Thank you Tom Hanks ❤️ 

Check on your friends. You never know what battles they’re fighting|, Tom Hanks never fails to deliver. Touching movie with meaningful life messages."

You can't understand the power and emotion behind this line without watching the movie or reading the book. Kudos to the actors. This was so amazing the last pages broke my heart.|, This movie isnt just a movie , it is the reality that eventually happens for all of us. You either accept it or it will break you piece by piece. This is what the movie wants to show.|, I watched the movie by chance a week before my son died. I always remember the phrase: it's okay to be angry. The movie really helped me to understand my feelings.|, My mother died of cancer when I was ten. I’ve seen this movie like 5 times and I’ve read the book twice and honestly this totally resonates with me. The part were she says “I wish I had a hundred years... a hundred years I could give to you” I always shed a tear. It’s hard but sometimes you just have to let go because no matter what “You will make it through.”|, This story reminds me off my loss of my father to terminal cancer. The emotions we see the boy going through is like watching me when it happened 8 years ago.
My father was also an artist, just like Lizzie. It really gave me the chills, when he opened that book of drawings, because my mom and I did the same thing with my fathers drawings. 

I really felt this movie. 
Great acting, great story.|, ""It's okay that your angry I'm angry too.  And if you need to break things, by God you break them!""  It gets me every time|, I randomly decided to watch this movie today in theater, I had no idea what it was about and only chose it because I liked the movie poster. But DAMN it must be the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. The whole movie theater was crying and sobbing. Damn beautiful, respect to the people who made this movie. Only a person without soul wouldn't like this movie.|, One of the most beautiful quotes from this trailer: “Break the windows.” “Break them yourself.” Ohh, I get chills.|, I don't think I've ever cried from a movie as bad as I just did.

It is heartbreaking and Amanda acted so well|, Amanda is magical. She deserves lots and lots of awards. ♥️👋👋👋👋👋|, If this trailer is any reflection of the content of the movie, this movie is what happened to me after I had my youngest son. I lost myself for an entire year and found out I suffered from Postpartum OCD. I hope movies like this make people understand what women with PPD, PPOCD, and any other Postpartum mental illness endure. Telling us to get over it will not help we need to be taken seriously, we need understanding and we need help from people in the Mental Health field i.e. phycologist and physiatrist. There is nothing worse than suffering from a disorder trying to get better and on top of that having no one believes you or is mad at you for being sick.|, I watched this the other day and I was crying like a water faucet. It's not perfect, but it nails the despondency and hopelessness of what someone who is suicidal is going through.|, I had postpartum depression with my son. I hated myself. It was the darkest time of my life. I couldn’t even look at my son with joy. Had overwhelming feelings of guilt. It’s torture as a mother, though I’m happy to say that that period of my life is over and I’ve been on medication that has helped greatly. You are not alone.|, I had PPD and it turned into PTSD...my son is now 15 and I still have days when I remember how hard it was and I can't catch my breath, the title is pretty accurate. This is why I am very vocal about my struggles...it doesn't do anyone any good to pretend you have the perfect Instagram worthy life. Women need to lift each other up and share their struggles.|, I can’t tell if she lost the baby, or what really happened from there(please tell me haha) but I’m glad they chose Amanda for such a well deserved topic. For me, I connect to her because of her role as Sophie in Mamma Mia. My name is Sophie, and funny enough my dad left just like how she lost her dad (though it was undecided who of 3 men it was, my mother knows for sure who my father is). She’s such an amazing actress, and I’m glad people who suffer from whatever devastating mental crisis will get recognized by someone who is so good at her job.|, Glad Finn is being explored as the great actor he is ❤️|, Amanda can never do bad movies|, I didn't know what it was until my sister went through it. I never had kids, so I have three sisters who did and it was so hard for her and I wasn't able to reach her or help her because she was so private about everything in her life. It wasn't until many years later that she finally to me what she went through and I felt so sad that I wasn't there for her enough."

There isn't allot of dialog going on but still manages to tell a great story. The scenes are very immersive and create a strong connection with the main character. Not the easiest film to watch, but it's good to see there are still movies being made portraying a realistic view of darkness and brutality that's still going on in this world.|, This movie transports you to a whole other world - one that is visceral, surreal, tribal, and profane. It's manifestation of the ability of the human spirit to find strength, beauty, warmth, and humanity in the bleakest of circumstances also makes it sacred. Don't miss this great work of art.|, Lived right there in Thailand, in the town this movie started in for over a year. The detail and cultural adaptations are spot on. Should have been nominated for best picture, or at least for best independent or foreign film. You really can’t gauge how well done this was unless you’ve spent enough actual time in Thailand though, and critics are usually arrogant, cynical pricks with very little perspective. So, I’m not surprised, but do WATCH IT. It’s fantastic!!|, This film is really good, had my heart beating fast the entire time. Very strong and not an easy watch but the fight to survive was really felt in this film. Great acting also.|, Looks sick!|, This movie broke me in a good way. Made me think for days and didn’t leave my mind. Just loved it|, This movie was amazing, one of my personal favorites of last year and yet I didn't hear ANYBODY talking about it. It wasn't in any of the ""best of the year"" list of any major film site and it's a damn shame.
Kudos to the whole crew for making such an intense piece and mainly to Joe Cole for giving the acting of a life time.|, As someone who is today, this very moment dealing with their own demons, overcoming fears and breaking through, this trailer hit at the very core of my being. It rendered me in flood of tears. We are all reflections of one another. And, life covers the entire spectrum of most profound beauty, pleasure and also deep neverending well of suffering with a glimmer of hope, of salvation - a flickering candle shining even brighter on the face of the Buddha - a unversal  symbol for freedom from suffering....|, This portrays the gritty side of Thailand so well and also the kindness of Thai people. I lived in Thailand for 15 years. This is very realistic.|, This is one of the best movies I've seen. 10/10. There are some disturbing scenes though, not everyone has the stomach for it. The fact that this is based on real life makes it even more crazy"

Rosamund nailed it, the movie was painfull and it is a must watch for everyone that wants to know more about war!|, This film was brilliant. Terrifying and heart wrenchingly realistic.|, Pretty damn good movie...well worth a couple of hours of your time.|, At last. A film on the life of Marie Colvin, one of the bravest and daring journalists I've ever known. She was and is still one of the greatest.|, I was wrong about Dornan. Ever since I saw him in the British show “the fall” I knew he had potential and he’s doing good and is being offered more drama/actions roles which he does well with more than “romance”.|, How did she alter the entire sound of her voice for this? Not so easy as it seems, like most things, really...What an actress! Looking forward it ❤️|, One of the bests I have ever watched. Truths of war is not spoken and shown to the world by many but bravest ones like Marie.|, Mrs. Pike is killing it in Hollywood, she is the poster woman of super tough roles. She seems fearless.

God is so so so good, he has everything planned out when we thought everything is over.
Great movie to watch over and over again.|, All things work together for the good of them that love the LORD and are called to His purpose! Amazing movie! ❤❤❤|, I can’t tell y’all how many times I’m going to watch this. I’m 13 now but I remember watching this a few year ago when I was younger. I remember SOME parts but I obviously didn’t really know exactly what was going on but it’s fun to watch a movie when your older and understand it in a totally different way. 💖🔥🔥|, Such an honor to be an extra in this film in the church scene.  Ironically, I had just lost my beloved niece (aka 2nd daughter) during this same timeframe to a senseless car accident. She too was an organ donor.  I know what it feels like to be angry at God.  I have to also forgive the person that killed my beloved niece who only received 4 years of incarceration for this senseless accident. She had plans to come take care of me as her second mom out of state and plans (a paid scholarship) were in place for her to become a Registered Nurse. She was a giving person and took care of the needs of homeless people, her Elders, and those struggling with drug addiction.  Her story made the news in Columbus, Ohio but also made the news in California. Her funeral attendance included people standing in a line that covered numerous blocks of people waiting to see her.  She was loved by thousands. I pray this film is a blessing to you.  Jasmine Handon (my beloved niece aka daughter) of Columbus, Ohio will never be forgotten. ❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼Blessings!!!!|, I really felt the spirit of the Lord working while watching this movie, thank you for this & god bless everyone who reads thru the comments.|, This was well written and executed with seasoned actors. This is as real as it gets. This is the type of impact that is needed in entertainment. There's nothing more powerful than  living a life of walking by Faith and not by sight. Tearing up rt now. Have faith in God. ❤|, Movie tore my heart out for the family who lost their Son. I wept and wept. I have had a very traumatic accident myself where I spent 4 days shy of seven months in the hospital when I was just 17 years old. I pray this evening for all families going through something similar as this family. Our family just had a similar accident in our own lives.  God bless everyone who reads these words. Psalms 34:17

A Quiet Place,A Quiet Place (2018) - Official Trailer - Paramount Pictures,WR7cc5t7tv8,34097371,158206,12214,"All jokes aside, this was actually an impressive survival-suspense thriller. Most people who criticize it can’t imagine what it would be like. It’s easy to make jokes from the safety of modern convenience. 
Personally, I thought the film did an amazing job of translating the themes and supporting details of the plot. The cast was incredibly good and the suspense was top notch. For a scary movie that had little violence, minimal gore, and even less sound, it was ACTUALLY scary.|, The Guy who wrote the dialogues in this movie is a genius|, It's not too scary but it for sure has you on the edge of your seat! The cinematography is AMAZING and the ability to share such a story with little to no dialog is just outstanding!|, This movie is one of the best I've ever seen, and the sequel is even better!!! Kudos to John Krasinski!|, This movie is great. Keeps you in suspense. For those that like to close their eyes in horror scenes, I doubt they will in this one. The actors did a fantastic job.|, Was watching this in the theater with my cousin, I bought a water and opened it but apparently it was carbonated water and made a loud TSSST sound during a tense moment. I had to leave the theater for a few minutes because I couldn’t stop laughing lol.|, This movie is a metaphor of when you try to get food in the middle of the night|, I love how this movie is set in 2020, and, considering how this year has been nothing but bad news at this point, I won't be surprised if the world gets destroyed by aliens next month.|, Oh God I cried sooo hard. John's performance was absolutely outstanding. Has to get an Oscar for that last scene 😭❤️❤️❤️|, Whoever wrote this movies script has a great taste in literature! Every word that came out all of the characters mouth was just absolutely astonishing! Some words in the movie would most definitely perplex the average human mind! Especially when they would use words with more then 5 syllables. All in all, the script is the most original, creative, and ingenious piece of literature the world has ever known. And the person whom wrote it is the most innovative and canny person at their job!"

The first one was such a well done film full of tension. Trying to stay quiet has never been more terrifying.|, I just got back from seeing this movie with my friends, it was so intense and you genuinely couldn’t look away even when it was most terrifying, the music, the acting just everything was perfect. The whole theater was so insanely quiet, and all of us were holding our breath the entire time. I’m usually not a fan of horror but this was one of the best I’ve seen in awhile❤️❤️|, The kid who played Marcus really deserves an award like I was genuinely convinced he was actually hurt irl that’s how good his acting was.|, Not every sequel turns out great but goodness this was extremely well done. The actors showing the emotion, to the atmosphere and the suspense. Cant wait for part 3|, I’m so sorry for the monsters who can’t see Emily Blunt.|, I cried at the ending of both movies. The atmosphere is so well done I feel like I’m there feeling the emotions with all the characters. It’s so intense|, Emily Blunt and her husband John Krasinski, an actor and director at the same time, were creative in this movie, they deserve an Academy Award.|, This is the best horror series in DECADES! Smart, unpredictable and extremely tense. Acting and directing is top shelf.|, What an amazing movie and experience. I didn’t realise how much I missed the movie theater. The community, the size and sound was just magical. Love the scenes where the director shows how it is being perceived from the deaf daughter. Really recommend it.|, I watched this last night and it’s amazing. Incredible acting, everyone’s so talented especially the daughter, she’s deaf in real life too. And it is emotional too just like the first one. Both movies made me cry. I think there will be a third one too with the way this one ended"

Reminds me of my mother and auntie doing this. Auntie is exactly same age as lillabet. My mum was the rebel like Margaret. It is special movie to me.|, Why is Margaret so homely?! Did the casting directors never see a picture of the real Margaret? She was breathtaking.|, This hits different now. 
Rest in peace Queen Elizabeth|, I just love this film kinda relatable I grew up in a very rich family in the eighties in Australia And my friends were always annoyed that I couldn't go out I went out when I was eighteen and  had a fairytale night and fell in love with a man he is wonderful and kind and funny and my bestest friend I have three daughters Carla, sara and Diana named after the princess. This film touched my heart|, Brilliant movie. Framed correctly (as Lionsgate really didn't) this is perhaps the most significant of all of the many films involving UK royalty. It captures quite vividly the start of a once-in-a-millenium sea-change. The vital initiative of MINGLING. It was not Diana and then Harry & Meghan who began this. It was George VI (with his close buddy Churchill) during WWII, and then Princess Elizabeth from shortly before the time of this movie, and then the Duke of Edinburgh, who initiated the heavy lifting. For decades Elizabeth mingled, with up to 1000 groups and communities and enterprises a year - many far from the UK - praising their worth and enforcing their connectedness. Socially and economically this really mattered. Diana and Harry & Meghan meant well, but their own mingling was rather rudderless. No wonder ""Elizabeth"" in the movie's very last frames is so joyfully empowered and magnetic. She had just brought a severely depressed airman back from the brink. She knows now that she can mingle purposefully. An inspired and actually not-so-lightweight movie|, Just discovered this last night and absolutely loved it!|, this film is sooo good! would recommend 10/10 👏🏻|, I didnt expect much from the movie but oh well I LOVED IT, it was an amazing journey and can I get a Jack myself please? Its a MUST watch|, surprisingly loved this film! WATCH IT NOW PEOPLE!"

never gonna forget these movies|, When you finally realize ""A silent voice"" is not a story about a guy failing in love with a girl, it's about a guy being able and love himself again.|, You know a movie is amazing when you come back to watch the trailer after watching the movie.|, I love how the trailer doesn't have any dialogue, almost as if they're drawing us into the world of being deaf, and teaching us how to listen.|, I finished watching it exactly 10 minutes ago. I think it's enough to say that my eyes where already tearing up during the first 20 minutes of the film, so you can probably imagine the rest. It left me with a feeling I can't really describe, with a smile on my face but tears in my eyes. The movie touched a lot of things that I also have dealt with. All I can say is that it will stick with me forever and I'm glad it does so.|, When all the X's fell off their faces, I started balling|, Life was as usual, I did my chores, my schoolwork, and played videogames afterwards. I had no concrete plans in life and just went with the flow. I had a bit of an interest in anime after discovering Ghibli and I came across Silent Voice. The movie just had this familiar feeling. Over the years of viewing violence and other bad influences my heart was basically hardened and my senses became dull. this movie softened me and made me appreciate my life. I wasn't depressed or having suicidal thoughts, I just didn't care about anything. I felt content as long I could procrastinate. In a way, the people in this movie are the ones I look up to the most, even if they're not real and it's just a movie. To me, it was more than just some movie, and it was something that I will cherish forever. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. When I finished the movie I made a decision: whether I'd stay put and do the same thing forever or live the life the characters had and cultivated. I chose to make a change in search of happiness. I felt quite sad after finishing the movie, I forced myself to study afterwards and be as responsible as I can. Yes, it didn't feel the way things did in the movie and it was outside of my comfort zone  but I knew this is what's going to help me change. I stopped playing videogames completely because I couldn't control myself otherwise and tried to be strict on myself. In a few days, I decided to study Japanese, I figured if I lived in Japan, I would feel close to the life I wanted. It was the first big decision I made and the first time I took initiative in my own life. I discovered Kyoto Animations and their other works like K-On, and Violet Evergarden, up until now I play an Electric Guitar aspire to be like Violet; strong and diligent. It was the happiest time of my life after I discovered Silent Voice and I've changed a lot since. I usually would go against talking about this openly but I want people to come across this comment and know that they really can make a big change if they start now. I know very well that it's not easy at the beginning but use the people in the movie as an example and live your life to its fullest, whatever that means for you. I myself am having trouble, it's almost been a year since I saw the movie and I reverted back to square one unfortunately. I haven't studied Japanese in a few months and I'm feeling gloomier as time goes on, but I sure as heck am not giving up. Nonetheless, I just wanted to share my experience with this movie and with KyoAni's works in general, because their works are ones that can change your life, Silent Voice is a good example. Sorry if this was lengthy, I did my utmost to describe my experience without writing too much. Thanks and take care."

I got chills because it reminded me of few women I knew. I recognized myself from both women because they are caricatures, but their chemistry was pretty authentic. I was anxious, because some of the lines were so real, it felt like I had heard them before, but this time I knew they were manipulative and filled with lies.|, This film is incredible. Could tell the entire cinema were engrossed and heard multiple people after gushing over it. Never heard such a reaction to a film. Loved it 10/10|, This film really showcases both Blake's and Anna's talents. The film itself not so much but the roles are such a booster for both actresses.|, This movie might End up just being another thriller cliche but the advert deserves an award!

A Tale of Love and Darkness,A Tale of Love and Darkness Official Trailer 1 (2016) - Natalie Portman Movie,N2Jd6COX9Q0,1019929,4643,493,"thats it! Natalie Portman deserve an Oscar. This woman is already reach over her capabilities for an Oscar.|, Guys, you say the film is biased. Yes it is. Reason: it's not a historical film, it's a biographical film based on a novel by Amos Oz. What we see in the film is what the child sees. Not an adult journalist, who actually would have some opportunity to uncover the truth and seek for fainess. It's mostly a story about a boy and his parents. He is ignorant in some aspects, but due to the fact he is just a child. He is too busy figuring out what people his parents are. It's a classic ""they were told the new world and new life is awaiting, but still were haunted with ghosts of their past"" story. Especially, when it comes to the character of the mother.|, Looks amazing! Can't wait to watch it!|, Natalie is back! Love this actress!|, I was never a big Portman fan but man, this looks really good|, Looks incredible, Natalie is an amazing woman|, I've been replaying it in the background while I study or eat just to hear Hebrew. Such a beautiful language :)|, This looks soooooo  good. Is it out already?|, The trailer is visually stunning. excellent cinematography...looking forward|, So proud of her"
A Taxi Driver,A Taxi Driver Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Indie,bB7z4Xn5oNA,1304505,9826,659,"This trailer went from a funny comedy movie to a serious historical drama in a matter of seconds!|, Don't watch this movie without a box of tissues ready. Such a powerful film that celebrates ordinary people who are heroes in extraordinary circumstances.|, i just finished watching this movie and i’m typing this with tears running down my eyes, and yes, i’ve been crying nonstop since the second half of the movie. if i could give more than one like for this trailer, i would. this is truly a masterpiece. i couldn’t imagine something like this did happened. even just by watching the movie i cried my eyes out, i couldn’t imagine how devastating and shattered everyone was at that time especially the people of Gwangju. i hope to see more film like this.|, my mom was a student protestor at Chunnam University in Gwangju in this period. she and her family lived through the martial law period. so watching this with her was a very emotional experience. never forget the Gwangju Massacre.|, Just finished watching this movie and oml i did not expect the amount of tears i shed 😭😭 This movie was absolutely amazing 💯💯|, I rewatched this movie for the fourth time and I still bawled like a little kid. If you have a weak heart prepare a box of tissue because this is a beautiful movie that will bring tears in your eyes|, Hermosa película. Acabo de terminar de verla y me partió el alma que nunca se pudieron ver de nuevo :( 
Muy recomendada. Veanla.|, The fact that this is a true story makes me cry, us citizens who weren't even in Gwangju thought the ones who were suffering was the soldiers because of a lie that has been spread ""student protesters became violent about the situation and started to kill soldiers"" 
Even when the people were having a hard time there in Gwangju they still helped each other, taxi drivers helped the ones who's injured even if it means that they'll get killed by soldiers if they are seen taking the injured people to the hospital, doctors tried to save the people who were shot and harmed. 
If Mr. Kim, Hinzpeter, the taxi drivers, and the reporters weren't there...people wouldn't have known the truth about what's happening in Gwangju. It's sad that Hinzpeter wants to see Mr. Kim again but they never got the chance as Mr. Kim died before the reporter, Hinzpeter.|, This is a very, very good film. Unfortunately, many people here in Germany don't know about this history and the great work that Jürgen Hinzpeter did.|, Such an amazing movie. Just watched it today. Loved it
I literally didn't believe the fact that it is based on a true story 
Those people were so brutal
Not going to write anymore because I don't want to spoil it for others 
But it was one awesome movie, worth wasting money and time on it"
A United Kingdom,A United Kingdom Official International Trailer 1 (2016) - David Oyelowo Movie,pX5vI4osR50,3262791,32942,2555,"My country is celebrating 50years of independence this year because of Sir Seretse Khama, I am grateful for the choices he made because he gave us our independence. For the rest of the world this is just a story, for Botswana this depicts our history. You may hate the relationship its your given right to feel that way nor will I crucify you for it and i will praise the man and lady that gave us our independence.|, When he said ""but I love my wife"", I got goosebumps.|, I am quite happy to see this story being told. It is quite an inspirational one and one that I wish had been told far sooner. Sir Seretse and Ruth Khama are a symbol over how people can look beyond skin colour and find love and humanity in people they had been taught to see as each other as an ""other"" over such stupid parameters. It's an inspiration that we can have as a society in the USA, Canada, the UK and across the world as a whole. I'd highly also suggest that people visit Botswana, which is an amazing country with an amazing people. 

That said, I'm still cringing at the historical butchery present in the film when you know that the reason they were exiled was due to the apartheid South African government and not due to ""Hahaha we need to keep the Empire!"".|, Beautiful film. Fantastic cast. I loved it. Both were two inspirational, amazing souls we can learn a lot from. Botswana 🇧🇼 is such a beautiful country with stunning natural beauty, amazing wildlife and kind, friendly people. As a Zimbabwean 🇿🇼 from next door, I send my love, best wishes and kind thoughts to Botswana. 💛💚🇿🇼🍻🇧🇼 Proud to see my homeland of Southern Africa being put on the international screen.|, Watched this film today. Absolutely loved it. Felt so ashamed to be British but loved how this couple managed to fight it and do the right thing. I am sick and tired of people today still not agreeing with interracial marriage. I think it is beautiful. And at the end of the day, we humans are dust. White and black will return to the ground. Let's stop this hate and realise that we are all humans who can work together for good, regardless of ethnicity!|, This hero was the only African president who ruled his newly independent country under strictly democratic rules: no sole party, no dictatorship, no authoritarianism, no repression of political opposition, no violence. From 1966 to nowadays, in Botswana, a parliamentary democracy, free elections, respect to Human Rights, rule of law, good governance and stability prevail. Virtually no other African country can match that.|, Wonderful to see Sereste Khamas story being told! Botswana is such a wonderful country which much to be proud of.|, Another movie coming out this Oscar season that looks excellent. David Oyelowo is an excellent actor, and I actually got a little choked up watching this. It looks like a movie based off the messages of how love knows no race, or culture, doing what you feel is right, and knowing how and what to make things work, even in the face of so many people opposing it. I am looking forward to seeing this.|, I'm looking forward to this. It looks like one hell of a story, and I love Rosamund Pike. I'm eager to see her in something after Gone Girl. I worship Gone Girl and have immense respect for her as an actress (she should have won the damn Oscar) so it will be cool to finally get to see her in another big role that's something completely different. It's pretty much impossible to unsee her as Amy, but I know she can do other things. :)|, Wait...I am really appalled with this comment section. Not that the majority contains very racist and insulting comments (like 99% of youtube videos). But that this film was based on an ACTUAL EVENT. Although, I know I am a history fanatic, but does NO ONE heard of the story about Seretse Khama? The film is based about the life of the future Botswana president in the 1940s who was living in the U.K at the time. Botswana at the time was under British rule and Khama belonged to one of the most powerful tribal family in the country. He was expected to return to Botswana and succeed his father as the chief of his family. Until, he met a British lady called Ruth Williams and which he makes a hard decision to marry her despite all other circumstances. This romance film rather depicts the struggle of Khama and Ruth their fight to be accepted by the people of Botswana and against racist political system of neighbouring countries such as South Africa at the time. The struggle was truly a magnificent story as the couple refused to become successor of the family's ""chief"" but instead created the newly independent country- Botswana and broke away from British rule. For many years, Khama and his wife have managed to boost Botswana's economic growth and stabilised any political tension. And to even to this day, Botswana remained one of Africa's most peaceful and richest countries as Khama's son- Ian Khama is the current president of the country, continuing the magnificent legacy of Sereste Khama. Before, people start call this film unoriginal or cliche, why not try spend a little time researching what the film is about? Thumbs up so people REALLY KNOW WHAT THIS FILM IS ABOUT!!"
A Walk Among the Tombstones,A Walk Among The Tombstones -  Official Trailer (HD),aTKBowDjMQg,2116627,2847,202,"A very underrated thriller in my opinion|, Another Liam Neeson film this year? Damn. I remember him way back in Star Wars I, 15 years later,  he's in tons of action movies in a year alone & he's a badass. I liked that he said he done this before, its like the movie straight up mentioned Taken.

I wouldn't be surprised if there's going to be some Liam Neeson film where he's pretty much a retired 007, and comes out of retirement for one more mission. I think he'd be a great James Bond.|, When Liam's on a phone, you know it's serious business.|, One of the best opening scenes in any movie.|, Very very very very good movie!

I had to watch in twice in two days and I rarely do that.  I laughed my head off both times!  The scenery was magnificent and it was so real that you feel they are not even acting.  Nick Nolte and Robert Redford were perfect in this role. I love the environmental messages put out.  Definitely an adult movie.|, I am almost finished listening to the audio book.  Absolutely enthralling! I love every bit of it, because it's not only an adventure, he wrote about SO much history pertaining to areas in and around the AT, plus scientific facts sprinkled here and there. I figured the movie would be quite different, but it still looks very good. I've enjoyed Robert Redford flicks since I watched Brubaker(filmed 20 minutes away from my home) in my younger days.|, Love this movie.  Friendship rekindled, an adventure, adversity, and just fun.  It's a man's story for sure and a damned good one.|, I loved the music score, the amazing scenery, the subtle suggestions about the environment dying around us (which it truly is) and 2 old men taking a last stab at life.|, This is a simple movie with great acting i must say...really recommend people to watch it if you haven't done so. A good film to me consist of good story plot, great acting, some comedy/humour and a moral of story/reflection for people to relate on to their life. This movie definitely have those.|, just read this book & excited to watch the film. it looks happy and hilarious, just like the book. grateful for people like bill bryson, willing to go out and do things even when it was hard & annoying.|, Saw the movie, it was great.  Critics are giving mixed reviews, but my family and, from what I could tell, the audience laughed through the whole thing.  Very enjoyable.  Just a fun, inspirational film.

And don't worry about naysayers telling you that Redford is much older than Bill Bryson was at the time of the hike.  This film is about sedentary folks getting off their butts and hitting the trail.  That's the message, and a wonderful one at that.

You'll maybe want to go hiking after seeing this.  I know I can hardly wait.|, An adventure comedy with Emma Thompson, Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. What more could you ask for? It's gonna be awesome :D|, This movie is great!  Nick nolte is hilarious and Redford is surprisingly very funny.  Great chemistry between them.|, As a youth this is very inspirational as it is also different, we age with skin not our hearts. Can't wait to see what else this movies got for us."
A Wrinkle in Time,A Wrinkle in Time Official US Trailer,UhZ56rcWwRQ,10799722,65106,9386,"I remember reading this book last year and it was one of the best books I've ever read, IT'S SO POWERFUL|, It’s a emotional movie if you’re young and you’ve lost a parent that you were close to.  It made me cry and other people around me when I went to see it in the theater.|, I know many people are saying this movie is terrible, but I thought the movie was absolutely BEAUTIFUL! And yes I've read the book and although not exactly like the book I thought this was a gorgeous interpretation of the book.|, I read this when I was a kid, and now that I'm older and have kids of my own, I am reading it again! I refuse to see the movie until I've finished the book! This looks amazing!|, This movie is awesome. The messages that are conveyed within the movie address self worth and bullying. When the character named Meg doubts herself and wishes to return as someone else the character played by Oprah Winfrey takes Meg by the  shoulders and says ""Do you know how many important events had to  happen in universe leading up to the creation of you."" Meg says ""I never really thought about it that way"". The acting by the children is awesome as well as those who are master's in their field and work side by side with the kids in this movie. I've read some of the comments and all I can say is that the majority of the comments are closed minded. Some comments were regarding so many races being forced into this movie. All I can see is a number of races working together in this movie to try and defeat the evil that they have encountered. Comments were made about Brie Lawson but last time I checked she wasn't in this movie. Just remember folks the kids that made this movie also read these comments and I found it really hard to find positive comments. Leo and Nickie and Precious had some nice comments as well as some others. I'm sure the kids would like that. Much love to all and stay open minded. Don't let the darkness in the world get you down.|, This movie was absolutely beautiful. Yall are saying its terrible but the message is that we need love in the world. The it symbolized the hate and even the negativity people deal with. Meg suffered from low self esteem , facing the it and realizing that she was fine with being herself is the self love part of it all. Everything was beautiful|, No movie can replace a book, so I highly recommend you read the book if you're planning on going to see this.  It's wonderful!|, One of my favorite novels from when I was a kid, I can't believe. Disney finally made it a movie 😍😍😍|, It's already been 3 YEARS? Man. I thank my teacher for reading us the book and ACTUALLY made us go on a fieldtrip to watch it 🥺|, Best movie I’ve seen in ages.  So spiritual with so many life lessons.   So much better than all the violence we see in most movies today.  A Wrinkle in Time was about love, facing our fears and not shutting our emotions off when things get tough.  Very touching.  You can feel it in your soul.  🙂👌❤️🙏"

Love when co-stars are in shows and movies together|, Just looks so weird when Adam and Amy aren't together in a show cause they are so perfect compared to Jessica and Adam |, This is so relatable. This movie is my life, and I loved Adam Scott and Amy Poehler in Parks and Recreation|,  A movie with Adam Scott AND Amy Poehler? Definitely watching.|, This actually looks better than i excepted.

About Time,About Time Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Rachel McAdams Movie HD,T7A810duHvw,16374951,80845,3878,"I don't know about you guys, but I was more moved by the father-son relationship more than the actual lead relationship. It caught me off guard, and it was so beautiful :)|, This is not the ordinary romantic movies. This movie was simply beautiful. I love how they didn't put a hot muscular guy to play this role. He was an average looking guy. Which I liked even more. I cried so much in the last scene with his dad. It was just so beautiful I can't even put it into words. I am very very glad I watched it. It just shows that every day we should stay positive and enjoy the little things because that is what truly makes us happy.|, This movie is fantastic because it actually depicts a loving, healthy relationship. With so many nicholas sparks movies trying to tell people love is wanting to die for your significant other, and having screaming matches with them before kissing them in the rain, it's beautiful to see a film that shows what real love actually is.|, This movie is not a romance film, cause it's much more than that. It's food for the soul, like reading a great book - one that stays with you for the rest of your life. ❤|, Totally amazed at how good this film actually was. Script was clever, acting brilliant, soundtrack awesome and directing top class. 6'4, built like a house yurt had tears in my eyes at the end. Totally absorbing film.|, What made everything about this film extraordinary, was how the characters are real people. Not in the literal sense of time travelling, but how a simple man had realizations with life and the persons he love are the ones that kept him waking up in the morning. We all have that one reason that keeps us getting up from bed, why and what are the things we live for. Love the film. 

I suddenly love smiling again to strangers. Everyday is a chance to start.|, This movie had an amazing impact on me. This is one of those movies that can literally change your life because the message is so powerful. Time is too precious to be negative and unappreciating. Just wow.|, I'm getting tears in my eyes just remembering this movie. Truly a piece of art. Beautiful and touching.|, I don't usually watch/like romantic films, but this has to be one of my favorite movies. The way it deals with our wishes/emotions is so spot on, and the scene where he's walking with his father on the beach is basically the only thing that makes me cry every time I watch it|, What makes it such a great movie is how it doesn’t follow the standard sequence all movies follow where there is something that changes the life of the protagonist, then a good period, then a really bad period, then happily ever after. This whole movie from start to finish was just happy. I’ve always looked for a movie like that and just found it. The sad parts were never drawn out and everything was addressed and moved on like real life. But the beautiful moments were just that. The happy parts were extraordinarily happy to a point where I was smiling the whole time. To me that’s what made it so great."

Afterwards, my mother took me to Showbiz Pizza Place for lunch. It was bizzare being serenaded with this song by the Rock-afire Explosion Band in an otherwise empty pizza parlor/arcade. I still remember the gorilla on the keyboards just jamming away while in the background the arcade machines did their thing.|, This song is a classic. I still listen to it in 2020. It doesn't get old|, As a bassist, any song that is driven by the bass, which this one is, is a blast to play.|, This was my jam in my youthful days and now at 50 I still love this❤|, Вот только это-- Оригинал!!!

Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie,Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie | Official HD Trailer #1 | 2016,Dj3ZWhlmexw,3361812,12726,909,"I'll say it, this movie truly looks Absolutely Fabulous. Can't wait!|, I don't even care if it turns out crap, I know that I'll still love it|, A série era muito boa na época, não perdia um !!!|, What an amazing film! Jennifer Saunders masterly manages to portray a clown's tragedy which is, actually, an art! Very few are able to do it. All the hit lines from the sitcom are here along with the fresh ones, considering the fact the world has changed a little. I enjoyed every every tiny little second of this Movie. Everything is here: the acting, the fashion, the outfits, the music, the fab and sad, the rich and poor... You'll definitely fall for Edina Monsoon and her best friend Patsy Stone again.|, Can't wait to see this! Was a huge fan of the show; kept me laughing the whole time! I love these two . .|, Cannot wait to see this film.  Looks funnier than ever and they don't look any older than when the series was running.  Love Joanna Lumley in everything she does.  Absolutely fabulous lives on. x|, I remember watching the TV series. Absolutely loved it.|, Looks absolutely amazing and fun, can't wait to see it!! :)|, Just watched it! It was absolutely fabulous. Super funny and just like the TV show|, BRILLIANT!... All these years and they still look ""ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS""!!!"
Acrimony,Tyler Perry’s Acrimony (2018 Movie) Official Trailer – Taraji P. Henson,wlpunOUxYSo,6532892,39655,3880,"How does Taraji NOT have an Oscar?!!!!!!!!!!!! She needs to be awarded already!!!!!!|, This movie honestly got to me. It was so heartbreaking for her. The ending made me so angry I was pissed for the rest of the day lmfaoo. But it made me so mad because I felt what she felt before. It’s very heartbreaking. It’s a feeling where you feel like you never can win in life she never got a break. Everything in life was very unfair to her. Sad at the end she never got what she wanted. This movie gives u a life lesson to never make SOMEONE ELSE your top priority. Be happy with yourself before you make someone else happy.|, Taraji Is the best African American crazy actress no one could’ve ever play a part better then her💯|, Ok so I recently watched this and I have to say it's amazing. Don't judge a book by its cover. I thought this would be a typical story but the story she tells of how it all happened is.... Angering. It makes you feel what she felt on a sort of level and the way she turns crazy is different than other stories in my opinion. Just give it a try and you won't regret it.|, This is what happens when you make everything in your life about your significant other. Never lose sight of self.|, I love this movie so much. I loved how you could just feel the intensity of every scene in this film. Neither of the characters were completely right or wrong in their actions but a lot of it felt justified even if unreasonable with both parties. You don’t get too many of these movies nowadays with most having the obviously villian.|, A story about a woman who allows destructive emotions to drive her literally insane. Art imitating life; Indeed. There are women/men out there who can't handle moving on. Their lives are forever attached to that person. The movie had a huge message. So no, it's not one of those predictable stories about cheating. It drives DEEPER. Yes, I would see it again.|, This is a great movie. I’ve read so many bad reviews but this movie has so much emotion that most people don’t understand. There are people who have been in the same predicament and tbh I don’t think people will ever understand this movie if they have not experienced something so devastating and life changing. As I have|, Just watched this movie 2 days ago & all I can say is wow! I had goosebumps the whole time for the simple fact that I could relate to her rage in so many ways, If you're like her or somewhat similar I promise you it will make you think deep, this movie definitely carries a STRONG message & not just one but multiple. this movie is the perfect example of being driven by your emotions. The Judge didn't care about all those years she wasted, he didn't make a decision based on what she testified. In the process of living for her man she lost herself & the more she gave the harder it became for her to restrain.|, I knew I was crazy when I watched this and saw nothing wrong in her actions 😂"
Action Point,Action Point (2018) - Official Trailer - Paramount Pictures,ri1Cc3Yz09U,7505991,38538,2367,"This is in my opinion a very underrated comedy
Very relatable and it’s cool to see Johnny noxvhile as the owner of action point 

As someone who has interest in action park this film resonated with me 
It’s actually one of the better films released in the 2010s 

Yes I liked a raunchy comedy better than an excuse to utilize memberberries to manipulate the audience cough Disney live action remakes cough|, This is the kind of movie that critics will hate, but you’ll love if you’re into people getting hurt.

I recommend:)|, Cool to see Knoxville in a film where he does his own ridiculous stunts and tells a heartfelt story at the same time|, 5/10 on imdb. Should been rated 8. One of the best comedy movies i have seen. It’s easy to make someone cry it’s hard to make a person laugh!|, Johnny is 47 y/o and he still does all his own stuns, getting tossed around like a tennis ball... crazy bastard|, Poo poo on all the critics who thumbs downed Action Point. Just finished watching it. We loved it. This is one we will definitely rewatch throughout the years. The script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography was all excellent. And, sweet Jesus, there are so many killer stunts.  This movie’s following will grow. A perfect family movie for grown up anarchists.|, Jackass and Viva La Bam were my childhood shows. It always feels nice to see Knoxville and the crew still doing new stuff together!|, Hell yeah! This movie looks great. Glad some of the guys (I didn't see everyone) are back doing stunts. These guys are legends! 🤘🏼|, Knoxville’s laugh, the one we all know and miss. You can tell none of them were fake so that’s how you know it’s gonna be a great movie.|, I honestly don’t get the hate behind this movie. It’s not brilliant but it had heart, good story and funny moments. Truly underrated"
Ad Astra,Ad Astra | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,P6AaSMfXHbA,10910853,45480,3077,"Just finished watching Ad Astra, what a fantastic movie that was. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews. It's not the space movie I thought it would be, it was better. Not a ton of action but a fantastic psychological and emotional story that was very well acted. This film will eventually get the attention it deserves.|, Just finished the film, and I definitely say wow to say the least. I was captivated from pretty much start to finish. I feel like it could speak to somebody like me on a deeper sense, which I feel like it did. The visuals, settings, the whole theme was very intriguing. I definitely respect the originality of the film. Definitely underrated, and was a badass film. It's one for a continual film page. Bravo Mr. Pitt and anyone else involved with the film!|, The beauty of this film is something else. The main character Roy doesn’t realize he’s just like his father obsessing over the unknown, obsessing over something he couldn’t see when he should be accepting that whats important is what you have right now in this moment, what made you feel alive, the unknown is the unknown, our future is unknown, what we do there is unknown. Obsession is what blinds you to see the beauty of what is known, that you have a life and you have a home and it’s the thing we can’t lose. Our trauma, our work, our obsessions they all pull us from what’s really right there in front of us the things that’s there to give us life.|, Such an underrated movie. I watched it today and to be honest….out of many sci-fi movies….this is the only movie that has taken me to the “edge of our” solar system. So simple yet so beautiful…|, The same cinematographer behind Interstellar, Let the Right One In, and Dunkirk? Visually, this is going to be fantastic. Can’t wait.|, Very well done film, very well thought out plot, very well acting, cinematography, music, and just about everything else. 
     I've read so many comments of people bashing this movie for being ""boring,"" and for the movie lasting two hours and ""absolutely nothing happening."" < These were the people looking for an action packed/ interstellar esc emotionally compelling movie. This movie is gonna be praised by intellectually advanced film critics, but called boring by young boys looking for another star wars.. 
    >Also I thought the ending was outstanding ! His father's will was gazed upon the stars, while he missed what was right in front of his face. ""We are all we need!!"" 10/10|, This is a serverely underrated movie. It was one of the most unexpectedly beautiful films I ever saw in my life.|, Brad Pitt + an astronaut film. I'm there opening day. It's just great how Pitt continues to star in interesting films year after year. The man is a workhorse and a brilliant actor. Long may he continue.|, Loved the movie tbh, the ending was so cool, loved the twist or lack there of, it’s just a father and son story, and the sound of silence in the universe|, It blows my mind this isn't talked about in the same breath of interstellar and the martian. This film was absolutely incredible with a very powerful message."

It was so emotive and the realism hits the heart-strings. I imagine portraying a real life persons trauma is a lot more pressure but Shailene nailed it and as for the real lady-wow what a strong woman! Great film x|, I hope this movie showcases more of Shailene’s acting ability. I’m tired of people judging her just because she was in a young adult franchise|, Ticks all the boxes of what a great film should be. Long takes, great love story without getting cheesy, a fully earned plot twist, and the score is just amazing.|, This movie was amazing. It looked so real unlike many other ocean movies that look ridiculous. I was actually getting sea sick. WOW Beautiful movie about survival, love, and the power of nature. A must see.|, I watched this movie today and the ending just broke me, I  have never cried so much in a theatre that I had to leave.|, A wonderful movie. I am lucky I ve never heard about the real story before. Enjoyed it drastically 😭❤️❤️|, Legit just finished this movie a few mins ago. And it was so amazing. I cried so much but i loved it. ❤|, Ugh just finished this movie.. Kept me invested the whole way through & ofc i cried at the end. The plot twist had my jaw on the ground. I cant imagine going through this. Definitely a good watch.|, I couldn’t stop crying, this is such a tragic story and this movie portrayed it so well.|, Was late to this, but I recently watched it. This is an amazing movie, performed by two amazing leading actors! I say give this movie a go! Was such a beautiful, yet unexpected plot twist."

I was fully entertained by it-the cast did a fine job as well. =)|, Always cool to see comedians like Nick Kroll stretch their legs into drama, even when it looks like a middling genre exercise that recycles every trope in the indie-dramedy book. I blame the Duplass brothers.|, Bobby Cannavale is sure getting typecast as the husband character. Thank God for Vinyl.|, This movie was great!|, You had me at rose byrne !!!|, I'll watch this just because of Nick Kroll.....even if IMDB gave it a 5 :((|, O my! tHis is where it all begins...again~|, Rose is hot everywhere she plays.

The first part you have to kinda sit through but then it gets really good.|, for me the best found footage movie in history. the acting is really natural and authentic and the camera is very well. because of the static cams ( from cliff) you dont have so many ""hectic- bouncy - pls dont get on my nerves"" scenes. I wished the whole time the moovie wouldnt end.
people who liked chonicle will love afflicted.|, I must say, it's hard to find any modern good and original horror found footage films nowadays.

I love this movie 10/10!|, this is a gem...watched again recently and it still has me on the edge of my seat , very cool and creepy movie|, Saw this movie recently, it's really good.

After Death,After Death | Official Trailer 2 | Angel Studios,Tl4sIZkTZU0,1809075,5836,364,"Thank you for this. My mom experienced this and told the doctor word for word what he said and did as he was trying to save her. She also said Jesus came to her and told her it wasn't her time. She had much to do. Almost 2 decades later, she saved my children. At the time, no one believed her.|, My wife and I saw this movie on opening day. She cried quite a bit because her parents died recently. There were several stories that were especially shocking. Definitely worth seeing.|, This movie was beautifully orchestrated and presented. Praise God!|, Since the sudden and completely unexpected death of my 35 yr old son Karl in October of 2021 my entire thought process on beliefs, religion, and the afterlife is so wide open. I’ve actually been able to capture pretty incredible things on my ring cam.  Most important thing for me and my family is that it brings comfort and peace knowing theres more to this all.|, My father died in his 30s for about 5 minutes.  His great grandmother told him it was not his time and he had to come back.  He finally went home at the age of 55 which is my current age.  He was different when he came back.  He made an extremely positive impact on many young men as a baseball coach after that including me of course.  When he did finally pass, so many of them came to me and told me how much they loved him.
No one should fear death.  My fear is the pain felt by my loved ones when I return home.  They know where we are going but human emotions will still take over as they do for me when I have lost loved ones.|, My aunt suffered a heart attack and her heart stopped for 25 minutes. They revived her. She died again on the way to the hospital for 20 minutes. She was in a coma for 5 months and when she woke up she said she saw herself outside her house, watching while the paramedics worked on her. My grandma (who had died the year before) was with her and kept telling her to get back inside her house. She said she remembers feeling so happy and didn’t want to come back. She had to learn to walk and talk again since she lost a lot of oxygen both times she passed away but she’s getting there day by day.|, This movie was actually pretty amazing!! Very well put together and had me from the 1st min to the end|, I watched it last weekend and IT'S A MUST SEE!!! I'm actually going again with more friends this Friday!!! 🙏🏻🙌🏻❤️

My friend and I just need it to find a movie that wasn't a typical horror film on holloweeen weekend, to take one of our friends to since she was visiting and we all needed a break, so this one came up. I didn't really know what it was about exactly, I didn't watch the trailer prior to. I'm a Christian and all I can say is YES!!! YES!!! YES!!! THE BEST IS YET TO COME POEPLES!!! GOD IS AWESOME!!! AMEN AND AMEN!!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️|, My family and i were lucky enough to see this on opening day, not many people in the theater though.
this is truly a movie that deserves a 10/10, brought me to tears more than i want to admit.|, I can’t wait to see this movie. This movie is going to bring hope to so many people I think."
After Earth,After Earth Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Will Smith Movie HD,CZIt20emgLY,19264988,55585,10725,"Loved this movie. Impacted me when I was learning about the ego and fear being an illusion. It didnt bother me that Will was just guiding him I thought that was cool. Seeing Jaden face threatening beasts and adapting was way better than most films that dont dive to deep into that. Felt like a video game. One of the few movies I'll rewatch again.|, It's a great movie. First time I watched it I didn't like it I think because it was different to what I expected (maybe since I watched pursuit of happiness). Honestly I felt it one of the best movie ever after  watching it again during this pandemic|, I loved this movie! It has such an interesting plot, i must admit, it could have went into bigger obstacles and went onto more challenging ones, also, i have hoped that Jaden in that character would have not been so afraid, but it's satisfying to see him grow until the end when he faced that monster. Either way! I loved the last airbender too!! I don't know why you do not like it, but i do lol. definitely will watch again :)|, “ Your going to have to lay there, for a little bit “ 😭😭😭😭 My Heart as a father man I Love this Movie here in 2023|, I really don't understand all the hate about this movie. It's a lesson of life, I love it and I really learned something from it|, So glad I watched this movie before reading rotten tomatoes reviews and comments here. My kids and I watched this morning and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It had valuable prinicples and life lessons, particularly that danger is real; but fear of danger is an option. Fear can stifle our innermost abilities that would normally flourish when not masked beneath the illusion of fear. A.E. was entertaining and adventurous. And I think both Will and Jayden played their roles damn well. I am now wondering how many good movies I've tainted the opportunity to enjoy based on the strong unison of the opinionated yet easily influenced masses.|, Just went to the cinema and watched this its so good I jumped so many times and it even brought a tear to my eye!|, I really just liked the lesson about fear, and accepting things the way they are. If the science didn't make sense or match up, who gives a damn it was a thrilling, interesting movie with a good lesson- like most Will Smith movies. |, I love this movie. I know people hate on it, but I enjoy it.  It’s a little gem.|, probably one of my fav will smith movies, with his son, zoe kravitz (just adore her), a nice adventure tale, well balanced script and direction, good editing , and the fact that will tapped into the ""the boy is intuitive"" after coms go fubar, i would even dare to say this,
 will become a modern classic movie in a few years... 
because of its simplicity and good taste, a solid movie."

I know what's coming and I am still gonna be crying in the theater like a baby|, Screaming, crying and laughing at the same time. I’ve waited so long for this movie. I’ve reread all the books and rewatched the movies more than once. Love all about it and I’m soooo excited. I already know that I’m going to cry in the theater, even if I’ve already read the books and know what’s going to happen.|, Watching them in sequence made more sense in their journey. I never read the novel but the films themselves already revealed to me how original and captivating this series and story is (especially if you can relate to the characters). The series portrays negative aspects of a toxic relationship, which makes it so unique and original because in real life, relationships are not always perfect but you can tell Hardin genuinely loves Tessa. To me, this film series is not simply about an on and off relationship. Re-watching them really hit me in some way. Even though Hardin and Tessa do not know each other for that long, the films made it feel like they really grew in their relationship and just watching their journey is so great. I look forward to watching “After Everything” as well as reading the book. Although they are fictional characters, the films make Hardin and Tessa feel realistic. I wish to see more of Hardin and Tessa in the future. There is just so much detail in their relationship and even though the last film has been released, they deserve more screen time and we as audiences deserve to see more of their ongoing journey <3|, I'm bawling already just from watching but I think it's cause the end is near. I never thought I would grow so emotionally attached to a film like I have. I have never fell so much in love with a film couple before like I have with them. 😢 ❤|, Perfect example of a trauma bond and red flags to avoid while dating. Seriously this whole movie series is just a PSA for abusive and manipulative relationships.|, I never thought that the last After movie could appear as interesting as it does here... It seems that the subject of the hardships of their love has finally been seriously treated!

Makes me want to see it...|, I just love this story and this couple, never had such an experience wanting to see more of them. This story is breath taking and yes...got me hook. Best story ever!!|, I'm not ready to be heartbroken again, I want them together forever|, Whatever our souls are made of, hers and mine are the same|, I’m a huge fan of the After films, I cannot wait for the next one to come out, the trailer looks epic. ❤️ at this point I feel like I know Hardin and Tessa so well.

When Tessa said there is no your Tessa anymore I cried

They apparently remained closer to the book and the cast is even better 😊🔥. 
I am sooo exited 😍|, So like— basically Tessa and Hardin switched roles..... She turned into a girl who’s kisses every guy she meets on the streets and he turned to “I only love you.”|, This went from cute teen movie to 50 shades of grey reaal quick|, the fact that dylan sprouse is in this makes it 100x better|, I love the after series and stuff but if they made a 5 hour movie with all the details from the after we collided novel, I would 100% watch it.|, for anyone who’s a fan of this series - please read the book because it’s so much better than the way it’s depicted in the movie. im not a fan of this movie at all but i will be tuning in just to see it acted on film"
After We Fell,After We Fell | Official Trailer | Prime Video,3OHPCurXcTU,4511303,58592,1006,"Who's excited to see Tessa & Hardin back on our screens?|, I honestly love Tessa and Hardin together, yeah I know their relationship is toxic but relationships can't be perfect even when we think someone deserves better. If Tessa felt that Hardin was too difficult for her to handle she would have long left and thus goes to Hardin too. They have sticked with each other throughout their most difficult times and to me that's okay. 
I love Tessa and Hardin and I wish they never break up. But that's just my perspective of the movie. You have yours.|, See, these movies are far from great but they're addictive and I can't help but say I'm excited and I can't wait to watch this!

Same goes for the books, not great but I struggle to put them down|, literally 100% of their problems would be solved if they just broke up|, Much more excited for Dylan is in trouble, Alex myers, and Aaron and jo to roast it 😍😍|, Maturity is when you realise after movies are showing toxic and abusive relationship.|, Turn this into a series or something, we are here for it✨|, All ""after"" movies are so amazing,I love when a movie makes me laugh and cry at the same time.. 😊😊😊|, So sad that not all in the books came to life in this movie. I just love After series so much! I watched it but then again, I read the book all over again.|, At this point I just feel embarrassed for having read the books years ago ... what was I thinking gosh"
After Yang,After Yang | Official Trailer HD | A24,Kwp32zLc08c,1385431,23881,909,"Saw this at Sundance and it stole the show for me. It’s a beautiful film both visually and philosophically that is a hypnotizing meditation on the human experience. It’s the kind of film that will resonate with you long after you watch it. Very reminiscent of Terrance Malick’s Tree of Life, but through a more sci-fi lense. Go see it when you get the chance!|, A24 does not disappoint. It's great to see a film marketing company  that puts quality of product first.|, Loved this movie. It feels a bit distant at first but it grows on you and becomes pretty emotionally profound by the end in a way that made me think of Arrival or Her. Kogonada really takes a different approach to AI here- serene, curious and nonjudgmental in a way that sets it apart from any other film I’ve seen that explores the subject. Can’t wait to watch it again and peel back the layers even further|, Glad that Colin is taking films that showcase what he can do. Dude has always be such a great talent.|, Production design on this was so beautiful, so soothing. I loved this almost minimalist take on futuristic design. And a very poignant story as well. A24 level of quality!|, Such a one of kind movie. Calm and silent, no forcing to have any emotions but make you feel tons…|, É uma pena enorme eu não ver ngm falando desse filme. Achei ele graças ao pinterest e ele me tocou de uma forma INEXPLICÁVEL ❤️|, This film definitely feels influenced by the likes of Tarkovsky and Malick, although it comes off as far less meandering than the works of the latter. I appreciate how deliberate and contemplative the film is, and just lets each frame breathe as long as it needs to.|, Columbus is one of my all-time favorite films. I cannot express how ecstatic I am to experience After Yang.|, Since I don’t see any comments mentioning this, this is based on the short story “saying goodbye to mr. Yang” it’s honestly really enjoyable for only being a few pages and worth a read. The movie obviously will be an original work that goes further than the original story."
After the Ball,After the Ball Official Trailer 1 (2015) - Chris Noth Comedy HD,Dze8Cmr9sns,2466123,11234,211,"I just watched this movie and I think it's actually pretty entertaining and cute! Sure, it's cheesy, but you'll think it's great when it's 1AM and you're feeling all the feels.|, This was such an utterly wonderful movie! Just finished watching it and simply adored it! |, I actually really enjoyed this movie- yes the storyline is predictable but the acting and characters are great. The girl-as-boy slip-ups aren't dragged out and super awkward and Nate feels like an actual separate person rather than an obvious disguise. Also a lot of funny and super cute scenes.|, Loved this movie when I was younger. Watched it over and over. Turns out I'm trans. Rewatching it for the first time in years and realizing that I totally stole Nate's style lmao! 😂|, Surprisingly I really enjoyed this movie. Most Hallmark movies are hard to get through once, but I've watched this at least 3 times now. The main character is very like-able, and this movie has some good acting in it. (Some. Not all.) Plus it's got Mr. Big.|, This is one of my fave Cinderella stories next to RAGS and disney's live action version. I love how they kept the dad alive but is an absentee father. I love that her prince charming isn't a gorgeous white knight. Instead she's the savior of her father's company. I love the play with words 'KASSELL' as in castle. She's the princess and the prince is a pauper. I especially loved the fashions. Costume designer Mario Davignon collaborated with clothing retailer Le Château to produce a clothing line based on his designs for the film.|, It's a cute movie...I enjoyed it! It was a happy bit of entertainment with a great wardrobe.  Definately worth a watch if you want to tune out for a bit.|, It's just cute flick for the times when you're too out of tasks :) Just watched it, entertaining enough. At least better than Mondays.|, It's actually pretty good... kind of well done and polished.|, I watched it today.And it was actually pretty good.
Cute movie."

It feels like you want to feel like everything is fine, but deep down your terrified because of what happened.|, This music is not a song... It's an emotion|, I've been a fan of this song for YEARS and I didnt have a YouTube account but now i do I can say... 
This song has a lot of emotion's, and I personally LOVE this song! Keep up the work|, <|°_°|> 
Es hermoso|, This song is what dissociating feels like. The pausing and then, continuation, repetition, etc of the song and beat is like losing memory of what happened and then just going on with your day. The repetition is when you try to remember but keep returning to the present moment because you can't remember anything before it. It also feels like when you remember why you dissociated. Just quickly flipping back to something normal if it's too much for your mind to just let it sit.|, gotta give the animation meme community credit, their taste in music slaps|, everyone uses this song for creepy videos but the song itself is proven to be a vibe.

Edit: <|°_°|>|, This song has a very strange vibe for me
It gives me a feeling, that everything is okay, but in few seconds everything good is going to be destroyed"
Aftersun,Aftersun | Official Trailer HD | A24,G9jOaggGPKQ,1253363,9055,432,"Cried harder at the end of this film than any I've seen in recent memory. Those last 10 minutes just destroyed me. Beautiful film.|, Call me crazy but I’ve seen this movie five times, and probably will see it once or twice more before it leaves theaters. I’m addicted to how vulnerable and emotional it makes me feel. If Charlotte Wells keeps telling these types of stories, she’ll become one of my favorite directors.|, Saw this at TIFF. A quietly profound movie that has so much to say about love and memory. And it was only after the credits rolled that I realized how richly layered this film is. What an awe-inspiring directorial debut.|, This movie was so cryptic, haunting and mysterious- but by the end I was emotionally floored and wanted to rewatch it all over again to try and dissect what everything meant. Reminded me a bit of a Jane Campion film in how it leaves behind tiny breadcrumbs of rich suggestive detail as to what the characters are feeling, without explicitly spelling anything out. A quietly profound and shattering piece of work|, This was the best movie I saw at Telluride. It honestly blew me away. Very subtle and very delicate. I was reminded of In the Mood for Love, Tree of Life, and Moonlight. Charlotte Wells is a talent.|, This is easily one of the best movies i have seen in the last decade. And i dont think i have EVER seen better on screen chemistry than the chemistry these two have. I read that they took a ""practice vacation"" before filming to help build the chemistry and clearly it paid off.|, Thank you to all that made this for giving us this film I will cherish forever. A bittersweet quiet goliath of a film that beat out every other movie last year for me|, Beautiful film. So many things about Paul's character reminded me of my childhood with my own dad, who we lost last year (right down to embarrassing us by doing Tai Chi in public lol). Leaves you with that hazy, melancholy feeling of waking up from a dream you can't quite remember..|, This film kept me on edge with dread and fear as the entire storyline was building up for a big reveal. It's a heavy emotional and deeply layered movie. I'll have to see it again because I was left puzzled after the first watch. Phenomenal film. 10/10.|, I've been dying to see this and am happy to finally get some trailer footage. Honestly looks amazing and Barry Jenkins producing this has me even more pumped."
Air,AIR | Official Trailer,Euy4Yu6B3nU,14142212,43324,2805,"This movie was absolutely amazing! Its really a story about persevering, risk taking, and instinct. Oh, and a little good luck. The speech Matt Damon gives when they finally meet with the Jordans is right up there with Al Pacino in Any Given Sunday.|, MJ had 2 numbers in his career, 45 and 23. AIR was released 4/5/23. I saw the movie today and it's been a while since I felt this good leaving a theater. I've been thinking about it all day and it's made me feel more uplifted. I also didn't expect such an amazing soundtrack, probably one of my favorites of all time. They even have Tangerine Dream who composed a lot of 80's soundtracks. The movie opens with a montage of 1984 including Ghostbusters and Beverly Hills Cop clips while 'Money For Nothing' by Dire Straits plays. 
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon work great together like always, and Ben wanted Chris Tucker to play Howard White who Chris happened to know. So Ben basically let Chris write his own role because they believe in working in a friendly environment where everyone cooperates, and it certainly shows in this movie. This movie's acting, directing, and soundtrack was so good I'm thinking of seeing it again this week.|, That's going to be an absolutely amazing movie. What I'm enjoying even more is how Ben is becoming a legendary director right in front of us.|, I've watched AIR three times already, and I love it so much. Viola Davis as MJ's mom is a role model for all mothers, inspiring the strength we will need to try to live up to in order to face our country's problems. Even though MJ's mom is clearly a private person, it would have been nice to hear more of her story, for sure. I loved the male friendships in AIR because the team has intense disagreements but continues to support each other. There are so many beautiful monologues delivered perfectly, not only by Matt Damon but the supporting roles, too, as they try to take the right actions both for themselves and their team.    The humorous push and pull fight scenes between Falk and Vaccaro are laugh-out-loud hilarious! We watch the verbal sparring between basketball players, coaches, referees and other players, but we don't realize this happens with agents and recruiters for company sponsors. The storytelling in AIR is really suspenseful. The many obstacles Vaccaro must overcome are played out with good timing by expert actors. Even though you know the ending, you don't know when and how the news will arrive, so they figured out a way to use suspension of disbelief and tension, so a known story keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's such a beautiful, moving story with terrific actors and great writing.|, As a kid growing up in Chicago in the 90s, this made me a little emotional.  There’s no one like MJ.  I’m soooo excited for this ❤|, Just finished watching ""AIR"" on Amazon Prime.  I absolutely  loved it, and since i was 20 in 1980, the abundance of older pop culture images and sound-bytes brought to me much pleasure, as it was delivered so nice.  Awesome cast.  No one needs to be a die-hard sports fan to enjoy this storyline of great American history in business.   Beyond Matt, Ben,  and Jason; quite interesting to see Wayans in a somewhat serious role.  Was only disappointed once:   When the negotiation began on the % of sales,  it seems Mom vaguely stated  one number over the phone,  but later when Matt went to Ben, and Matt received Ben's approval, it seemed so unrealistic that numbers were never spoken.  And more unreal when Matt called the mom back, the absence of a numeric percentage.  Don't want to close on a negative note - thank you guys for this wonderful feel-good movie!|, The trailer was awesome. Ben Affleck never disappoints as a director ❤️|, Wow, what an amazing line: ""A shoe is just a shoe.. until my son steps into it."" That's powerful.|, Great documentary/movie. Anyone who grew up in the 80’s will appreciate the soundtrack and all the 80’s references as well. It’s like a flash back.|, How did they have a trailer about Air Jordans and pursing MJ without ever showing Michael Jordan himself or even an actor playing him. Simply brillant. It's clearly about the journey it took to land him. I'm all in."

I wasn't so much concerned with the actor as I was the story, but this looks phenomenal. Tyler Perry is a great actor and can play all types of roles, so I have no doubt he's going to knock this out of the park when I see it in theatres! =)|, I just saw this yesterday; the cinematic equivalent of a blind date.  The psychopath in this film was my favourite character, and a fair bit of fun.  Kudos to Matthew Fox for the performance. :D|, I've always loved this character, and I've always loved Tyler Perry. He is by far one of the most talented actors, directors, producers out there today and he will make this movie great. The entire cast is going to make it one of the rare movies I will go to the movies to see. Can't wait. 
|, I am such a huge fan of James Patterson's novels, especially those about Alex Cross. I can't wait to see this. I loved Morgan Freeman as Cross back in the day (Along Came a Spider, Kiss the Girls); but this story centers on a young Alex's life. If you're a true fan, you already know what the ending is, which i will not give here. Tyler perry looks like he'll kill this one. I was a bit skeptical at frist when I heard Tyler would be playing Alex, but I think he nails it. ♥ Alex Cross.|, Oh my god I can't wait for this. It is one of the best detective novels I have ever read. The Butcher is one of the creepiest nastiest most twisted villains ever. I haven't ever really seen Tyler Perry in anything, but I want to give this movie a chance just because Alex Cross is my second favorite detective in all drama fiction (beaten by Olivia Benson).|, Looks like another great movie from one of my favorite authors.  I loved Morgan Freeman so it may take a bit to adapt to Tyler Perry as ""Alex"", but the trailer sure looks like he can handle the job.  Can't wait to see the movie!|, So excited to see this new Alex Cross! I was totally disappointed when Morgan Freeman was cast in the original Cross movies; it just wasn't anything like I had imagined Alex Cross to look like in my mind while reading the books. But Tyler Perry? After just seeing the preview, he has already blown my mind for what Alex Cross should look like and how he should act. I CAN'T WAIT|, Can't wait! I love the Alex Cross series :') |, WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS GREAT. THERE WAS ACTUALLY PEOPLE CRYING DURING ONE SCENE.  TWO THUMBS UP FOR SURE."

2. Hatter's innocent yet witty lines. (Well, if I'm not I wish I was! *cue cute grin*; I'll meet you when you're younger and I'm older... *puzzled look*; Makes perfect ""thenth"" to me! Alice, you seem to have time all mixed up.)
3. Hatter (and Alice) look SO colorful. He looks so young, innocent, and untraumatized. His hair looks tamer.... and fluffy.
4. Hatter introduces himself as Tarrant! Which means Alice may address him as such! SQUEE!

Admittedly, I'm just anticipating some more chemistry between Hatter and Alice... it was very subtle last time! But I'm sure the plot will be good, too. Cannot wait to see it. Anyone know when it comes out on DVD?|, WE NEED JOHNNY BACK IN MOVIES, Please!! He is such a brilliant actor!"

Not everyone is lucky to get out before it's too late.|, It really does show the anxiety of being in an abusive relationship. How they control, take away friendships and family, and how feeling like leaving is impossible. This is going to be such a good film. I am happy that I am at a place and point in my life, where I can watch this and not be to triggered by it. I hope no one else is triggered by this as well. 🙏🏼🫶🏼 Abuse takes a lifetime of unlearning and of healing. 💗💗|, It’s so important that these kinds of relationships get talked about in this medium so that more awareness can be spread about it.|, Alice's intellectualisation of her partner's abusive controlling behaviour to her friends and herself is spot on.|, This is going to be so triggering for countless women who have had a relationship like this and found their way out. They really portray the mind games of it all so well. Including how your own mind will turn on you and make you crazy because the person telling you they love you more than anything and they are all you have is simultaneously destroying you. I will say that every woman in this situation MUST have strong friends, family, etc., to be there for her no matter what. No yelling at her how this is crazy, and she is blind, etc. Stable support and help to get a way out. Even if it takes 500 tries. One of the 500 can save her life and give her a chance against permanent CPTSD.|, I saw this at TIFF and it really moved me with the way it feels deeply real, not some depiction of how we think victims should behave or how we think these relationships should escalate and extinguish themselves. There were many times watching that I felt just as unsure of what Alice should do as Alice felt.|, I was lucky enough to have gotten out of an incredibly abusive marriage with someone  controlling, manipulative, deceitful, violent, abusive and obsessive. This video made me truly shudder. I got out by the grace of God. As many have said many don't usually get out of a relationship like this. I was fortunate enough to have remarried a truly wonderful man and today is our 32nd wedding Anniversary. I did not get out unscathed. Was definitely damaged goods and had a baby girl. There is light at the end of the tunnel for anyone trying to get out. If it's safe please get a plan in place and leave. There is nothing like getting your life back and experiencing freedom. Not sure if I will be able to watch this movie & I love Anna K. but too much ptsd. 💜|, Every time he kept saying, “My beautiful girl”, I got chills. This looks good|, This is so many women’s worst relationship nightmare being with an abusive narcissist. It sent chills down my spine just watching this trailer.|, Anna Kendrick needs a second Oscar nomination. She really deserves it."

Alita was my favorite comic then and has just become one of my fav movie now... can’t believe it was written so long ago yet it is still way ahead of its time! Great job to the producers 🙏🏻💕|, i speak for thousands maybe millions of fans when i say “ we want a sequel”|, I don't know why people didn't even watch it in theaters. It was a freaking awesome movie. I can't tolerate the fact that it doesn't have a sequel.|, I regret not watching this earlier this film was an absolute MASTERPIECE|, Imagine how great the movie is when the movie feels like its 30 mins even though its 2 hours long|, I just watched it. I don't think I have ever cried so much in a movie before. It's has all my favorite genres mixed together: action, post-apocalyptic, drama and love taken place in a beautiful setting with great visual effects. This has just became my favorite movie ever. Maybe a movie one day might change my mind, but this movie will always stick to my mind and I will never forget about it. I wished there was were sequels to this. I have absolutely no regret watching this; in fact it made me feel like a better person.|, Just watched it. Cannot describe how amazing it is. The effects, cast and story. Can't wait for part 2.|, i dont care what the critics say, this is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen.. hope it gets a sequel!|, This movie is simply the best I've ever seen in my whole life and it would be a disaster if no sequel was planned.
I've seen it 7 times at theaters and i intend to buy blu-ray at its release.
It's the contrast between gentleness and phenomenal violence of which she's capable that makes the character so fascinating and endearing.|, Really couldn't understand why this movie wasnt talked about more. I loved every second of it. This movie needs a sequel."
All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt,All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt | Official Trailer HD | A24,qiQvFKfpCi4,278538,9974,615,"I saw this movie at Sundance and absolutely loved it. It’s less of a traditional movie, it doesn’t have a tight narrative, it’s more like watching someone’s life unfold over time. Like what you see when your “life flashes before your eyes” at death. It’s a meditative, slow, beautiful, nostalgic movie about life’s beauty and tragedy. I hope people give this movie the chance it deserves. And the patience to enjoy it.|, Without even 100% knowing the storyline I teared up at how visually stunning this is. Can’t wait.|, I’m so glad that more stories like this can even see the light of day. I know they’ve been written plenty before but to see them being picked up by major movie production companies like a24 is tear jerking in it self. This is a new era for black film I can feel it. Maybe even the first era.|, I wish the directors,writers and everyone who actually put time and effort into creatively bringing these films to life got the same amount of recognition that a24 gets.|, Que elenco incrível, ansiosa para assistir 🥰|, Having only been in existence since 2012, A24 has a near stranglehold on the most creative, thought-provoking fare you’ll likely encounter anywhere in cinema these days. If the company had as many decades under its belt—and pockets as deep as its larger competitors—it wouldn’t even be a competition, not even close. 

They are the ONLY production company of which I have made a concerted effort to see and *OWN* every single release thus far…and this film will be no exception. For me, a new A24 release can turn a catastrophically bad day rather celebratory. Never, EVER change!🙏🏽🙌🏽✊🏽🥰🔥🔥🔥|, Que elenco perfeito, mostra perfeitamente a realidade de muitos.|, Chorei só vendo o trailer, imagina quando sair o filme vou desatar a chorar sem parar. Assistam vale muito a pena.|, Só pelo trailer a gente consegue ver que vai ser muito emocionante ❤❤❤|, Que elenco maravilhoso.... Por mais filmes que mostrem essa realidade"

All the Money in the World,ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD - Official Trailer (HD),KXHrCBkIxQQ,7272985,22494,1672,"Really love this movie! It is super Intense and full of twists and turns. Michelle Williams really takes the cake for being Strong and basically standing up to everyone. She refuses to give up! Outstanding Acting and so ironic that this movie is about a cheaper than cheap tyrant who refused to pay ANY taxes and put all his money in a giant tax shelter that was supposed to help people and never did--and this man refused to pay a ransom to pay his grandson--and Michelle Williams didn't get even half of what Mark Wahlberg did for those re-takes. It was SO unfair that they did that to her. I DO adore Mark Wahlberg 100% and I don't think any of that was from him at all. She just really deserved as much as he made.
I love the scene where they are driving to meet the grandfather to ask for the money and Mark Wahlberg finally admits he didn't do enough. He says ""he may be stupid but he's not lazy! Do not call him Lazy!""  oh, that's a fabulously intense scene. Classic! And of course Wahlberg is neither stupid or lazy :) This movie is Classy, fast and smart!!! Can be watched many times. Though I skipped the bad parts with Paul's captivity--very very violent. Other than that--
Mucho Grazie for an Outstanding Movie!  ❤❤❤|, Didn't think I'd like this movie. Thought it might be too full of itself. I was wrong. It's fantastic. Brilliant opening scenes ,which tell you how Getty made his money, and then it's beautiful cinematography engages you all the way through. One of the best movies of the year, or any year. On the big screen it looked imposing and weighty. Not so much on the small screen, but the acting and story will make anyone with a modicum of intelligence agree with those who say it's one of Ridley Scott's best in years.|, I want to see this film. It has Ridley Scott's signature and that says it all. The man is a legend.I hope both him and Plummer win an Oscar for this.They deserve it.I also like how Mark Wahlberg has evolved as an actor all these years, from Boogie Nights until now.|, Ridley Scott actually did it. The absolute madman.|, Ridley Scott deserves a nomination just for being able to pull this off in time for the original release|, This actually doesn’t look like a bad Movie, Mark is a good actor, and this Movie looks good|, This was a great film. I honestly enjoyed Michelle Williams acting in this one.|, Idc wat anyone says this trailer is great, gave me chills. Love the orchestra version of the music and the editing is very intriguing|, The way she dropped the phone had me laughing so hard lmao|, I think I'm blessed because if not I wouldn't have met someone who is as spectacular as expert Mrs Lucy Mary Liam"

When I asked her how was it, she said it was just.. beautiful. This trailer obviously can't convey and evoke the real magic of the movie, which she described as sth on the border between a thriller and a real love story, all wrapped up with truly incredible visuals, high quality special effects and sound, with great music and cast.. just a heart breaking movie worth watching.

A really incredible movie and what made the movie more insane was the fact that it was based on a true story.|, Watched this movie a while ago, although I’m only writing this comment now. This is such an underrated movie that doesn’t get NEARLY the amount of praise and hype it deserves|, Tremendous movie! The courage it took to continue on for three years knowing there was probably no light at the end of the tunnel!|, *Just finished watching this movie and man, was it really good! That ending really made me realize the power of speech, whether that be written or spoken. Wow!*|, Someone please give Brendan Gleeson an Academy Award.|, Love all the actors/actresses in the film and it looks fantastic. Definitely something different from the normal WW2 movie.|, Such a powerful powerful movie 🎥 based on true heroes...incredible performances by the leads and the entire cast|, Brendan Gleeson has never been in a bad movie|, This is very well made trailer, there's a lot of questions in mind when the trailer ended, that's a good sign. This movie is probably the 3rd to 4th time that Daniel has played a Nazi soldier, I would think he's being a lil trap in the role.

Take my money!|, I cried so hard during this movie because I watched it 1 week after I got my service dog in training and he was only 10 weeks old then. Watching this movie and seeing how they saved each other warmed my heart because it reminds me of how my dog saves my life almost every day and gives me the freedom to live an independent life, He now attends school with me and goes everywhere with me he has grown up so much and turns one year old in one month and I can't believe how much he has grown. I am so thankful for him and the bond that we have it feels like it's unbreakable so thank you Nahko for being my Alpha|, One of the things I love about this movie is that the wolf is played by . . . a wolf! Not necessarily the gender the wolf is supposed to be in the movie, but a good performer! It's a live-action story that can leave you with a new appreciation for the ancestors of dogs.|, The quality and detail of this film is spectacular. The scenes they put in of the skies is just amazingly breathtaking. Who agrees?|, If you're here wondering if you should see this, go see it. This is a great movie about the development of a leader and is awesome for self reflection and really encourages you to think about how hard you would fight to survive under these circumstances.|, Great movie! Beautiful cinematography. A very strange story of adventure & survival, in a very primitive time. The movie really immerses you in in the story. I think the trailer is actually underselling it. You won't be disappointed. This movie is really worth watching!|, Just saw this film, loved every minute. A+ for story building, A++ For featuring an extinct language rather than American/British English, A+++ for featuring the first good boi. I rate it 5 out of 5 Wolf Pups|, Just finished watching this movie with my fam and I must say, I loved every bit of it. 
It was a roller coaster ride for me. 
The big reveal at the end was a good surprise. 10/10 🥰|, The final scene with the hunters' silhouette with a wolf in their side is my favorite. I almost hear myself saying ""no species on earth can survive this alliance""|, What's really magnificent about this movie is that it shapes your mentality into thinking what circumstances we would be in Keda's situation, with each obstacle surging through our thoughts of decision for survival. I personally don't know what my situation would be like since I haven't gone through an experience similar to Keda, so I don't know what I truly possess in strength, agility, speed, endurance & intelligence in a harsh outdoor environment. But what I can say is that I would love to reside in an isolated location, for example somewhere in the Coniferous forests of Canada or Iceland where I have a cabin to live in with a gorgeous view from either the front or back side, with two or three German Shepherds or other breed similar to the one in the movie. My goal would be to live a life away from the constantly obnoxious society & traverse through snowy lands in search of an adventure I never had. If there's any way I could describe it for anyone reading to understand what I seek in my journey, here's how I envision it;
""Traveling along the lands encoated by white with my companions, I hunt fish & small animals as I discover new acres in search of a perfect spot to sit and admire the auroras dancing in the clear night sky. Miles are numbered as I find all sorts of wild northern animals from Elk, foxes, snow rabbits, Blue Jays & Red Cardinals. As my companions run circles around while I walk, the sun sets a pink-orange fade on the dimming sky, & finally after some work I manage to find a slightly steep acre in which I find a tall Spruce tree to lay my back on as the night sinks in. My fine companions howl at the stunning auroras waving back, the crisp cold breath seeps out their mouths & as do mine while we stare up at the bright stars winking at us, & my ecstatic enthusiasm to travel further is brought upon my adventurous mind.""
Well folks that's all, thank you for reading & take it easy ✌"

It was amazing and great i even picked up some new knowledge on our history. This is a must watch.|, I was actually quite surprised by the movie. The first half lists the major and supposed sins of America that they committed over the years and the second half explains how most of these things were either not completely true or not solely an American wrong, but a Worldly wrong.

Soon he'll be A-listing it up next to DiCaprio at the Oscar's! 👏|, Oh man, when I started watching this film, the emotions flooded me with vengeance. This was a great film and would watch it again! This guy who becomes an Assassin to avenge the death of his girlfriend and fellow Americans who were killed by terrorists...breathtaking film that will definitely set you on the edge of your seat.|, I'm so proud of Dyl. He's grown up from The Maze and Beacon Hills..... Look at him now! <3|, Dylan O'Brien is such a good actor.|, I love that he's getting the attention he deserves :) I've been watching his things since season one of teen wolf (which I still rewatch) and I'm so excited for this!|, I havent been this excited for a movie in a long time! Dylan will be one of the greatest actors in history in the future, I can feel it. 😆👏|, He is without a doubt the breakout star of Teen Wolf. I hope Dylan's acting career lasts a good long while with more than a few great films to his name. This film looks awesome and I can't wait to see it."
American Honey,Lady Antebellum - American Honey (Official Music Video),Tzzr7RbzUTs,18256741,95291,3275,"I always come back to this song, it never gets old and always has more meaning as world falls into further chaos.|, Soothing 👏👏|, In the 1970's I met my blond American honey. I was in Australia back then and I met her in a bar....she became my honey for two years but life and circumstances pulled us apart. I miss her so much, especially the sweet times we had with each other. Forty five years later and still pining!!|, I love it|, An absolute masterpiece|, My mother passed 9 years ago, I’ll never forget this song playing at her funeral. It brings back so many memories.|, I always have the feeling with Lady Antebellum that what she sings, she really means from the heart! She delivers!|, Listened to this song when I was a little girl . Loved it then and love it now ❤|, This song makes me think of my middle daughter.  She's just now become a young adult, and in her special way she's making it look so easy.  I feel like the part of my heart that belongs to her stops when I pray for her.  I hope her world always rolls along like a beautiful summer day in the middle of August in Alabama.|, 2:29-2:35 Always gets me.

American Hustle,American Hustle - Official International Trailer,NqgjPRNRDSY,1654557,4108,277,"I can see why people might find this movie boring but I personally loved it. You have to really pay attention to it and watch it as a movie, pay attention to the writing, the preformances, the direction, and as a movie this is a pretty damn good movie|, Byłem w kinie.Naprawdę wart poświęcenia,ciekawy scenariusz,świetna muzyka,gra aktorów.Może środek trochę rozciągnięty przez co tempo nieco zwalnia.Polecam|, there was like no action but it has this incredible soundtrack and great overlapping narration that makes it one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie captures the 70's so so amazingly well its like you go back in time. The only bad part is (SPOILERS) what happens to Carmine, he really was the only ""good guy"" in the movie|, I had come to have high expectations after Russell's last two outings, which were basically celluloid cocaine. In those two, I was EMOTIONALLY INVESTED, in the reality, of how believable it was, and then everything else clicked. The snappy dialogue, the ELECTRIC energy, the rockin' soundtrack, etc., all supported and enhanced the story, because there was a foundation laid.|, Awesome performance by Christian Bale. My favorite is when he meets Miami boss played by Robert de Niro.  You can see the look of intimidation in Christian eyes!! Powerful scene.    |, Great movie, great cast, and great sound track.  Little surprised by some of the negative comments Christian Bale was amazing (as usual) as was Amy Adams (looking chic in her 70's wardrobe)  To each his own I loved it!|, What a Great Film with superb performances all around. It was funny, serious and everything you want from David O' Russell. There was a Great cameo by DeNiro and he and Bale played beautifully off one another. Speaking of Bale, he was Flawless I loved his Dynamic with Amy Adams who should get a Oscar Nom for this and Jennifer Lawrence who was fabulous in her small role. I also loved Bradley Cooper he took his role and really sunk his teeth into it and again Bale and he were fabulous together. I can't say enough good about this film.A def must see. Bale should get a Oscar nomination as well. |, Absolutely LOVED this movie!!!!!!
How many people realized that Batman, Lois Lane, Hawkeye, Mystique, and Rocket Racoon were the stars of this Masterpiece? It took me a while to realize DC and Marvel combine in a Twilight Zone effect here!|, Classic. Can't wait to see this film, I love the 70s!|, This has got to be the #1 example of a phenomenal trailer that is 500% better than the actual movie. This is an A+ trailer and a C movie."
American Made,American Made - Official Trailer [HD],AEBIJRAkujM,15039484,36797,2419,"This was a great movie. Cruise made you feel like he was the character rather than simply playing him. He should make more historic/biographical movies like this one.|, As much as I enjoy Cruise in action films, it's great to see him doing films like these.|, I just saw this movie in Hong Kong. You will NOT be disappointed. Tom Cruise gives what is perhaps the best performance of his career. The script is tight, acting is incredible, and the intercutting with historical footage is seamless. I have seen more than a dozen major releases this year, and this may be the best all round. Don't be surprised if it gets mentioned a lot come Oscar time. absolutely loved it.|, Love this type of movies like the Wolf of Wallstreet or War Dogs. American Made is heaviliy underrated, one of the best of 2017.|, This looks awesome!  As much as I love Tom Cruise action movies, I LOVE that Tom Cruise is being given the chance to play a deep character role.  It's been quite some time.|, Recently watched it and I Highly recommend it. Probably one of my favorites for 2017. Good acting, writing, directing, almost all of it is nearly perfect 9.5/10 for me|, Never seen a Tom Cruise movie I didn't at least like. This looks like one I'm gonna love. Way to go, Tom! Keep 'em coming as Hollywood implodes!|, Excellent movie and a great performance by Tom Cruise.|, Now this looks like a great movie! Huge fan of Tom Cruise! He always delivers!|, The story of Barry Seal is an amazing thrill ride. And it's 100% true. I've done A lot of research and looking into this guys story and if this movie is anything to go by, it's gonna be great."

This was one of the best movies I've seen this year. You will not regret watching this.|, 90% of the fanbase can't watch this in theatres without a parent or guardian and it's fucking hilarious 😂|, I am quite sad that Andy didn't use his actual singing voice in his movie, but he used Remington Leith's singing voice from the band Palaye Royal. Andy Biersack has an amazing voice and band but I get why he did it. And to find out that Booboo Stewart is also in this movie? 👏👌|, Whether the movie is good or bad, I think we can all agree the soundtrack is bound to be kickass.|, Andy Biersack, Ben Bruce e Drake Bell no mesmo filme ?

American Sniper,American Sniper - One Mile Shot,EMvEm2jKDKU,2298954,18677,1208,"""That's more than a mile, it's impossible Chris.""

Chris: Say sike right now.|, It's the fact that this actually happened in real life that blows my mind. Because of how long the bullet is in the air over such a distance, the rotation of the entire EARTH could derail the shot|, This was so intense.  The scene makes you feel like you are there.  Bradley Cooper is such a good actor who can play many different parts from a comedian, to a singer, and a sniper.    So sad how Chris Kyle's life ended.   So unexpected.|, Iv tried long range shooting, I couldn’t hit a barn door at 500 meters, I can’t imagine the skill, dedication and pure perseverance needed to get to a point of pulling of a shot like that 👏|, You need to calculate distance ,air velocity ,bullet deviation while travelling through air which a gifted sniper knows very well. More than anything there is a element of chance & luck which helps the sniper .Not every shot would hit the target but snipers are special talent .|, It still enrages me that Chris was killed by one of our own, at home, and in particular while helping a vet work through a severe case of PTSD! Chris is a hero, selfless and a perfect example of what a great American looks like! He will never be forgotten! 🇺🇸💪|, ""If you got it take it man"" Is such a powerful line. To have the utmost confidence in Chris to hit such an improbable shot is beautiful.|, I remember I got a 1900m headshot in BF3. Best day of my life.|, The guy he shot was actually an insurgent on a roof with an RPG trying to shoot down a Army Convoy. 
Chris wasn’t trying to kill the man at first because the weapon wasn’t visible. The moment the convoy came the insurgent raised the weapon then giving Chris a clear ROE. He adjusted and took the shot within seconds. 
This makes the shot much more impressive to me because of the urgency of the shot. 
Still a cool scene though|, Not every  shot can be  tracked down and accurately  recorded, but this one was and it was beautiful."
American Ultra,"American Ultra Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart Comedy HD",bLGFwkRx2HA,6145529,33706,1874,"I just watched this movie and was shocked at how great it was, I have no idea why it got so much hate and why critics gave it such low ratings. It's so entertaining. I actually avoided seeing this movie as I assumed it was awful but no It's one of the best films I've seen in ages.|, Was a good movie. One of those movies you feel you could watch for hours and not feel it. Kristen Stewart is amazingly beautiful as always and Jesse played his part well.|, 15 minutes into this movie and the tenderness of it had me on the edge of tears. Love Kristen.|, This has quickly become one of my favorite movies. To each is own (many bad reviews and lower ratings), but I thought there is excellent character development, a really good story, and excellent ""fun"" acting. Just as good as any Marvel movie.|, They are selling this as a comedy but it was a lot more dramatic than I expected. Sure there are a few laughs here and there, but it was more action packed, suspenseful, and actually kind of tragic. Great acting all around. You really feel for Eisenberg's character in some ways even more than Matt Damon's Jason Bourne because here he actually seems kind of relatable. Kristen Stewart was really good too. My favorite was Walton Grobbit as Laughter. A superb performance. 
Topher Grace was a pretty good villain as well. If only Red was there to put his foot in his ass!|, I like Kristen Stewart, man. I think she gets way too much undeserved hate.|, I am so stoked for this movie. It seems interesting and hilarious and epic. Plus, I love Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg so I can't wait for this awesomeness!|, This movie looks stupid but honestly it's very funny and cute and sweet like these two work so perfectly together 😫😍☺️|, I love Jesse Eisenberg. Man, he's such a great actor and person. And he gets so many unnecessary hate.|, I actually liked this movie it was quite good and entertaining. I hope they make a 2nd one or at least some sort of spinoff movie."
American Underdog,"American Underdog (2021 Movie) Official Trailer - Zachary Levi, Anna Paquin, and Dennis Quaid",_6rn-6lKBJ8,1629735,7297,650,"This was a good movie even if you are not a football fan.  What the Rams did to Warner after he got injured to try and destroy his career and reputation, and how he made his comeback with the Cardinals, is an equally inspiring story.  Not once did he defy odds and prove his skeptics wrong; he did it twice.  The story of his comeback career needs to be made into American Underdog 2.  It’s shameful what the Rams organization did to him after he brought them out of the cellar of the NFL and made their franchise into a winning respected team with a universal fan base.  One of the most talented and humble QBs ever yet hardly any new NFL fan has even heard of him.  I hope this movie brings him the recognition he deserves.|, A wonderful movie.  Football, romance, faith...solid acting.  A really great way to spend a couple hours.  I already knew the story from being a football fan----but seeing them bring it to life in a movie was everything I'd hoped it would be.|, My mom, My family and I have all been Rams fans for decades! I lost my mom on 9-25-01. The last conversation we had was about Kurt Warner and the Rams. She was such a fan! I can't wait to see this movie about him and I know my mom will be seeing it with me as well! RIP Eva 🙏✝KW 13 GOAT!🏈|, I have just seen this movie.  Allow me to say that I am a Ram fan, and thus, a Kurt Warner fan.  The movie is very, very well done.  It may not thrill every football fan.  Still, they stay true to the amazing, amazing Warner story.  Kudos to the filmmakers.  I was very pleased.|, My wife and I watched today and I must say that it was so refreshing to see such an exceptional movie without the Hollywood cursing, sex scenes or drug use! Kudos to the directors and producers for a phenomenal family cinematic experience!! Highly recommend for all ages.|, My oldest son just gave me the DVD for my birthday.  I just watched it, and it is excellent!  Prepare yourself to get teary-eyed and choked up.  Great story about a great man!|, I saw this movie not too long ago. It was so amazing, detailing the rise of Kurt Warner from working in a grocery store to starting in the NFL in five years! I’m glad they stayed true to Kurt’s story! As a Dolphins fan, I have a newfound level of respect for Kurt. Awesome movie and story!|, I'm going to tell you what I hated about this movie, the advertisement for it. I can't believe I hadn't seen any press for it. This was such a great movie and Zachary Levi killed it. This movie was so good and it hits you. I watched Kurt's HOF speech and it shows how they tried to accurately make this movie.|, Watched this movie with my 9 year old daughter, who isn’t a football fan btw. I’m crazy about football, niners fan, and certainly watched Kurt Warner back in the day. The movie has a little too much cheese for my liking but the football scenes were good and overall it’s a very nice family movie with a wonderful message. My daughter enjoyed it too. We need more movies like this and fewer mindless avengers/spider man movies|, I watched this last night. You cant help but leave the theater feeling somewhat inspired by such a great movie. Acting was surprisingly superb. 8.5/10"

It’s hard role and not that easy to transfert this kind of emotions but he is just as I said brilliant|, this was such a scary movie!
worth the time to watch loved it|, i don't watch horror movies especially when I'm alone but if Cameron is there, i don't care. I must watch it! 👍❤|, This trailer actually looks pretty good! Usually it's hard for scary movie trailers to scare me, but this one freaked me out a little lol I definitely want to see it. |, I feel like I'm the only one here who actually wants to see this lol|, NO matter how many people may hate horror films nowadays or the fact that Bella Thorne is starring in this film.. I actually still wanna see it|, This honestly looks real good, gave me chills especially the actor Cameron ...my god his facial expressions were soo sadistic.|, I can't wait for bella to be in this I think she should do more horror|, I watched it the other night and I actually really enjoyed it!

Ammonite,"AMMONITE Trailer (2020) Saoirse Ronan, Kate Winslet Movie",Yd_nsFJAXV4,1983490,28581,2067,"I read the title and I IMMEDIATELY knew who this biography was going to be about. Mary Anning. She inspired the tongue twister ""She sells seashells by the seashore"". I read a book about her when I was 15 and it baffles me how such a smart and hardworking woman didn't get the recognition she deserved in discovering those fossils, mostly by herself, and instead others took credit for her hard work. 
It's nice to see that they made a movie about her though.

Update: The book I read was titled ""The Fossil Hunter"" by Shelley Emling.|, this guy really just went and got his wife a girlfriend. a true ally 😌😌|, Its such a beautiful movie. There is very little dialogue, but the most powerful scenes are silent and motionless. The emotion portrayed by Kate and Saoirse in these moments are incredible: palpable, raw, pure, and soulshattering.|, I loved this film. It was a great adaptation of Mary's life and I felt I was watching genuine people who loved and desired one another and not just beautiful famous actresses. I was hesitant at first to watch, due to the age difference but it turned out to be a meeting of mutually intelligent and mature minds despite the age difference of almost two decades. Kate Winslet's mature beauty and acting talent was a perfect match with her younger counterparts youthful beauty and acting talent. Their love scenes made me feel desire, love and my heart race with it's realism. They effectively portrayed the wanting of pleasure of all kinds, like wanting to exchange pleasure equally, through being pleasured and providing pleasure to your lover. Definitely buying this on DVD and Blu ray if I can! Thank you for a wonderful film 😊🥰|, Saoirse is pure talent and blended with Kate's talent it just makes the whole thing PERFECT!!|, I loved this movie, very much, there were scenes I expected Kate to cry like when her mother passed away and when she separated from Ronan, but she held back the tears, she did not cry dramatically like in many movies. I loved those scenes more. It is so realistic in the sense that there are people who are usually like that. Perfect acting and writing. Overall it was a good movie to watch.|, Honestly, Saoirse Ronan is like a porcelain doll in this one.|, Two incredible actresses in a class of their own. Been a fan of both Winslet and Ronan for some time now, so very glad they worked together.|, saoirse never disappoints and so glad to see kate winslet again|, It's an amazing movie with amazing cast. It's slow pace makes it more interesting and intense. I loved it. 😍These women deserves an oscar for those expressions."

Thank-you for the journey and respectful nature done of the video. Happy Halloween 🎃|, Amy was an old soul who's voice pierced your heart and made it warm and tingly. Such a talent. I'll never forget when she passed, it was very sad.|, I wasn't a fan of her music, but I did see her documentary and I can appreciate her talent, her ability to write and play her own music, her attitude and her personal struggles that turned her to alcohol. She was a force, that's for sure, and the way she went was very tragic and all too familiar for artists. I hope wherever she is, she has peace and comes back someday to share her talents again. ( I think reincarnation is very plausible, so I do think she will come back to this plain, if she desires.) Thank you for this video, it was informative and it's lovely to see the how those around her remember her. 🖤💜💋🌹⚘🍒|, Anyone who doubts she could actually sing, (without modern technology like most modern pop stars) search for the acoustic version of  her singing ""Valerie"" ... Its so natrual and her voice is just .. well, amazing. She even checks her watch while she sings i believe (been awhile since i watched it) so natrual without ANY straining or effort... 
Simply ine if the greatest vouces of our time. 
She also was very very generous with her time for fans etc, and i know a guy and his wife who were in a pub in jorth London when sge came in with a group of friends and sat at a table drinking and chatting and asking about people, no ""don't touch me"" ""no eye contact"" etc, she pushed my mate gently and laughed loudly at a joke and was just ""one of the lads"" so to speak.. norhing ""star"" like about her and she bought rounds and rubbed shoulders with patrons in the pub, going to ""the loo"" or ""the bog"" as she called it by herself ... A very down to earth natural lady...he said you could easily forget she was a mega star, she hated that mentality and stayed her natural self all her life...Sadly missed.|, Back to black, Valerie and rehab are my favorites. Amy Winehouse was an amazing talent and it was and still is incredibly sad to remember she is no longer with us. ❤ RIP Amy - What a legend 🎤🎵|, Amy Winehouse was a beautiful lady and artist, I was a latecomer to her music and once I heard her, I had to hear all of her songs. Another artist lost at the very young age of 27. You both talked about her with respect and warmth. RIP Amy Winehouse.|, What a beautiful singer songwriter! Thanks for sharing such a beautiful tribute. Love and respect to the both of you!|, It’s so sad another legend was lost at the age of 27, that’s the age I am now and every time I see a singer, or artist or actor or actress in the news having died young or from overdose, breaks my heart. Amy had a voice that can never be replicated, she won’t ever be forgotten. Always missed. Hope you are resting well in Heaven beautiful. ❤thank you besties for this beautiful video, I’m so glad you guys went to visit her beautiful final resting place.

LOVE IT|, Thank you, Al Gore.  I especially liked the way your movie showed clips of misinformation contrasted with calm reason.  

The implications of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are frightening.  I agree, Democracy has been hacked.  I don't know how to solve that problem...except to encourage everyone who clearly understands climate change to expand their network of friends to include all kinds of people.  Help your new friends understand how important this is, seeing the world through their eyes and finding the way that millions of coastal residents can be saved from catastrophic losses and frightening political implications that may generate refugee crises far exceeding what we've seen in Syria.

More immediately, we need to create more environmentally positive jobs to employ coal miners, the white men and Russians who helped Trump become President, and all segments of our economy in this country as well as abroad.  The job loss argument is a major tactic being used by those who neglect environmental resource conservation.|, This made me cry, what has our world come to?|, This trailer is awesome.|, This is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. This will definitely show the residents of the United States the facts of climate change!|, Wonderful eye-opening movie piece.

A cracking trilogy for Gerald Butler he’s pulled these movies off really well!👏🏼|, Imagine Mike Banning, Bryan Mills, and John Wick on a team.|, I dont care how many movies like this they make I'll watch every single one with great pleasure!|, Very exciting, action packed movie. Loved Nick Nolte’s character as well as Morgan Freeman.|, Morgan Freeman as God, president, etc. 

He's played them all hasn't he?|, I love Gerard Butler! Such a good actor and can’t wait to see this movie|, I went to see Angel Has Fallen because my mum is a fan and wanted to go. I ended up really enjoying it. It was fun! Loads of action and explosions. I did wonder how they made that small child look so terrified though and whether they hired a therapist afterwards!|, the movie is amazing. the actors are awesome, the storyline, the effects. 👍👍👍 will definitely watch the next 'has fallen' sequel😄"

I must admit that I do sympathize with every single character in this movie version. However,  I can’t help but blame Anna for her own demise. I understand she did not marry for love and that’s the way it was back then but she did choose her lover over her own son. This  I simply cannot understand. Wonderful version as compared to the more glamorous Greta Garbo one.|, A truly beautiful movie that's been done many times. Perhaps because it has so much to it, i.e. love, hate, marriage, divorce, adultery, disappointment, God, wealth, poverty. I read the book in school and saw a few film versions. But this one really sucked me in more than all others. I agreed with a comment here that this is how this story should have been filmed and I'm sure Tolstoy would have loved this version too. It's a beautiful production, all actors render very sensitive performances. I've thoroughly enjoyed it even though it's such a sad story|, I love this tragic tale. People are complicated, and I sympathize with each character in this story at one point or another. Thank you for uploading !|, Thank you so much for including this special version!  I saw a version of Anna Karenina over a decade ago on television...I was left wondering why the hype? This version was so beautifully done with each character playing an in depth part, I was mesmerized and saw it much closer to what I believed it should be. The actors/actresses were perfect, the garments and accessories, the scenery and each set design was so well thought out...(including the ""noisy"" wood floor as they walked through the inside.)
How sad what a lack of love can make some people do. Making decisions they would never make otherwise...|, Best portrayal of Anna I’ve seen so far. No offense to Keira Knightley, Sophie Marceau, and Elizaveta Boyarskaya, they all played Anna differently according to their understanding of her character. But Vittoria Puccini in this version played her so beautifully and dynamically. Best version of Alexei Karenin too. He was colder and more detached in the book, and at the end of the novel, Countess Ivanovna managed to make him believe in mysticism and occultism. Karenin in this version has a more realistic reaction, more practical, and is more humane. This mini series is not perfect, but you can’t deny that production quality and amazing cast.|, _I keep this mini-series on my Playlist to replay from time to time. I do have a sense of pity for the woman (and at times men) of this Time Period that were coerced into loveless marriages for the sake of families, wealth or position. I feel for the character of “Anna”, because regardless of what she has - it’s love of self that has escaped her. She gives all her love to her son, expecting to be emotionally satisfied with his. She is overwhelmed at the attention from Count Vronsky, which she scorns and accuses whenever the appearance of that attention wavers, but Anna never is shown loving self. Everything she has ever done was for someone else and she is incapable of discerning that even this extreme extra marital affair was done to satisfy the vain curiosity of “Another man” and the confused mind never allowed to mature in Self.  We’ve all watched Films and read novels that attempt to glorify “coveting” and infidelity, we turn the channel or put down the book.

Antlers,ANTLERS | Final Trailer [HD] | Searchlight Pictures,ng5eyOfL8qM,6372025,51587,5262,"I absolutely love these folklore horror movies. 
Bringing all these stories to life in a movie. 

It looks as if this is ganna be a wendigo which is something I've wanted in some form of modern culture for years. 

Keep bringing me these old gods and monsters stories!|, I love the allegory of a child caring for a parent who is sick. It is soul crushing. This movie looks equal parts horror, family drama and tragedy.|, My cousin Jeremy is Lucas in this film. So proud of him. He has had other very small roles like in walking dead.|, Out of all the supernatural creatures used time and time again in horror and folklore, The Wendigo is the only one I have ever found truly terrifying. A creature so much more than an undead monstrosity craving blood or flesh. Not the mindless ravening of a zombie or the charming grace of a vampire; no...a Wendigo is the epitome of true savagery. A manifestation of pure, distilled malevolence. Greed, desire and gluttony all wrapped together in a putrid, desiccated shell. The Wendigo is a representation of the darkest parts of the human soul, which makes its appearance all the more traumatizing.|, After two whole years of waiting, I finally got to watch it today!! I just finished watching it a few minutes ago. In short, Antlers was really suspenseful and very well told. I read the short story the film was based on, so I knew what would happen when I got the film started. The creature design was also fantastic.|, I just watched this movie and I am in love with the way the aesthetic and scenes were done so well. It really added to the horror.|, This is gonna be really good,  the Wendigo is hardly ever talked about in horror.|, Good movie, i loved it ... It was extremely thought provoking and visually stunning, as a horror movie fan i felt like it hit all the right buttons for me, the story was great, acting was superb and it was really intense from start to finish, i will say this movie is not for the faint of heart though.|, Being a russian, the whole north-american atmosphere is so close to my soul. It seems like we have to much in common in our lives (lifestyle) with the people who live in northern states . So every story, every movie...everything that happens regarding to this atmosphere makes the feeling in the chest i can`t describe....
Looking forward (or waiting with impatience (don`t know how exactly to say this in english)) for the ""Antlers"" movie!!!|, Saw the film last night it blew me away, the horror, suspense, and acting this is the best monster flick in a long while."
Apocalypse Now,(APOCALYPSE NOW 1979 ) FULL MOVIE,edgjrj5eaig,161357,2400,372,"One of the greatest films ever made. I first saw this in New York when it came out in 1979. I was 21 years old and nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. The characters portrayed by Brando and Sheen had a profound psychological impact on me. Monumental work by Coppola and a great cast.|, I served in Vietnam in 1966. When I got out of the Army, I told myself, a movie about Vietnam is not a film I wanted to see. Then Apocalypse Now came out. This, I said, I would watch. Coppola's take on the Vietnam War was ingenious. For me, this film was like a ""psychological war drama."" Thank you for posting it and giving me the opportunity of watching it again.|, This film is a study of morality in every way.  What is morality, is there true morality, what are the possible effects of our ideas of morality, what happens when our sense of morality is challenged, etc.  Absolutely top tier film|, This film had all kinds of crazy baggage.  Like Coppola continuously changing the script.  Sheen having a heart attack. Army not allowing the use of the military Huey's. Etc.,etc. Oh, for those who
didn't know this, Sheen really did cut his hand open after hitting the mirror in the opening scene.  Coppola loved it and told Martin to play it up despite his obvious discomfort. I could go on and on.  But I love this film too much.  Saw It on the big screen and it blew my ass away.  It's incredibly authentic.  And I love it.|, Im so glad to find this Masterpiece .it has more meaning now that it did in 1979 when i first viewed it.  Coppola is an absolute genius. The great cast Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Dennis Hopper, Robert Duvall, Harrison Ford. Laurence Fishburne, among many other talented artists helped this film become the success it did.Based on Joseph Conrads novel ""Heart of Darkness""1899 and nominated for 8 Academy Awards ,this is one of the top films ever created. The horror of war ,the sheer terror ,the revealing of the coldness each one of us is capable of within our own hearts and minds. Psychological and dramatic thriller centering around the atrocitities of the VietNam war. A must watch, over and over again.|, Great film...the Doors song 'The End' brought me here after 15-20yrs since seeing ReDux version.

My Pops avoided getting drafted by joining the Navy.  He thot he'd be out on a boat in the middle of the ocean but ended up a boatsman on the Danang river!  He is still kickin' and has so many great stories.  Im 48, never served in any armed force and feel like the pressure that he was under while in Vietnam was so intense at times...I will just never understand how he made it thru those couple years.  

Ive read so many biographies and autobiographies of Vietnam, The Korean War, Desert Storm and WWII.  Seen all the shows and movies and still just really think this is ONE of (if not THE) best motion picture ever capturing the evil of war, and the madness that men (and women) had to suffer thru.|, I can't believe this has been on YouTube for 2 years. One of the greatest films of all time.
I have the dvd but it's nice to have a way to watch on mobile.|, Rest In Peace, Frederic Forrest, you are missed and you were great in this film as Chef!|, At that time I became one of the few who was there for the veterans I was a nurse taking care of them ,being there for them at any moments of time. I made a promise to each of them .I promise to be there in their end of time. I was there at their funeral each and everyone of them. And now their all gone . This War is over for me now . Today I'm a member of The American Legion.|, I have been blessed lately with a lot of sterling films. I'll see how I feel a few years from now, but I'm confident this is one of the greatest works of cinema I've seen, regardless of what you feel about the war in Viet Nam. One of Brando's best roles. The best role for Martin Sheen I've seen yet. And of course standout performances all around--Forrest, Fishburne, Hopper[I'm watching one of his first, Night Tide 1961, right now--what a trip! I love his crazy hippie characters], Duvall . . I probably need to re-watch Godfather, which I actually saw when it FIRST CAME OUT, but I like this one better. I mean Coppola's use of shadow, scenes, images, cut and fade, faces . . that is real cinema. Maybe a bit on the grim side, but I saw an interview with Coppola which confirmed what I always understood about Americans' experience with this bad war--just too much of a contradiction; a real war is when there is something dear to defend, like Ukraine right now. I sure as hell had no intention to go, I had a deferment, but my heart truly goes out to anyone who had to fight . . This is a pretty grim movie, though, and it's understandable some people won't connect with it . ."

His mom and dad both alive and well and he and Orm building a new relationship instead of always being enemies. Absolutely love it.|, Patrick Wilson is fantastic in everything he's in. He had already delivered for DC with his brilliant portrayal of The Night Owl in Zack Snyder's acclaimed Watchmen. He continues to do a good job playing Orm as well.

I'm looking forward to seeing more of Jason and his dynamic as brothers, and the spectacular visuals of Atlantis|, Black Manta is example perfect accurate villain with his suit been exactly right. And they are bringing him back, every scene he gives me shivers.  Why they can't do this justice for other characters I will never know.|, Funny how Mera only appears for half a second and looks like an insane woman trying to escape imprisonment|, I love how Amber Heard is sidelined in the whole trailer.|, The part where Mera's dog stepped on a bee sent shivers down my spine.|, Lol I love how they give Amber Herd her spotlight at 2:23 -- I guess they were contractually obligated to give her some screen time here|, I love how Amber Heard, his wife and mother of his CHILD, is in this trailer for a literal half second.|, I'm so excited for this movie!!!"
Archive,Archive | Official Trailer (HD) | Vertical Entertainment,m0J0BwIzURI,1383504,5605,363,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece. In one watch became one of my favourite all time movies. I rank this with Ex Machina. Everybody should be yelling from the rooftops about this film but I never heard of it before 2 hours ago.
This is easily the best movie I've watched for many years.|, This movie is criminally underrated. It was on the Netflix and I decided to watch it and I am glad that I did watch it. It was superb and the ending shook me up. It deserves much more attention and recognition than it is getting now.|, The is an absolutely amazing movie! 10 out of 10! So happy I decided to watch this, the acting and special effects were brilliant. The story line was perfect too.|, I really loved it. Visual was phenomenal, and there were many moments that touched our basic humanity, IMO. Theo did a tremendous job of carrying it for human and AI.|, Brilliant. Yes it is reminiscent of other films but it develops into totally unexpected territory. A real gem.|, Just watched this movie, I thought it was very well done. I think it was better than some of the reviews, the look of the film for the budget is insanely good, and the ending was superb.|, You know it’s a great AI movie , when you empathize for the AI Robots, as much as you do with the human main characters .|, The scene where No.3 wakes for the first time and screams...Jesus that was chilling. And No.2, I've never wanted to give hardware a hug until I saw this film. Stacey Martin really nailed this role in every way.|, Solid work Gavin! My girlfriend had quite a (positive) reaction at the end lol :)  Love your use of practical elements. Curious if the external house / lab was a miniature or DMP.  Anyone who loves Moon, will love this too.|, i am amazed this movie went over my head, i just saw it like 10 minutes ago.....it is brilliant , even a scene as homage to ghost in the shell, the robots carry more emotions than most actors and the cinematography and the music...........and that ending.......wow, this must be movie of the year material, why didn't they talk more about it ? why is there no reviews or discussions of this ? this is future cult classic material."

After Finland I took the overnight ferry from Helsinki to Stockholm. That's also a wonderful adventure you should put on your list if you haven't already done it.

What do I want for Christmas? Mesimarija -- a Finnish liqueur made from Arctic Red Berries.|, Amazing trip! A perfect expedition to get everyone in the mood for the season. What a treat. Happy Holidays to you and the Creative Director and your entire family!|, Hi there,
What a wonderful trip Jeb! As usual you and Suzanne have outdone yourselves!
Thank you for all the pleasure and education that you provide to us.
Peter|, What a fun trip! Love the Santa hat. I was almost in Helsinki last month (for a figure skating competition!) but decided against going. What a lovely country. Thanks for bringing us along on your adventures! Merry Christmas!|, Amazing trip. We spent a week in Tromso (Norway) in 2017, chasing northern lights and it was magical experience. There is something awe inspiring about these northern countries in winter. A true winter wonderland! And let me guess, you’re asking Santa for a time piece to add to your extensive collection! I sure am asking for one!|, I am so happy there is a dog friendly cabin on the Santa Clause Express!!

(2023) Official Trailer - Rachel McAdams",LzRzojHC3iE,22214759,19457,1465,"My mom unfortunaely passed away from brain cancer last year but I disctinctly remember her excitedly buying me this book and having me read when I was a kid in the 2000s just as she did in the 70s. I know we would be watching this together if she was still here, so I'm sure I will for her when this comes out.|, I really love that they chose to keep the story in the original time period it was written in instead of modernizing it. I think modernizing it and tweaking some details to fit that would have worked okay but there's something about keeping it set in the 70's that I think will work better

Also the blonde girl (I forget her name) playing one of the friends is an incredible actress. Her performance on _Secrets of Sulphur Springs_ blew me away and I'm glad to see her getting more work|, I am now 60 years old. I was 8 or 9 when this book came out and it was so unlike anything else out at the time. No other book talked about periods and all the other important things we girls would go through. Then, when I was in high school, Judy Blume wrote Forever and it changed how I felt about boys/dating as a teen. Loved that movie with Stephanie Zimbalist and so glad they are FINALLY making this movie, and like a lot of you so glad they are keeping the 1970s setting.|, I read this book SO many times in my teens...  It kept me sane during the weirdest point in my life!!  And Rachel McAdams is in it as a bonus!!  ❤️❤️❤️|, As a black girl born in the 70s, I was an outcast sometimes because I loved to read. Beverly Clearly, Judy Blume, and Encyclopedia Brown was everything to me. Books kept me out of the bad elements around me.|, I remember my fifth grade teacher reading this book aloud in class. We all got excited when it was “story time.” She gave that book life.😊|, I'm honestly surprised that a movie version of this book doesn't already exist. But I guess it's time. LOL I'm here for it. I remember reading this in fifth grade. Such a good book for young girls to read and realize that all the weirdness they are going through is normal. It will definitely be a good film viewing for today's middle schoolers and for all the millennials, Xillennials and gen-Xers who grew up with the book.|, I picked up this book in the fifth grade. I had read all the ""Fudge"" books by Judy Bloom so I just naturally picked up the next one. The confusion on one girls face in my class as to why I (a boy) was reading this book about a girl getting her period (unbeknownst to me) was hilarious. As I am reading I get to THE part and went to my mother and asked, ""what's a period?"" Being the kind and gentle woman that she was told me all about puberty and even bought me a book on it. That was quite the education day.|, I lost track of how many times I read this book while growing up in the 70s. It’s amazing that it’s taken this long for it to be made into a movie!|, I just saw this movie last night. Fans of the book will definitely love this movie. It’s a charming crowd-pleaser that tackles the complexities of womanhood, religion, and puberty in a respectable manner. One of my favorite movies of the year!"

The ending is nail - biting. Ben Affleck at his best.|, 💜✌Gosh this movie leaves me screaming at the screen.🤦‍♀️ The suspense makes me panic even though I know the ending. 😳 I love when the guy (who never trusted Ben) shows the sketches at the security gate & he speaks their language. My heart is pounding at this point because he really stepped it up! Everyone's faces throughout the movie were tense & you're right along with 'em! I could have never kept that poker face, but it's like OMGee! 🙉Start that plane already! ✈🏃🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️✌💜|, I LOVED This movie when it came out.

Can't wait to go see it! |, The last airport scene was immensely thrilling .|, just saw this an hour ago, and it was brilliant. especially the opening sequence. Ben you've done it again, totally recommend it! |, Wow this movie is 10 years old already. I need to give it a rewatch as I haven't seen it since cinemas. I remember it being really thrilling and Alan Arkin being really funny.|, One of the most riveting, nail biting movies. Absolutely deserved best picture!|, RIP Alan Arkin (March 26, 1934 – June 29, 2023), aged 89

Had to watch it again recently, still a really good movie.|, For people going through comments to decide whether to watch the movie, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Surprisingly well written horror movie.|, I actually dig this. What's creepy is that you are going to face some of your deepest fears or past memories in a very claustrophobic place, surrounded by thousands of old dead corpses|, People don't want to praise this film too much but it deserves a lot of enthusiastic feedback. It's a great movie, not just good for a mocumentary.|, pretty much worth it to watch, love how they make all the mystery in the history match together to fit in one film and make it a horror genre. I don't know what to feel in the end as it was empty and you feel how clueless you are when you experience every horror in the world and suddenly become normal again.|, This film was actually very interesting. Unlike other found footage films where the plot is stupid and makes no sense, this film is so well done although its not true, it is very realistically done. Its more interesting than scary though. I personally love the scene towards the end where the woman is being chased by the satanic men in coats. That was frikken scary.|, Cool movie, almost didn’t watch it because I hate POV movies but it actually did a really good job at making you feel the claustrophobia and hopelessness of being lost and trapped underground. Loved the archaeological part of everything too. Had an sort of an evil goonies vibe|, One of the best for me. I used to dream of crawling into deep long small creepy  tunnels, it turns out there is real place called the catacombs. This movie gives me the chills|, I watched this movie late last night alone and it was freaking amazing. WOW, so mind bending. Jumped out of my seat several times. Yelling at the TV. NO NO, dont go in there, RUN!!! OMGOSH!!!!! So good.|, I watch scary movies literally all the time, you could name a movie and I've probably seen it.

7/10

There were some scenes where it felt that it was little bit too slow paced, but then I got won over by the acting of cast, and how they perfectly portrayed their character's emotions in each scene.

I also liked how the comedic element wasn't  cringey and all over-the-top,  like other films.

For me, it was a great movie.|, Nat Wolff really seems like a very promising actor. It's awesome to see the new generation of great actors come about.|, this movie is actually a lot more devastating than the trailer makes it out to be...had me ugly-crying by the end|, I don't care that I basically just viewed the entire movie, Nat played this out so well and the ending was cute with him near tears. It looks hella promising, I'm gonna need to watch this immediately.|, I am so excited for this film! I'm glad Nat is in more films :)|, This actually looks alright, and could be the best film I've seen Mickey Rourke in for a while.|, Awww look at Nat being all grown up now. He always wanted to be an actor, and look where he is standing now? Can't wait to see the movie!!|, Nat role in every film: a student|, It was a really great movie I cried.

Expect this game to make you cry—not laugh.|, I really hope the future Assassins Creed games follow in the style of this one, even though this is much shorter and was originally a dlc, this is by far the best Assassins Creed game in a very very long time. I LOVE IT|, I’m so excited to explore Baghdad as it was before the Mongols sacked it.  Sad to lose the ability to fight with a shield, spears and other weapons, and loss of archery, but I hope they will bring back mounted combat, and just seeing the Abbasid army at the height of its power makes up for it.  

Don't get me wrong, I like that they're paying tribute to the very first AC game, but I also loved being able to use a bow, shield and melee weapons like spears and axes as well.  I just am glad that they finally decided not to add in two-handed weapons in this time period.  That was my big gripe with Valhalla - having two-handed swords exist centuries before the development of Medieval plate armor.|, I can see the passion and hard work that went into making this masterpiece!
Plz accept a standing ovation from my side! Hats off!|, You always were cinematic UBI, please don’t disappoint.|, Hoping this game sells well and gets good reviews so Ubisoft realises there still are fans that want a classic AC game or at least 'non-RPG' AC game.|, May not mesh with everything in AC Mirage, but I love the inclusion of Shohreh Aghdashloo as Roshan and putting her dead center in the marketing|, This game was amazing!

Definitely a movie for today’s times. LOVED IT|, This movie was honestly so good, if I had to write a film essay on it I’d say it’s as if euphoria and the purge were merged together as an ode to the Salem witch trials. Like Heathers, (the original high school black comedy), I could imagine it becoming a cult classic if it wasn’t so underrated <3|, Fun fact: this is the creator of HBO's Euphoria.|, this is such an underrated movie|, So glad I saw this in theaters, the trailer hooked me and I was hoping it was good. Such an underrated movie. It gripped me with a deep and panicky uncomfortableness that many movies don't give me.|, honestly super excited for this. i miss seeing movies that are made for the sole purpose of having fun. it might not be a cinematic masterpiece but i'll at least have fun going to see it and that's all that matters :)|, back in 2018, i thought this movie was unrealistic. in the beginning of 2021, i now completely understand it.|, I actually feel like this is going to be a cool movie. There is obvious messages behind it and I appreciate the exaggerated but direct attention to the issues going on in our world.|, This movie truly is really dark. Like it made me feel really bad afterwards but it was still kinda good"
Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion,ASTERIX: THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC POTION Clip - &quot;The Romans &amp; Gauls vs. Demonix&quot; (2018),KOJdmpGX5LQ,1786689,18603,426,"I don't know what those elder druids were thinking. Emissive levitation is one of the most useful magic powers one could dream of.|, There is something i love, that i don't think i can explain, about the Centurion getting his game face on, putting on his helmet, drinking the potion, and going at it.|, I have no idea what they were thinking. A super-growth potion is one of, if not the, most useful potion ever brewed|, i just love the fact for one movie, the Romains and Gauls work together on something, even getting to use the potion for (what i assume) the first time. makes this movie all the more special if you ask me.|, I like how Asterix just casually throws the Romans together into a giant centaur battle-mech-thing like it's no big deal|, I’ll never not love the “GET ‘EM!!!” moment.  It’s why I love this series.  The Gauls are all a bunch of argumentative and provincial goofs.  Very much a community of big fish in a small pond.  A lot of wily gossips and complainers.

But they all have big hearts and an underlying love of their community.  And Jupiter help you if you cross them.|, I cant believe the best things about this movie are the new additions specifically demonix/sulfurix and Pectin. They’re both wonderfully memorable characters who I HOPE become cannon and we see more of in future installments. I really enjoy Pectin she’s the little kid character Done Right! She’s always relevant, charming not annoying, serious yet fun smart but still childish. She’s just the perfect blend of this character we’ve seen done to death but with every aspect going above and beyond.|, 0:20 in that shot, for just a moment... His eyes show that Demonix was telling the truth. He really did still see Getafix as his old friend, and gave him one last chance; it was Demonix's failure to accept Getafix's refusal that sealed his fate.|, 1:50 this always gives me shivers on my spines. The breathing and sound when demonix grows.|, A movie well worth watching!  It really brought back the nostalgic feels for me, as I read the comics a lot as a child."
Asteroid City,"Asteroid City - Official Trailer - In Select Theaters June 16, Everywhere June 23",9FXCSXuGTF4,18902393,52816,3051,"This just goes to show how respected  Wes Anderson is in the industry that he can get that line up for one film.|, I love that Wes Anderson continues to use his friends over and over in his films. Watching his filmography is like watching all these actors grow up or grow old. i think its beautiful.|, Wes always nails one thing:  The mundane awkwardness of a normal conversation.  In a way, I think everything about his style of filming (the angles, pacing, color palate) is built around setting the tone for these moments.  We see and feel the uncertainty of one spoken word to the next, and we smile, as we see ourselves.|, I have seen every one of Wes Anderson's films, and he never disappoints.  They are truly bizarre, but in an enjoyable, likable way.  The sets, colors, dialogue, camera angles....brilliant and unique.  There is a REASON every big Hollywood name wants to be in his movies!|, I'm not the biggest Wes Anderson fan but I love the fact that he's continuing to evolve his style. Would love to see what his movies look like in another 20 years.|, My favourite thing about Wes Anderson films is despite the whimsical, almost childlike nature of their aesthetic there is a dark melancholy that permeates throughout the story. Really makes the buttoned down emotions of his characters sing|, Just when you don't think it can get more Wes Anderson, it gets more Wes Anderson.|, I love the filter they add on all of their movies. It adds a cool effect like a retro summer or something. Love it|, Fantastic movie - saw it a few hours ago. It is very different than you think it's going to be, but that honestly made it better. He's a genius.|, 14 year old Wes Anderson fan here! I've seen all of his movies multiple times, and I can't even begin to explain how excited I am for this one. My dad introduced me to Wes Anderson when I was still pretty young, and since then I've really grown to love his movies. Moonrise kingdom is literally my fav movie of all time, closely followed by The Grand Budapest Hotel, and The Royal Tenenbaums. I also LOVE Fantastic Mr. Fox. Okay I just love all his movies. Anyways I'm super excited to see this one!"
Atomic Blonde,Atomic Blonde Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Trailers,JIqcMl0hzXs,764457,8896,692,"If this movie is edited half as well as this trailer, OMG! Whoever edited this deserves an award.
I've always felt that if you're going to use modern music in action movies, and use a bunch of quick jump cuts, you can add to the drama by syncing it up to the music. To me, I feel more presence and less like an audience member looking at a bunch of random shots of action which a lot of movies are now. Syncing to the musice adds a lot of depth and more importantly glue to the scene. Depeche Mode, and New Order just add to the tugging of my heart strings. It looks like it's got a really good cast of actors. Please, let it also have a decent plot, for an action film. Also, John Wicks mom?|, I remember watching this trailer alot and seeing the movie more. Loved it alot ! The action and scenery everythings awesome|, Charlize Theron is such a badass, great choice to cast her in such an action flick. She was so great in ""Monster"". As a fan of ""John Wick"", I can't wait to watch this movie!!!|, ésta película es FABULOSA,  peleas creíbles, bastante reales,  la historia envolvente, un final que no me esperaba y sobre todo el SOUNDTRACK que atrapó mi corazón. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏|, One of my favorite movies of all time!!!  This and Dune|, I don't know what I love more about this move. The soundtrack or Charlize Theron's performance as a badass, gorgeous woman. Yup!!! I am sold on this. ❤❤|, I'm a simple man. I see Charlize Theron and I put a like|, The most deadly thing in this trailer is the music mix. Absolutely killer.|, Charlize Theron is a talented actress👍|, ""Oh, god. I think i love you"". 100% agree. Stunning woman, brilliant actress - it is all about Charlize. 😊"
August: Osage County,August Osage County Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Meryl Streep Movie,9Hd_uO72h1s,3225146,6256,1144,"People with no family issues will probably find this movie boring... But we who can recognize and realte to it seek great comfort in it. It makes us feel like we're not the only ones.. And that's why it's such a great movie. Real and complicated|, I'm ashamed to say how many times I've seen this movie. The entire cast is just brilliant, especially Meryl and Julia.|, One of the best depictions I have seen yet of a toxic, abusive, substance addicted family. Some families are actually worse than this, yes worse. The sibling relationships were actually ""better"" in this movie than many sibling relationships in these kinds of families are. This is because parents who are abusive active alcoholics and abusive substance addicted often scapegoat one child (i.e. use the child as the family punching bag). Once the child leaves (sometimes for good), then the child is replaced by another sibling as the new scapegoat. The siblings then resent each other so much, they can barely speak to each other. Substance addicted and abusive families also have terrible secrets that they bring out during traumatic times (adding to an already devastating situation to increase shock and drama). The dinner table scenes were accurate. 
Chiding a child for being a vegetarian (the child is vegetarian for empathetic reasons) is very accurate too. I have seen it. Empathy is looked at as a weakness in abusive families and empathetic members are used as a laughing stock and derided in this way.
A number of the commentators on this movie deride it as a bullying, narcissistic, blaming miserable movie -- no, it isn't the movie's fault, or the director's fault: it is just trying to show as accurately as possible how these families are. For those survivors of families like this, it is a beginning of a long discussion.
If you are a survivor you will be able to relate to it. If you are not a survivor, you will shake your head and wonder why the world needs to see this. But many don't want to see slavery, or southern lynchings, or the Native American genocide -- but being aware has made the world a better world. This movie can do the same.|, People who saying this movie is boring just hate dramas. Damn this is a hell of a movie and it's worth every seconds of it. I was laughing, bawling my eyes out. If either Meryl or Julia didnt win any Oscar ill bust someone's head into their ass for real.|, Meryl Streep acts like a hurricane, breathtaking, wonderful. Nothing to say, nobody to judge her. She´s the queen. Besides, the whole cast is great, the script works fine and enrolls a sad family story wich goes far back into its past. Great movie. My favorite for Oscars along with Blue Jasmine and Dallas Buyers Club|, Seen this movie 6 times! I'm totally obsessed with it! Simply brilliant!|, This is for sure the best cast in a movie for at least the last ten years. I am addicted to almost everyone in this movie, especially Ewan, Benedict, Meryl and Julia. Can't wait!|, Saw this with some friends and I have to say I love this movie. Julia Roberts is unexpectedly great and so is the rest of the cast. Meryl is great as usual. I loved the lines in this movie too. I also feel like I can relate to it because my mother is crazy. If only I could take control of her like Julia's character did with hers. Unfortunately I just leave her to her own destruction since I can't seem to control her. :/|, Saw this just tonight. I loved it. It exposes the dark secrets and scandal entangled within a very dysfunctional family, but in a powerful and real way that resonates. It's sad yet it's laced with fantastic humour so you'll be laughing and wiping away tears all at once. And all the acting was superb! Special shout out to Julia Roberts-one of her best roles yet! Oscar worthy good. And Meryl Streep was classic. I definitely recommend this if you're in the mood for an UNpredictable no bullshit style drama about love and war in family relations. Even better if you're feeling a little cynical that day.|, This movie was simply AMAZING. Outstanding performances throughout the movie. Those expecting a happy ending, get it out ya head"
Austenland,Austenland Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Keri Russell Movie HD,KbHr8YyjSlg,1397356,4568,458,"This movie was surprisingly good. I loved everything about the dresses, the aesthetic, the Jane Austen theme. Also, Jennifer had an amazing comedic timing as always|, Okay, okay so I adore this movie and I can't understand why all these Austen fans hate it so much! I'm a Jane Austen ADDICT and I thought this movie was hilarious, fantastic, and surprisingly romantic. I was yelling at the screen!|, This was great. Ignore the critics, who maybe are just plain tired of all Austen adaptations period. This is a comedy that knows it's a comedy, and has funny people in the supporting roles as well as lovely eye candy as the stars. You never know exactly what some characters are going to say or do, which just makes it all the funnier. It's a loving send-up of ""I <3 MR DARCY"" pop culture.|, I just watched Austenland, and I'm really happy that I did. It was so romantic and the ending brought tears of happiness to my eyes. :) <3 I recommend this movie to all hopeless romantics (like myself :D)!|, This is an absolutely amazing movie - one of my favourites. It's a westerb reverse harem and is basically a host club filled with Austen stereotypes. Honestly, if there's anything better than a host club + comedy + Jane Austen + Bret McKenzie... I don't think there is. Such a shame it didn't even come out in England, it deserved so much more! (I watched it while I was on a trip to America).|, I am a huge Jane Austen fan and this is still one of my favorite movies! Mr. Nobley ❤|, This movie was honestly really good! I'm a huge Austen fan 😭|, I watched it on Netflix yesterday and I LOVED IT ❤❤❤ The film is perfect 🥰|, Creo que Jane Austen deja huella en toda mujer que se toma un tiempo para la lectura de algunas de sus novelas. Nos brinda la ilusión pero también la oportunidad de saber que en este mundo si existe el amor. Por ahí, no de la forma que uno lo pensaba. Por eso , ese film refleja un poco a cada una de las lectoras que anhelan un Mr.Darcy.|, Oh, this movie, I struggle to find the right words to describe it. It is so sweet and pure. That's a piece of Jane Austen. I highly recommend it, I fell in love with it <3"

I don't think I've ever been so hyped for a movie.|, I was one of the first creature designers who worked on this film (worked on the flying fish/crocodile creatures, the whale creatures, and more with a bunch of other insanely talented people), and I just wanted to say thank you to all of you, the fans. Some of us who worked on the movies do take the time to read through the comments on the trailers, and seeing the overwhelmingly positive response from you all so far has made the YEARS of work that have gone into these films worth it for all of us. Truly, thank you. I'll see you in the theater in December! 💙love from India|, I still prefer this trailer over the new one. More mysterious, spiritual and moving.

It’s beautiful…|, To all the people ""the story is bland"" it's all about protecting family and home. Nothing else matters in life.

The Pinocchio song just fits so well.|, 8 years later…, and this trailer still hits you…

A moment in cinema history that will never repeat itself or even be topped again.
This was a culmination of 20+ movies and 10+ years. Goosebumps.|, 2:08 The greatest moment in Marvel’s cinematic history. The fact Captain America was going to take on an entire Army on his own shows how dedicated he is. It wasn’t the fact that everyone showed up to help, it was  EVERYONE! Everyone was an Avenger that day. The roar of the crowds in the theaters made the scene much more iconic. Truly a moment that will be remembered for generations to come. 💙|, If you saw this in theaters like I did, you are blessed. Our generation will never witness something of this magnitude ever again. The adrenaline rush was off the charts!|, I consider this scene to be the ‘No. I am your father’ for a new generation. This for anyone in the cinema at the time was a crowd pleaser and so much more.

Baby Driver,BABY DRIVER - 6-Minute Opening Clip,6XMuUVw7TOM,90050183,1088503,25532,"After 6 years later... it's still one of the best opening scenes in the 2010s and modern cinema. The thrills, the speed, and the synchronization of the music and the car is everything. It's a nonstop musical that doesn't feel like six minutes of Baby just cruising as if he doesn't need training wheels.|, you know a film is going to be special when the very first 6 minutes are this wild. what a majestic movie|, As someone who has owned some half a dozen Subarus, it's really cool to hear them using the actual boxer rumble and turbo noises. They make it very known that they are driving a WRX, not just some ambiguous import. Really cool to see.|, IMO this is possibly the single greatest opening scene and/or music scene in film. there is so much characterization packed into every part of it and the use of the song combined with the structure and editing is incredible.|, This movie feels like the perfect example of when movies use licensed music.
Sure, other times it's obnoxious (mostly cuz it's just songs that are popular at the time), but the way they use music in this movie is SO WELL DONE. So many different things accommodating the music: The timing, what's happening in the scene fitting the lyrics, the STORY itself-it's so fucking COOL!|, 2:33 is a great clip. The point, the reverse, and the insane corner tracking shot  as he comes around the barricade right into the camera. The camerawork is first rate.|, my friend showed me baby driver because it's one of his favorite movies, and he prefaced it by saying it has one of the greatest opening scenes he's ever seen. He wasn't wrong.|, God I love this movie. Just everything about it. The perfect transitions timing up with the songs, the songs being perfect for every mood, and all the subtle details like the graffiti changing later on, and the camera flash during the car chase. Hats off to Edgar Wright for making a fucking amazing film for everyone to enjoy. Plus this scene alone kills every car chase scene to ever exist. Never will we see better from such an underrated director. I’m just now realizing how much of a ramble this is. But I love this movie.|, In 50 years, people are gonna to look back on this clip just to admire the then classic cars.|, 4:56 Seeing Buddy look so proud of Baby just makes the finale much more heartbreaking."

Such a soul touching masterpiece|, Never have I ever felt so much pain while watching a movie. In the end I cried so much I hardly could breathe. What a powerful art work.|, I agree with everyone here who was touched by this beautiful movie.  One thing I was grateful for: the portrayal of her parents. If this had been a movie full of cliches, they would have portrayed them as being in a cold, distant and loveless marriage, driven apart by their daughter's illness.  AND they also would have been portrayed as having no clue who their daughter was, or looking down on Moses and driven to kick him out of their daughter's life.  But they did not do that, and the movie is all the richer for it.|, This movie not only moved me but it changed me. It’s now my favorite movie of all time. It’s beyond expression.|, This movie is so good! Such nice acting from all of the cast. And so many scenes arising laughter and tears at the same time..and beautiful sceneries around. I liked that they included minor scenes with such beautiful bright birds sitting on a trash-basket. So many significant details if to watch attentively.|, Very good movie.Theres a gentle reminder of human complexity in its most tender form for parents."

Most accurate statement about the western entertainment industry that has ever been spoken. Kudos.|, As a man, I'll be a good sport. But being a good sport is not the same as supporting an ideology that openly hates me. So, I'm not supporting Hollywood financially or politically.|, It's kinda funny, when you think about it. These ""female heroes"" don't need to go on a hero's journey, they always just need to realize they were perfect from the start 
while only showing conventional male traits. So they're telling us in a roundabout way, men are just perfect the way they are 😂|, “Toxic masculine traits are bad…unless they’re present in a woman. Then they’re great.” - Modern Feminism|, Calling men “subhuman” has got to be one of the most evil things I’ve ever read in my life|, It's wild. Disney bought Marvel/Star wars for billions to reach male audiences then turned it into feminist trash. How investors allowed it to go this far is mind boggling.|, Hollywood is still struggling to accept that there’s no such thing as a “modern audience”|, Love the last words in your video: ""This isn't about empowerment it's about dominance."" It's also not about equality anymore. It's about vengeance. It's all a form of social engineering.

No revelation of the suspense at all which makes the curiosity to watch the movie.|, After seeing this movie twice and revisiting this trailer, it’s clear how effective this trailer is at giving nothing away and how cleverly it pulls bits and pieces out of the context of the storyline and put them together in a way that makes you think you’re getting one thing, but end up with something completely different. And that’s how a trailer should be done.|, It's funny how she didn't want to go outside into the neighborhood alone and leave the house but she clearly has no problem with walking into the dark and creepy basement.|, After seeing this movie, (and being 100% confused and grossed out by it) i can confidently say that this trailer was done incredibly well. it gives literally nothing away, it's taken random scenes from the movie and made it seem like its a completely different plot than what it actually is.|, I will watch anything with Bill Skarsgard in it.  The fact that it looks absolutely terrifying and also has Justin Long are amazing bonuses.|, Now, this is how you make a horror movie. It's intense, creepy. It's has a solid plot with outstanding character's that you get attached to. I would say it's one of the best Horror films in the last decade quite easily. Just brilliant from start to finish. If you're looking for a Horror film that's original then this is it. 10/10|, Was that Justin Long I spied in there? Anyone who had the good sense to be in the first Jeepers Creepers is worth trusting that this movie could be dope|, Movie was a great ride. Knew nothing going in and I am so grateful for that. Rare we get to see a fantastic movie and know nothing about the plot. Great acting, terrific music and sound, shot beautifully, writing was solid, funny and anxious.

Batman has a point. How many serial killers in our reality had a tragic and traumatic life like the Joker, but in the end they were born that way and chose the fate they found. Same goes for him.

*Proceeds to flex as hard as he can after finishing every course*|, “You were gassed because you were showboating!” Or maybe because he’s HALF your size and muscle mass, Dwayne - and you’ve got him trying to beat you in a course that’s obviously geared for brute strength.|, The Rock literally takes every opportunity he can to flex|, let's be honest, as weirdly awkward as this scene is, it makes us want to go to gym for the next five minutes...|, Meanwhile some people were drowning and wondering where those life guards are lmao|, “You wanna be a lifeguard you’ve gotta conserve your energy.

Beasts of No Nation,Beasts of No Nation | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix,2xb9Ty-1frw,14385189,80162,4762,"I saw this movie and felt as if I was watching a documentary, which I mean in the best possible way. The story felt so real and the acting which played it out was some of the best I've ever seen.. Definitely a must see.|, It is honestly criminal that the actor for Agu was not nominated for an Oscar. Probably the best performance by a child since The Sixth Sense.|, That kid who plays Agu should get an Oscar.|, I come from one of the Anglophone regions of Cameroon and this felt like an accurate representation of the situation in the Southern Cameroons. The topography of the region, the rebels in the bushes, soldiers summarily executing those they deem to be ""spies"". It felt more real for me having lived through all the gunshots, hovering military helicopters and the UN sitting idly by (just like when they drive past in this movie). And may I say that Idris Elba's accent sounded so genuine. Loved this movie|, The bridge scene is one of the best in movie history. It ascended me to another plane of existence and I had chills the whole time. I was so immersed at that moment that I felt like I was about to take the bridge myself!

Such a powerful movie and score along with stellar performances by Idris Elba, Abraham Attah (the kid) and everyone else in the film. If you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor and WATCH IT!!!|, Best film I've seen in a long while. Agu is perhaps my favorite character of all time. To see his transformation was profoundly sad. This movie was a roller coaster of emotion. A film not easily forgotten, this movie is unlike anything else I've seen in cinema.|, This movie is one of the best I've seen. To know that this is happening around the world breaks my heart, and these child actors are extremely talented. It definitely gave me a lot of emotional feels. 10/10|, I just watched this masterpiece. I don't think I've ever been this physically and emotionally exhausted after watching a film. This movie literally drained me.|, Jakość emocji przekazana w tym filmie jest imponująca|, This movie is amazing had me crying laughing and smiling but didn't give me the ending I was expecting. There's so much happening around the world that we don't know of"
Beasts of the Southern Wild,BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD: Official Trailer,pvqZzSMIZa0,783957,5005,282,"This is one of the strangest but most memorable and powerful movies I've ever seen. The acting was incredible.|, Not only does this movie deserve more recognition, but also the soundtrack.the soundtrack to this film is a master piece|, I feel this movie and ""A Monster Calls"" share a lot in common. Just how we use art and stories and fantasy as way to make ourselves, better, braver. How through our storytelling, we escape the circumstances keeping us down and evaluate ourselves to become heroes. ""Once there was Hushpuppy"" and she was legendary.|, This was filmed in Pointe Aux Chenes, Louisiana.  A very interesting diverse place home to a wildlife management area, Indian tribe reservation (PACIT), residential and fishing camps community,  and some dam awsome blue crabs and salt water fishing.  Pointe Aux Chenes translated ""Oak Point"" used to have thriving oak trees extending into the salt water marshes.  Due to bayous (canals for those that don't speak cajun) being cut through the marsh for oil pipelines over the past several decades salt water intrusion has killed most of the oak trees.  This has created some of the eeire scenery in this movie.  Just a little info for those who are interested.|, I just thought of this movie again when I was recalling the days I lived in NY and would go on solo dates to interesting cinemas. I was lucky to see this film's premiere in the city, and it has stuck with me since as one of the most beautiful, poetic pieces I've seen.|, One of my favorite movies. I cried like a baby watching this.|, my childhood right here...I cannot count how many times I watched this and cried every single time I saw it|, Hands down BEST tear jerker. Great acting. Cant wait for more from this child 💞|, Utterly stunning film.

Beatriz at Dinner,Beatriz at Dinner Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Indie,JJweqjIWtbg,662932,4641,491,"Absolutely wonderful movie, so unique, and Salma Hayek acting is on point!
100% recommend it :)|, I love Salma Hayek, she's a great actress. You fall in love with Beatriz passion, and her ability to speak her mind. But she is a little too intense. This movie was great but it feels incomplete. I never knew who was she talking on the phone with and we never got to know Tara.|, I love films that were shown at Sundance, and I love Salma Hayek and John Lithgow. I can't wait to see this. :)|, There are thousands of ways to end a movie.  

 The writer / director had an invaluable opportunity to close the film with an outcome more transformational and uplifting for the characters, and especially the viewing audience.

🙏|, Wow, this was a powerful movie, although the ending was a total cop out. Some in the comment section are saying that the film has a Liberal vs. Conservative theme. But I don't see it that way. To me, it is simply a story about woman with a high ""Quality of Consciousness"" trying to navigate a dinner party filled with many lower ""Quality of Consciousness"" individuals. I don't see anything political about being a caring human being.|, Nuggets of lessons that I learned from the movie:

✔️Healers are empathic people. They are good at connecting with people and everyone/everything around them. 

✔️They are old souls whose self-consciousness and self-awareness around are high. 

✔️They are usually survivors of trauma.

✔️Their weakness is self-control of their emotions and if they aren't able to master their own emotions, they would usually shutdown themselves or withdraw from a very unlikely situation. 

✔️Healers also need healing.|, I feel same as Beatriz it was by coincidence I watched this film and I couldn’t believe how much we were alike such a powerful film. I absolutely despise trophy hunters and I’m a healer (empath)|, finally a good role for salma hayek.|, Finally,somebody gave my Salma the role she reserved to a great comeback.This is smart,very dark humor and appropiated for this era.She and Lithgow will be serious contenders for cinema awards next year,this movie will be a total success.|, This powerful film is a must-see. This is an extraordinary film, one of the best I've ever seen."
Beau Is Afraid,Beau Is Afraid | Official Trailer HD | A24,PuiWDn976Ek,9622962,143139,9052,"I love when a good director gets popular enough that they're allowed to be weird.|, It really warms my heart to see A24 carve out their little niche and find so much success. This is what I loved about movies. It doesn't have to be one or the other. I want to watch big, dumb superhero popcorn flicks AND be blown away by stuff like this.|, Watched this at the movies last night. Epic. Hectic.
My closest friend had life long mental health issues, and had the same underlying soft loving nature as Beau in this movie. 
I asked him once what it felt like to endure a psychotic episode, and he said  that you absolutely can not distinguish the difference between a thought and something happening in real life. 
A couple of years ago, we went surfing together, I dropped him home afterwards and made plans to surf again the next day. But he woke up, took his board to the beach and walked up to the edge of a 100ft cliff and jumped off, beautiful sunny morning at 9am. 
The weight of what he carried around (and hid beautifully from most of the world) in the background of his mind was a war that was eventually to much to bare. 
There was so many moments in this film that reminded me of moments in time that I’d seen him travel through. 
Amazing movie that blurred the lines between the reality he encompassed and the torture of his anxieties.|, Thank you A24 for continuing to let Artists like this shine. You guys gave me a passion for movies and going to the theater again|, I came into the movie theater blind. I did not know what to expect with Ari Aster's new movie, but it's that level of uncertainty that drew me in even more. I left the theater in awe and somewhat gut-punched. I had to see this movie again! Already can't wait to get it to own on 4K blu ray!!!|, Just got done watching this movie and gotta say that I left the theater completely awe struck and full of joy, questions and theories. Ari Aster’s filmography is the reason I love going to the local movie theater. Can’t wait to see what’s next for this fantastic director, 10/10 from me like his last 2 films|, This is a perfect example of how you do a trailer. You’re not getting a synopsis or plot of the the entire movie, but it perfectly gives you a setting and a vibe. Such a good trailer!|, There are a lot of controversial opinions about this movie. It’s more metaphorical, it represents how to live with anxiety, basically a nightmare of a person with severe anxiety in absurd, black comedic portrayal. 

It’s also about relationships in your life and their importance ( parents, partners etc) and how parents can control you even as an adult, how they planted deep fears into us only to be hindered from reaching our full potential and joy. What it’s like not finding your place in society and feeling like an outcast, not fitting anywhere, but even if you have a chance to live a happy life and find your people, your inner fears, your traumas will come get you and draw you back to the source of every bad thing in your life, mind until you can’t escape and there’s no where to go.

It’s about traumas, fears, anxiety and how they can decrease someone’s quality of life, determine their present and future and how you can be the prisoner of your own mind due to them.|, A24 is by far the best film company. All movies are original. Respect to all directors and writers. The Witch, Hereditary are some of my favorites.|, Ari Aster revolutionized the horror genre. His movies are exactly what i’m looking for in a horror movie."

I remember when the movie came out I’d replay this scene over and over|, nobody will understand how angry i am that this is not on spotify..|, Rest In Peace BlueSky, Disney and Pixar should take notes on their films. It's such a shame Disney shut them down. Personally I feel as if BlueSky films are superior, they put lots of thought into the animations and all of the sound tracks seem to fit perfectly with the animations for example, just listening to this song you could just imagine the animations and feel the emotions flowing from the beats...|, The meaning of the original brazilian song is VERY different!
In the portuguese version, they sing about ""your return brings us joy"" (talking about Jade, in the movie), and how, despite all our (beatiful) color differences, we are all of the same family!
It's a wonderful song that celebrates brazilian diversity and as, despite our population being composed by SO many different ethnicities from all around the world, we all consider ourselves a single giant family! I absolutely LOVE this song! 🥰|, the fact that the song also carries a beautiful message.
even though they are talking about birds it can be taken in the context of humans. we are all different colors and shades but we are all beautiful and are one😌😌|, Man they nailed this soundtrack|, I don't know why but listening to this song gives me a sense of freedom, family, love, and happiness.
The songs just so good.|, This is honestly my favorite song from Rio|, Let's come together, singing love and harmoniaaaaaaaaa
We are so different, but we're the same inside our heeeeeaarts

Becky,Becky Trailer #1 (2020) | Movieclips Trailers,5-j5HtaOSjA,1630705,9743,1442,"I love when comedians play new roles outside what we're used to seeing. I want to see this mainly because of Kevin James begin a bad guy compared to dorky Doug.|, This actually looks good. I'm guessing it's going to be one of those subversive gore-filled satisfying slashers. I remember watching trailers for Ready or Not last year thinking that it looked terrible, but it ended up being one of the best (and most underrated) movies of the year.|, This movie is actually very good. Tripped me out James played a Bad boy. But Becky the lil girl was a nut case!! Loved this movie!!|, This movie is an incredible movie. First, I never knew Kevin James was capable of such a role but I can say the same about many cast members. Lulu Wilson surprised me. She is miles away from the vulnerable character she played when I first saw her (Sharp Objects). Robert Maillet as Apex, he's had many roles as bad guys(nonspeaking) and very memorable. This is the first production I've seen where he delivered lines and he was good. If you enjoy great revenge movies, this one does it on every level. Strictly speaking though, it feels more like an origin story but still checks all the boxes for a revenge flick.|, I love it when comedians do serious roles!|, Kevin James absolutely blew my doors off! Wow! Wild flick 😎|, really liked this movie the few things I would have liked more is 1 explaining what the key was for, 2 not killing Apex because he helped her stay alive I thought she should have spared him since he spared her, 3 a better overall plot.|, Okay, I watched the trailer as a joke and this actually looks really good|, Best performance of Kevin James you will ever see. Comedy to crazy is a hard transition and he nailed it. As for becky!! Wtf!! A 14 year old girl with mummy issues has just gotten herself in the public eye, an amazing performance, some of the best acting from someone so youg as you will ever see. There are sequels to this film, along the Hanna, electra, assassin lines. this girl is your big sister, brother, mother father and the whole police department in one little body.  one of the best films ( and most sick) you will watch this year and more to come  outstanding.|, Wow Kevin James killed it in this role.  I'm impressed.   Good for you I look forward to more villain parts or hero for Kevin. He proved he can do any role."

I just want to see the impact she made on everyone’s lives through that day|, I couldn’t stop crying from the moment she started connecting with her sister and took her out for a walk and then when she realized that she has to be kind and she accepted her death and loved her last day|, This movie explains that we all are gonna die in the end; the difference is that we have options to choose and change things everyday not just to better oneself but also the others.|, *For all of those who never saw the trailer before or heard about the movie: THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE! Go watch it now!*|, Personally this is the most meaningful movie i've ever seen. This is going to change how i see the world and i can say that i will try to be a better person and make my life worth every day|, The music, the weather, the color and the story was weirdly beautiful. It gives me some weird feeling that is now part of my memory.|, Happy to see that so many fans of the book, Lauren Oliver, and Zoey Deutch are in the comments supporting the movie! The comments about it being ""just another time loop storyline"" aren't surprising. To those who haven't read the book, what really made Before I Fall special to me is not only Oliver's writing but how genuine and relateable the story was without all the over the top and awkward high school angst most media tries to sell us now a days. The best thing about Before I Fall to me was how down to earth it was when it comes to concept on how people interact and relate in general, not just in a high school setting. Fingers crossed that the movie is able to capture and maybe expand on what made the book so special.|, This movie is what we all need. Truth to be told, we have the choice to be happy everyday, to do the right thing, to feel good. And somehow we refuse to be happy. In this movie nothing changes, the people are the same, her problems are still there, EVERYTHING is the same the only thing that change was her and she was able to do so much in one day !!!! And be happy.|, This movie is just so amazing and it has life lessons, it tells us the importance of being good and kind to people. I love it, I definitely recommend it. The soundtrack is beautiful too|, 2020 quarantine seemed like a good time to watch this movie, so I finally did...and I gotta say that this is one of the best movies out there, and I think that everyone should watch this at least once in their lives because there is so much meaning behind it..."
Before I Go to Sleep,"Before I Go To Sleep Official Trailer #1 (2014) -  Nicole Kidman, Colin Firth Movie HD",tQdnOYpyBCo,3662252,9321,817,"I've just read the book and must say it's a really astonishing and taking your breath away sort of. What I loved most is that it's an ordinary, quite an ordinary story, despite all the happenings, but still thrilling. Probably the film is going to be at the same catching breath level, which I'd appreciate a lot. But, really, I'd rather that in the film she would keep a journal as in the book, not the one with camera or something. She's been writing it down in pen, after all. For me that's somehow essential, for she writes in the car, or when her ""husband"" is asleep near her, just when he's in bed and she is sitting there in the bathroom. I love the actors now, and the trailer gives a feeling of something really detailed and well-made.|, That was very, very good ! Just finished it. I came for the Firth but Nicole Kidman bloody well steals the show, she's incredible. The film is scary as hell, quite intense, and a real tear-jerker by the end. Prepare the tissues :)|, The book is brilliant. Don't compare this to anything else unless you've read the book or seen the movie. It's a great story. |, Novel is actually good. One cannot put it down and only gets better as the story progresses.|, I haven't read the book, but I gotta say the movie is deffinetely worth watching it.|, Loved it. Ending brought me to tears|, Who else came here after reading the novel? It's suppose to be a journal not a camera but still superb!|, Who else came here from Netflix to decide whether it was worth the watch? |, absolutely loved this book way better than the film the tense was unreal when reading this also surprised at the big twist at the end like didn't see it coming at all really great book would highly recommend|, I never read the book so I found this movie very interesting and intriguing ,the villain was not the person I was  expecting...Great movie"

It be great to see them continue their deep, meaningful conversations.|, Just finished watching this film tonight and how it vividly depicts the way two people maneuver a relationship is so realistic! Utter brilliance.|, That final scene of Before Sunset still makes me gasp. And I've seen it like 40 times. Linklater, Hawke and Delpy are cinematic geniuses! |, Jeez, I can't wait to see this movie!!

Ah, age is settling in like old wine....Love this couple so much and their interactions....ah, no words can describe properly the richness of feeling this little trailer just gave! Julie & Ethan <3|, And I hope it becomes a hit. Tourism always grows in the places where successful films are shot. |, Utterly brilliant film. A honest, melancholy, bittersweet masterpiece and easily the film of 2013. |, I might find this trilogy boring if I watched it as a teenager. I'm so glad I've watched it as an adult. This movie made me feel a lot of things by just watching a couple having a conversation."
Before We Go,Before We Go Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Chris Evans Romance Movie HD,vNzaiGzPoUg,8674691,60219,1389,"Very very under rated movie. You think it's a total love story cliche but it's the opposite and all you want by the end is to be a cliche love story because you feel so so much for these two even after the movie ends. Really hoping for a sequel.  Chris Evans did a phenomenal job for his first time!|, Everyone should see this film, it's simply amazing. It's nothing like these cliché, cheesy romantic comedies. Chris blew me away with this, so proud of him. And I hope to see him direct more films. I love the story, loved the performance, and it's just amazing because it's honest. |, In all seriousness, this movie was so beautiful. The simplicity of the shots and angles were just so perfect, the acting was wonderful and the storyline just made it so much realistic. I loved the movie, it’s definitely not what I expected|, I don't know why many gave this movie bad reviews, I thought it was great and genuine. Love both Chris' and Alice's chemistry here. I think the ending was perfect for this kind of movie, but sometimes I wish they would make a sequel just so I could see both of them again lol. And props to Chris too for great directing!|, This is one of my favorite movies ever. It's just a beautiful story about two strangers that met by chance and decided to help each other. And the one night they spend together is just magical, really. If you're considering to watch this movie.. I'm telling you, do it! You will not regret it.|, Saw this movie, it stuck with me for a long time afterwards. Something you could really feel touch your soul. Two people who help each other resolve some issues and find a deep connection. Very beautiful.|, Who doesn't love Chris Evans? He's such a humble, funny, good-looking guy with an amazing personality. Chris is a great actor, he'd be good in other action/thriller movies not just Marvel. |, ""There is no perfect, there will always be a struggle. You just got to choose who you wanna struggle with.""|, This movie was SOOOO good ! I watched it and the next day watched it again and I never get sick of it ❤️ it's so beautiful it makes my stomach hurts|, Everyone should see this film . Chris Evans is phenomenal in this ! He needs to direct more films too because this is just great"
Before the Sunset,Before Sunset (2004) Official Trailer #1 - Ethan Hawke Movie,oI3UuneLcyU,2537577,8766,381,"''I guess when you’re young, you just believe there’ll be many people with whom you’ll connect with. Later in life, you realize it only happens a few times.'' Rarely have I found a line from a film so devastating and profound.|, This movie was magical. It was a boring story about two people but it was so much more. How their relationship evolves through the film is amazing. The acting is so effortless and really portrays the energy of two absolute strangers. The way they share these deep experiences and poetic conversations makes the movie so enchanting. This is what a romance movie should be like it’s surreal at the same time realistic. I loved this movie mostly because of the boring yet poetic and deep conversations they had through it.|, The dialogue and acting in this trilogy is on a whole other level...magnificent.|, Love this trilogy. I guess the ones who really like it might have had an experience such as the one that played out in the first film. The films give you a sense of those emotions that you had. Not necessarily to rekindle that feeling for that person, but solely for the feeling alone. A nostalgic tender happiness, with uncertainty floating around it. This film can let me people plug themselves into the characters, imagining how things could have had that fantasy romantic encounter.|, Guys, the Before Sunrise trilogy is based on a real life experience that the director Richard Linklater had in 1989. There is a video here on YT telling the story of how Richard randomly met a young girl named Amy Lehrhaupt in a toy store in Philadelphia I think, and they had the same connection, talking about things and life and so on... So he told her that he was going to make a movie about it, and actually did 5 years later. He hoped that she would show up to a screening realising that he had kept his promise, but unfortunately she had died in an accident 3 months before he started filming the movie, which he didn't know about until much later (a friend of Amy's sent him a letter informing him about her passing). The story is so heartbreaking but it gives all the more power to these magical movies. This was all detailed in Jeff Rowan's video here on youtube. <3|, You know that a movie is amazing when you're just watching but suddenly you feel like you're actually there with them, sitting beside Celine and Jesse having a conversation. This movie was amazing. So authentic. Acting 👏 Story 👏 DIALOGUE 👏👏👏|, 1. Before Sunrise :- Most romantic 🥰
2. Before Sunset :- Most Emotional 😢
3. Before Midnight :- Most Realistic 😇|, For me this film was perfection. 80 minutes of flawless dialogue acting. One only 4 films I've given a 10/10.|, This is one of the my most favorite movies ❤ the way they look at each other throughout, is just magical, there's pain and longing but also hope, some of the finest acting ❤ at one point I forgot this is a movie, and felt like I was just watching these two strangers whom I'm come to love, just live their lives on a summer afternoon together... I can only hope for a love like this ❤|, This trilogy touched me so much...one of the best movies I've ever seen...amazing...just amazing"
Begin Again,Taylor Swift - Begin Again,cMPEd8m79Hw,203508583,1265672,60035,"I love the fact she keeps saying ""I do"" like in weddings. It's like even though she's been treated badly, she's still hopeful for love, still believes in it|, This song may be 10 years old. But for us it never gets old.|, New artists nowadays doesn't sing songs like its a story waiting to be unfolded as the song ends. I love how Tay delivers every song that is relatable 🥰|, Such an underrated song, I love it. Feeling like this with someone new after being treated so badly in the past. It's so scary but amazing at the same time.|, I will listen to this song a million times until it reaches a billion views I promise|, This is one of my favorite songs of Taylor Swift. I dreamed of going all the places she has been into this mv 12 years ago and now I am in Paris!! I always play this song whenever I take the metro line 6 Etoile/Nation to see the Eiffel tower from the train window in between PASSY and bir-hakiem. The only thing missing, is to meet a special someone over a drink in a café or bars which is hard to find without using applications|, Taylor swift is the type of artist that has a song for literally every life situation, that's mad talent right there|, I can’t get enough of this song one of my favorites by her|, Fiancée always said this song reminded her of me, so I proposed to her with it in the background. This song makes me so emotional every time now :') I'm so thankful she said yes!|, My favourite song❤"
Beirut,Beirut - The Rip Tide (Official Video),sX7fd8uQles,8563070,51948,2009,"Amo esta música!|, My dad and I used to sing this in his car together, it's one of his favourite songs ever. It hurts seeing your parents get older, I hope we can sing it together soon again. He's not dead I just moved very far away. So now this song makes me cry everytime I listen to it, knowing everytime I visit home my parents have gotten older.|, After 11 years don't resist to put in repeat for some more days!! Love this song( and band) so much! 🖤🖤🖤|, Essa música fala sobre esperança.  como outras musicas do Beirut, o cenário por onde a historia da musica é contada é o oceano. analisando um pouquinho a letra:
O autor comenta sobre sentir-se só e sobre ser um desconhecido. A temática da esperança entra no refrão, quando ele diz que em breve vai chegar a onda e ele vai encontrar a ""rip tide"" que é a correnteza que leva para o oceano, distanciando da praia.
É uma música sobre aquele momento de espera na vida, onde a gente tá querendo encontrar a 'próxima onda', a rip tide pra carrega o corpo pro oceano, pra navegar nor mar e experimentar a viagem da vida. 
Essa música é remédio para quem tá perdido: pode demorar, a gente se sente só, mas uma hora a direção, o vento, ,a onda, a maré, a correnteza, o empurrão, sejá lá qual simbólico vc preferir, uma hora isso vai chegar e o barco vai velejar.|, I met Zach in Paris one year ago. I was with my mother and I told him we came from Spain just to see them play live. Is my mom's favorite band, and I made a present to her. I told him Rip Tide was our fav song. 
Zach was so kind with us, and the night of the concert, before they start playing, he dedicated the song to my mom and I, in the middle of the theater. My mom started crying. What a great experience.|, Há 3 anos, meu psicólogo me perguntou durante uma sessão, qual música vinha a minha cabeça, quando eu estava triste, me sentindo só e respondi essa... Me trazia um misto de sensações. Vontade de sair sem destino, de ficar e vencer as tempestades, de viver as dores... O barco que me representava! Enfim, o poder da música! E essa em especial, me levava aos extremos em 4min33s. Hoje, consigo sentir uma única sensação, e é de paz.🙌🙏🌻💛|, This band is able to keep the balance between happiness melancholia and sadness in their songs. That's the reason why i like their music so much. It brings you up and it keeps you thinking about beautiful moments in the past. But it doesn't really pull you down. The perfect mixture :-) Keep it up beirut!|, Toda vez que eu ouço é uma experiência diferente! As várias formas de sentir essa música me enche de emoções que pouco sei descrever.|, Quatro anos escutando essa música e ainda sinto as mesmas coisas... de longe, minha música favorita.|, I heard Beirut by the first time on an underrated online radio many years ago in a foggy and rainy afternoon. It was an afternoon I still remember. I downloaded  some tracks and put them in my old MP3 player then I went out for a walk. Just walked under the rain."
Belfast,BELFAST - Official Trailer - Only In Theaters November 12,Ja3PPOnJQ2k,6217938,15448,940,"Caitriona Balfe is a phenomenal actress. Glad she's receiving the high praise she deserves. 👏⭐🏆|, This feels like Kenneth Branagh's most personal film. I can feel the love and passion in every shot of this and it's only the trailer.|, I absolutely loved this film. So touching, so beautiful! Everyone acted brilliantly, especially the little boy.|, Judi Dench’s words of “go now…don’t look back…” gives me goosebumps. This film looks really good|, I’m so happy for Jamie I hope he gets some recognition for his acting!! Hope the entire movie gets an award it looks like a great movie!!|, My Aunt Mary is in this. Took her 15 years to get onto the big screen but she finally made it. Well done Mary 💪👏👏 She’s the teacher in it 😁|, I just watched this on my flight to my second home, which is 5000 miles away from where I was born and raised... I don't know if the planes bring you closer to the God or something, but this touched me really deeply and brought back so many childhood memories... Grateful to everyone who made this beautiful piece of art possible!|, Just watched this film today at the Toronto International Film Festival. I'm always a sucker for a good coming-of-age story, but this one was by far one of the best I've seen. It's an artistic film that really immereses you in the perspective of the boy (outstanding performance by the young Jude Hill) as he struggles to navigate both conflict within his family and that of the early years of the Troubles. Kenneth Branagh was actually here for a talk-back afterwards and I could really feel that it was a very personal project for him, inspired by his own childhood experiences. The film also has a uniquely haunting soundtrack brilliantly balanced with bits of humour. The choice to present it in black and white was also an excellent move by Branagh. Outstanding performances all around, but Catriona Balfe's in particular stood out. Wanted to rewatch it as soon as I left the auditorium. Much more to dissect!|, I can't wait to see this movie. I love Caitriona  Balfe, she's incredible on Outlander. And Jamie Dornan,  has been needing the right role to show what an incredible actor he really is (Like he did in The Fall. ) This film looks like it could be his time to finally shine!! And with Branagh at the helm, I bet the movie is as good as it looks.|, I’m fortunate enough to have grown up in Belfast post-peace process, and I showed this trailer to my mother who was usually very skeptical when it came to movies about the troubles- she said it’s like they’ve taken the memories in her head and put them onto film. 

Seriously, even if you’re not from Belfast; you’re not going to want to miss this. 
At least it’s not got Brad Pitt in it this time!"

Lots of great performances but Julia Roberts was phenomenal… gonna take my mum out to lunch tomorrow and hug my daughter extra tight after watching this. 

I laugh sometimes that my daughter will grow up thinking how boring her dad is, not knowing the insane life I lived for 20 years… tragic that so many people never survive or get that second chance. For me, this is the bonus round.|, Julia is just one of a kind. Once in a lifetime actress! She brought me to tears! A MUST WATCH!|, ""Just tell me son, where you want me to bury you?"" is one of the most heartbreaking thing for a mom to say to her child and Julia Roberts just nails this scene. Oscar Award for best actress for 2019 should already be reserved for her now!|, This trailer hit me to the core. Reminds me of my 22 year old brother. My heart goes out to anyone else in this position. You are not alone.|, An amazing masterpiece film , gets you emotionally locked in every second , you feel the pain of them both and the struggle , may god help the people suffering that pain ,|, Movies like this that show the human side of addiction, I applaud!  Addicts (and their families) are real people,  not the vermin our culture makes them out to be...there but for the grace go all of us!|, Julia Roberts never will be less than an amazing academy award worthy actor in every thing she do 
we should feel lucky we still have her with us.|, I just watched the movie without watching the trailer or knowing what it was about. I saw Julia Roberts, and I knew I had to watch it. It brought back memmories and feelings that feel so fresh again. My exhusband is a recovering addict, and this movie made me sob like I have not in years. Many of the scenes were like a replay of what I, and others have gone trough. I often felt I would wake up to ugly news. I chased him in the car, looked for him on the street and parks, and freaked out when he locked himself in the bathroom... I felt scared for him and myself. We had a newborn daughter, and because of her and the love I had for her father, I left our home (for safety), but stayed around to support him and to wait for the day he would finally get clean. Today, our daughter is 7 and he has been clean for almost 5 years. Though we are not together, I will always love him as a friend and the father of my only child. Those of you who are struggling, stay strong. We believe in you!|, This story hits homes in America all too often.it's sad how one person alone could destroy and turn a family upside down because of addiction. Great movie and we can teach our little ones what the tragic and trauma that drugs have on a family. What a mother and father would do to help the loved ones that are in need of their addiction.|, Lucas hedges acting is so unbelievably underrated. He needs to be in more films fr, he did such a beautiful act in honey boy aswell. A gifted one 🧡"

He died in 2020 at the age of 93.|, The Centurion's reaction i spot on. He is not shocked or scared or threatened, he has a look of pure realization on his face, like something has been made clear to him, like he just woke up and can't fathom that he had been dreaming all along.

It's as if he is more than just looking into Jesus, he is also looking into a mirror and seeing himself and the world very clearly for the first time.|, As a teenager I sat in the theater on my first viewing of Ben Hur and just sobbed uncontrollably at the compassion so elegantly portrayed in this scene.  60 years and hundreds of viewings later, it still brings tears.  Bravo.|, I love it when Ben touches his hand afterwards so gently. He doesn't know why, but he knows that he has to. The soldier looks at Jesus and is humbled, embarrassed and ashamed.

Great writing|, What an absolute classic of a film ! People really put their souls in making movies back then.|, My mom told me that she went with my grandma and great grandma to the cinema and half of it was crying hard at this scene ...  Pure power."

Still, this one wasn't too convincing.|, Invisible things circulate around a couple: fart molecules.

I liked her movie, Somersault and I've followed her career since.  She has a special talent.  I like certain themes, she seems to focus on hands and certain physical movements that really project the emotional feeling of the scene.  And water.|, I just love Max Riemelt. Such an amazing actor.He is so good in this. As he is in everything. Loved him in Free Fall and of course Sense8.This is a great movie|, I just bought the movie today.

It's not just a love story but a statement about culture and society and our inability to get past the racial divide.|, I've been in love with Gugu since she played in the short-lived Undercover's.

Get your tissues ready.|, I always wanted a movie about his life, especially his comeback were he became heavyweight champion at 45. His story is super inspirational|, I got goosebumps when they showed the fight with Ali and Moorer.  These are truly the greatest moments in boxing.  I am very glad that a film is being made about George Foreman.  It is high time.  This is one of my favorite boxers.  And his story is truly amazing.  To regain the heavyweight title after 20 years, and also to take into account the fact that he trained with Sony Liston himself.  Marvelous.  I am very glad that he is still alive and that he himself will be able to watch this film.  Many people around the world will be waiting for this film (for example, I am from Uzbekistan).  A real WORLD champion.|, One of the greatest sports achievements in History is what George Foreman accomplished. It is one thing to go through the intense training, running, dietary demands, rest schedule, weight training, sparring, etc etc etc at 19 years old. But to recapture the heavyweight title of the world at 40+ years old is A PHENOMENAL achievement! Absolutely stunning, particularly if you have more than a casuals observation of the sport. George is the last of the 3 great heavyweights of his era still alive and should be considered, at this point, a very precious resource. He also sings btw, and not badly, and spoke of releasing some music soon. I will DEFINENTLY see this movie!|, Big George is the definition of doesn't matter how long you take to get back up as long you get back up and keep fighting through your hurdles, you are stronger than you will ever know can't wait to see this movie 👏🏼|, Big George is a legend. One of the hardest hitters in boxing, with a crazy comeback story|, Im so glad that George Foreman has his own movie, his story is so inspiring. Most of the people think that Foreman ends in ""Rumble in the jungle"" when that was only a chapter. If anyone deserves love from the Boxing fans is George.|, One of the most remarkable sportsman in history. His story absolutely needs to be told.|, With everything George did, lost, then overcame greater than when he started, I will always think of him not as ""the greatest"", that meme has been taken, but rather the ""Greatest of All Time"".  Such an amazing man and amazing life both inside and outside the ring.|, Can't wait to see this movie with my 21year-old son.

Love your videos thank you for sharing them all with us.|, I can't thank you enough for these videos. Living in Connecticut, it's never easy to get back to California. But I have been there 11 times and after watching this one I was right back at my favorite place, McWay Falls. I had a local artist do a painting from a snapshot I took back in 2011. I treasure it as I treasure every minute of your amazing videos!|, Used to live in Monterey and Big Sur was the backyard. I miss the long lazy drive on the PCH. It is unquestionably one of the most, if not the most beautiful coastal drive in the world.|, Thank you. I've been waiting for you to do Big Sur, and you didn't disappoint!  You brought back wonderful memories of when I've driven it myself.  I've also stayed at Ragged Point Inn twice.  The last time was several years ago when I wanted to show the west coast to my eastern-seacoast-raised late husband. I'd mapped out a route where the first sight of the Pacific Ocean was as unobstructed as possible.  When he pulled over at the first viewpoint he started to say ""it's a good thing I'm used to pulling over for scenic .....Oh. My. God.""  Yes, he interrupted his own comment as soon as he saw the Pacific!  

We stayed at Ragged Point Inn that night.  When we got to our room, there was a window covering the west side of the room with sliding glass doors. You could just sit on the bed watching the sunset.  

Thank you again for these very well done videos.|, Revived memories of our trip there about three months ago. The PCH is probably the most scenic route in the world. Earlier I thought Cape Town has the most scenic road view when driving to the Cape of Good Hope.

Notable is the energy of the father and admire the respect that the son gives to his father.|, Thanks for the time stamps.  I always appreciate when people do that.  Also, thank you for sharing your pleasant day in our beautiful area. Please come visit again.  ❤|, I've done the drive 6 times in my life. One of my friends saw the pics I had taken, and decided to check it out while they were in Cali. They thought it was beautiful, but their fear of heights definitely impacted their enjoyment! I had never mentioned it because heights are a bonus for me, and didn't realize that others might not feel the same!|, I’ve used your videos to plan so many trips now!  You’ve really enriched our travels!  Thank you!|, These guys did a GREAT job capturing the essence of the Big Sur coastline..|, Absolutely beautiful scenery.Reminds me of the parts of Byron Bay,Australia in many parts."

Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter still have great chemistry together and it’s intermittently funny and even profound to watch them as two middle-aged men still trying to hold on to their youth. They both are what make this sequel work at all. It’s definitely more than a mere nostalgia cash-in.|, The fact that Keanu can still do the voice is the funniest thing I've ever heard|, I must say, I enjoyed every minute of this. My wife and I were cracking up the entire time. These two guys did a fantastic job seeing that this sequel has taken so long to create. Very well done and I dare say this may be the best one. 

Highly recommended!|, that was painfully awesome|, Seeing these two together again is pure Magic I can't wait to see this, these guys have been a huge part of my childhood I'm so thankful I was born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s Party on Dudes!!!|, Just watched the movie. Excellent! The movie captured the soul of the 2 previous movies. Wacky as needed, charming as needed, even downright silly when needed. Carried out expertly by the 2 leads. Also carried out expertly by the 2 daughters...perfect casting choices. And of course praise for the writers.|, Brigette Lundy-Paine is great in this film, even outplaying Keanu Reeves with the Logan mannerisms in the body language: Never overdone, just perfect in every facet and nuance. You forget they are acting, it feels as if these two were really related. That's so amazing!"

- Great Picture
- Great Story
- Great Directing
- Great Dialogue 
- Great Acting 
- Rewatchable 
  That's it 
 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟|, I love this movie and here's why. If you pay attention, it literally speaks to the audience. It indirectly breaks the fourth wall, especially during the 'Birdman' monologues. People who dislike this film more than likely want plot, action, CGI, or all three. To make a movie with little to none of those aspects while making it look as if it was done in one shot is sheer genius. Definitely deserved Picture of the Year and possibly actor for Keaton's performance (yes Gyllenhaal was purposefully snubbed; you can't just overlook his excellence in Nightcrawler). I've already said too much but if you're into art and theatre and excellent films, watch this! If you're not open-minded and need other things besides great story, cinematography, and acting, look elsewhere.|, I love how people expected an actual superhero movie.|, Best movie of 2014, by far, no questions asked. The cinematography is amazing, the acting is phenomenal (heck it's the only movie I've ever taken Zach Galifianakis seriously), the storyline is surprisingly great, and the musical score was outstanding. No amount of adjectives I can think of can justify how great this movie was, best movie of 2014.|, Just seen it. It's bloody great. Really deep and inspirational, and yet at the same time fun to watch. Well deserved 4 Oscars.|, I followed this film through its last stages of production to the cinema and saw it in cinema and I loved it. Probably now on my list of favourite films. As soon as it was nominated I was pretty happy.

I swear everyone goes mental when a film is nominated. Like, people suddenly criticise the film's slight mistakes or little things that they disliked about it, and it suddenly overpowers the film's overall greatness.

Oh shit, and now it received the Oscar for Best Film. This is where all of these ""critique""-like comments are coming from saying how bad the film was. Have you even seen it? Did you go to see it with an open mind? Do you understand the film's themes and the unique way it was filmed?

Jesus Christ, people will give anything to put down a film that is nominated, just like actors and actresses nominated for an Oscar.﻿|, I love this movie so much, great cinematography, great cast and great story. I think there is a comedy in this movie if you can catch it in some scene. The most things that impress me is the unpredictable ending and the message that we cannot be such a selfish and arrogant person|, This is probably one of the greatest films ever created. I just want y'all to know that as a person in the film and theater industry this was the greatest 'fuck you' to the status quo that could ever be so ellegantly created. It was a perfect film. Hard to come by in these times.|, Edward Norton killed it. Bravo acting.  Especially the chemistry between him and Michael Keaton. They gotta do more films together.  That all the female actresses,  crazy good.  Oh and the cinematography , ridiculously good. The list goes on, great movie...I meant play,lol."
Birds of Passage,Birds of Passage (2018) | Official Trailer HD,QV0uWf72ZQw,449259,1380,72,"Just saw this in theaters. First, it's beautifully shot and has such a sense of time and place. The use of wide open, remote locations as well as dense rainforest environments made it feel like these people existed in an otherworldly vacuum. Their limited interactions with the outside world, aside from a few brief meeting with gringos, enlarged and heightened the narrative about their historically insulated world.

Second, the themes of the story are front and center, and draw heavily upon Greek tragedy and the old testament. These themes, which include Greed, Revenge, and Lust, lend a universality to the characters which transcends time and place.

Third, the story is told with a deliberate almost meditative pace. In terms of the way it feels, the film is something closer to Malick's The Thin Red Line than a movie like Blow or the show Narcos.

Overall, it's a very good movie. Is it great, a masterpiece? I wouldn't go as far as to say that. But it is worth checking out nonetheless as I suspect a lot folks will feel it is time well spent.|, Resulta muy interesante como se muestra la relacion de la cultura guayu con los inicios del narcotrafico en   la costa caribe colombiana.|, A  beautifully made movie that captures the essence of the Wayuu culture|, Excellent movie...Hope it makes it to the Oscar final five !!!|, Watched it today.

It's not just a movie with an actor imitating but actually portrays who Bruce Lee was.|, worth watching, fight sequences are awesome, love this movie|, Bruce lee was a man of legends I do hope this film does him justice"

This movie is visceral in more than one way. Mothers and daughters all the way through.|, This is a hidden gem. Well written and great performances|, Saw only one showtime listing at a theatre near me at like 1pm and didn’t know anything about the movie at all and I’m so glad I made the rare decision of seeing a movie by myself because I really enjoyed it. I’ll definitely be spreading the word|, Just saw this tonight.  I loved every minute. So many excellent twists and intellectual conversation points.  Not to mention two very strong performances.  I'll have to revisit it down the line.  Warning though, it is very graphic at times.  Not gratuitously, it's just medically accurate.  Which, given the subject matter, should be a hint.|, One thing I just say about this movie is it is outstanding. The struggle of two women meets in one point & it was absolutely brilliant.|, caught this movie on a whim at the theaters, and absolutely loved it. this is the new Barbarian, an excellent, depraved horror movie that comes out of nowhere|, I just watched this 👀 All i can say is a mother’s love is untouchable. Most moms will go to the end of the eart for their little ones. At least most of us will.|, Marin Ireland is quietly incredible. I wish we could have seen more of her Y The Last Man character arc.|, Terrifying on so many levels. It's like a slightly plausible, feminist-gone-crazy Re-animator. I watched it without even seeing the trailer or reading any reviews and was riveted AND disgusted AND terrified to witness the depravity some works resort to to bring back a loved one.

This movie brought tears to my eyes countless times, you can see the genuinity. 
Thank you!|, As someone who is Ukrainian and loves my countries history. The English accents dont bother me one bit, and they should not bother you. I am glad that the makers of the film choose to produce it in English because this way it reaches a much larger audience than if it was made in Ukrainian. Plus more people would be willing to watch it this way, rather than having to read subtitles or hear people constantly speak English with rough accents.|, I'm so sorry for such a horrific tragedy  in Ukranian history! People of Azerbaijan will always support you no matter what! 😰🇺🇦🇦🇿|, My grandma survived this. She told me that there were no leafs on the trees, no rats, cats or anything else on streets, cause people ate whatever. And after that she was shipped to Germany to work in the factory and survived that too. We will once again survive what's happening to us now! 🇺🇦|, I’m Ukrainian and.. I’m totally shocked 😮 EVERYTHING IS TRUE 😱😭 Everything is shows like my grandmother told about her past, about those years .. oh God... those eyes, clothes, everything... I’m crying. I have visited the past of my country as it was, because of this video.. amazing...... 😱😭|, This is an important film that sheds light on a terrible genocide.  The world should hear this story.|, when I saw the idea of the film-I immediately felt proud and grateful ones again for being Ukrainian. so great we are living in the time of truth and openness of history. priceless the fact that all this is highlighted. it has the great importance.
in hopes for everybody to see how proud, free, strong and divine Ukraine is.|, this gave me the biggest chills I have had watching a trailer EVER! I started tearing up and everything|, IM UKRAINIAN !!!!!! I pray for those who died during this period..."

He’s rapidly turning into one of my favorite actors|, The way Adam Driver turned around hella slowly and giving him that look like “Is he really saying this?”🤣🤣💀💀|, I would’ve never known by looking at him, that this dude is Denzel Washington’s son, but there’s no mistaken, he’s got his father’s voice.|, “Did you just use your real name?” 
Had me DEADDDDDD!|, His ""white guy"" voice is spot on.|, I like how the real reaction comes when asks him did he just use his real name, as if they were aware of what he was already doing, but the name question was the real worry|, I remember I first read about this case more than 10 years ago, and was blown away by this officer's audacity.  What's more, though, is he gained respect not only from people he was protecting, but people he was investigating and prosecuting.  He made a real difference in the world.|, Using his real name might have been an amateur move....but damned if he still didn’t pull it off.

The rock trained so hard for his role so he could fly and survive explosions, what an inspiration.|, The scene where Black Adam said ""it's about drive it's about power we stay hungry we devour put in the work and the hours then take what's ours"" i fell into tears|, 0:54 Doctor Fate is definitely gonna be a standout. Hopefully they don’t nerf him too much 😭 finally seeing him on the big screen is a dream come true|, After seeing it...
I say that Pierce Brosnan deserves a solo Doctor Fate movie.
Best thing about this film IMO|, Just watched this last night and although I found a few of the side characters a bit annoying to say the least, the Rock was amazing in the main role. I love to see a darker super hero who really gives the bad guys what they deserve. The action scenes were brutal and probably the best I’ve seen in a super hero movie.|, I love Black Adam's energy. Can't wait to see him face off against Superman.|, Having Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam must be a real honor, especially since The Rock really nails the role of the protagonist.|, ""Heroes don't kill people."" ""Well I do!"" 
Ah finally! A hero that isn't a villain, just plain honest. It's nice for a change tbh|, Fun fact : 
If you watch the scene where Black Adam catches the rocket in 0.25x speed. You can his movement from the car to catching the rocket.  A nice little touch up make it actually look like he's fast and didn't seem like teleportation.|, Pierce Brosnan is perfectly cast. Rooting for his own Doctor Fate movies"
Black Christmas,Black Christmas 1974 1080p BluRay H264 AAC RARBG,kQ2CnQeRCf4,290465,5899,871,"The fact that you never find out who the killer is or why he kills people mixed with the creepiness of the phone calls where he constantly brings up someone named Agnes (presumably his baby sister) leads you to believe that there's a bigger story involved, but not knowing is what truly makes this film terrifying. You would think it would all be explained in the end but it isn't, and as the film ends you hear the phone ringing and you know he's still there, hiding in the shadows, you're left with more questions than answers. Truly one of the greatest, most expertly crafted horror films ever made.|, Before “Halloween” and “Friday the 13th”,there was this  little gem. Everything from script, casting , directing, soundtrack etc.... A+|, There’s just something so atmospheric and strangely Christmassy about the vibe of this film despite it being about a horrendous serial killer - the dim lights, the booze, party,  the carol singing. For me, it’s the pace and feel of this film that makes it an absolute classic and unique.|, I love how at 1:24:34 Jess doesn't do the stereotypical horror movie scream. She is simply in shock. It seems more realistic imo.|, Still one of the most chilling horror flicks, and one of a handful that actually frighten me.|, holy cow, this is outstanding for something released in 1974. Everyone plays their roles really well. The sound, camera movement, angles, are all very well done. Smart characters. Omg and I just learned it's Canadian, =O this has become a new favorite|, Black Christmas is a masterpiece of the horror genre. It's skillfully directed and acted, and consistently scary and suspenseful. Everything feels thought out and purposeful, almost orchestrated. I think it’s superior to Halloween, which Carpenter himself has said was influenced by this film.|, The camera work in this film is INCREDIBLE!! I just saw this for the first time and I am 25, been a horror fan my entire life.. Such a shame this is a deep-cut horror film that doesn't get the credit it deserves, easily one of the most underrated horror movies of all time! Black Christmas '74  is now added to my list of holiday classics lol.|, It’s the fact how “normal” he sounds after the first phone call when he says “I’m going to kill you” that gives this movie so much momentum .|, Not enough people are talking how hilarious Barb is. 32:44

Brilliant film 👌🏼|, Johnny Depp’s most underrated film he’s starred in|, I just saw this movie. Very well done. And Depp is amazing as usual.|, This is the scariest Johnny Depp I have ever seen....|, I saw this movie and it was really good.  it has this theme music in most of the scenes that tells you ""this is not going to end very good.""|, Johnny acts is so brilliant on this movie that you literally wouldn't want to be 2 kilometers close to this Whitey Bulger.|, This movie is badass lol. I’m stumbling upon it years later. After all these actors have blown up, and now I hear them with a standard Boston accent, awesome. I’m a big Fallout 4 fan and just found out a ghoulified mobster character is based off Whitey, Eddie Winter.

Edit: Kevin Bacon was probably my favorite accent of the movie. John Connelly is a real one, atleast in this movie, idk about the real guy lol movie seems to be a bit fluffed up from the actual story I read.|, Oscar worthy  movies..Johnny Depp is scary mean in this film..he truly played whitey to a tee..it's been very under rated"

I knew when I saw that Casi Lemmons (Eve's Bayou) was the director it was going to be good. It was way better than good. Truly outstanding and masterful from start to finish. Can't say enough good things about it. Go see this one!|, Moving and underrated holiday flick! I've seen it twice last time being the morning before Thanksgiving in honor of Ms. Blige's role of the Wicked Witch in the Wiz Live.

Thank you.|, *Loved the transition from ""No Woman No Cry"" to ""Alright""* 🎶|, Words can't express how astounding and phenomenal this movie was. You have to experience it yourself. Wakanda Forever ✊🏽|, This movie hits harder when you’ve had someone in your family pass away from cancer. My dad passed away last year December 21st. At the beginning credits with Chadwick, it was already over for me. I could barely focus the rest of the movie.

Oh Marvel, I cannot wait for this to release!|, Some will may say he wasn't there, but he was always there. Rest in peace our king.|, I gotta admit I went in with low expectations but there was no cringe or forced scenes at all it was just all raw emotion of dealing with the death of a loved one and how to move on. The tribute was beautiful. The soundtrack was amazing. I highly recommend it|, Out of all the MCU movies this is the most emotional one I’ve ever seen 😭😭😭|, I have to say (and some people may not agree with me but) I loved this movie a lot. This movie showed the true emotions of the characters and even the casts in real life. It shows the change in shuris character( it still breaks my heart) and Nakia and shuri are now all each other has, and I like the fact they honored Chadwick in such a beautiful beautiful way. HOWEVER, my heart will always love the 1st movie better. It was just so so amazing and Chadwick poured his love and soul into his character. The 1st movie will always top it for me. However everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I’m open to hearing everyone’s opinions just really wanted to put this out there🫶🏾|, That silent landing at the end was such a beautiful choice.|, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever had to be rewatched since it came out exactly a year ago today. Once again and forever, Chadwick Boseman would be proud on how well they honored his memory as the Black Panther. WAKANDA FOREVER!!!|, The most beautiful trailer from a marvel classic movie i had watch😍❤️🔥.|, Wakanda Forever is a great sequel and they really nailed it despite knowing how low people's expectations were due to the passing of the late Chadwick. The characters and the story all flow naturally and nothing felt forced. There's a lot of strong women in this movie yet they don't shove any feminism agenda in your face. This is a movie with women empowerment done right. Also, you can feel the raw emotion of all the characters mourning the loss of the late Black Panther. This movie is one of the best in MCU phase 4.|, The final scene with Letitia is an incredibly beautiful and realized cinematic moment."

His acting is so underrated on Sunny.|, The first half of the trailer won me over, but the ProZD appearance completely sold me|, I can't wait to see this. No matter what anyone says we owe the rise of smartphones to Blackberry. Their Achilles heel was to focus too much on the business side that when the iPhone and Android came along they didn't see them as serious competition until it was too late. This looks like it it'll be so good.|, We are all going to love this movie.... because of the implication|, I miss my Blackberry every single day, lol. It was amazing. At the very least, the most elegant looking smartphone, and after owning every other brand, far and away the best performance for my needs. This looks like fun and it gives me the feels.|, The saddest part of this movie is we already know how it ends|, Fabulous movie! It is hilarious, suspenseful even though we all know what happened, and triumphant even if just for its chapter in tech history. There was a point in the movie where I literally cried, ecstatically!...for a tech film...and nobody died or saved an animal stuck in mud. Baruch...Baruchnel...Jay was an excellent  geek. They all were. Howerton was the perfect level of shark-like intensity. He didn't just yell like a poser. It was like he was going to explode, and spontaneously combust everyone within a 10 mile radius along with him. Clever funny way of expressing the little things. Incredibly paced and edited. The clip at 1:30 in the trailer was funnier in the movie. They should have done the ""you want to be great, you need to sacrifice"" and then cut to the quiet lag and Jay captioning that he's still standing there, seeing Doug in the window. That was so well done you could practically hear the crickets. 
The trailer is exceptionally well done. And the movie is right behind it. I probably didn't appreciate the Doug character enough. Sometimes when a thing works you don't notice it, because you don't notice that it didn't work. I think that was the Doug character. It fit, although if he was going to be the smart slacker with the tennis band there could have been more variety. When the years were being placarded, stock charts could have been shown. The network overload could also have shown more technical visuals. Although it successfully went retro, that doesn't mean overlays of tech stuff could not have appeared in the film.|, Howerton is so talented."

Simple yet effective way for Peter to teach Miles the responsibility of being Spider-Man. It’s a hard reality that Peter had to accept, you can’t save everyone, but as long as you make it a daily goal to at least save one, one person, daily. You already helped the city suffer less. You keep giving people the motivation and hope they need.|, When you feel scared, think of this scene, think of this song and face your fears|, 2:20 is one of the most beautiful cinematic scenes ever. Gave me and everyone in the movie theatre chills when we first saw it on the big screen|, I like how he not only earned being Spider-man, but also earned this song.|, An origin story can't be more badass than this.|, I’m sure most people know this already, but I love the script for when this scene plays.

You can take any shot from the film and frame it, it's a work of art.|, THE most underrated film in recent memory. Masterpiece.|, Watching this at the cinema in 2017 was absolutely the greatest cinematic experience of my life. Never have I been so absolutely captivated and awe-inspired by a film. It is nothing short of an unadulterated masterpiece.|, When I first saw it at release I thought it was a great movie, a worthy sequel. Since then I watched it many times and it just kept digging deeper into me every time. Almost every character and every scene has enormous depth to it even if it is sometimes told in the subtlest ways. I am now basically obsessed with it. The only thing I can't forgive is that they revealed who the child is instead of letting the viewers come to a conclusion by themselves."
Blair Witch,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,girSv9UH_V8,13124821,41476,9641,"It goes to show the difference in generations. What made the first Blair witch good, was how understated it was.  It didn't rely on loud noises and jump-scares to be scary.  It was done in such a way that it put the viewer in the experience, too.  The movie was emotional and scary because you could empathize with the characters, and suspend your disbelief to a point where you felt like you were there.  Nowadays, most horror movies rely on shaky-cam and predictable jump-scares, in lieu of a good story or suspenseful plot lines or emotional character arcs.  The first Blair witch was somewhat believable because it left the supernatural elements to your imagination, whereas (albeit all of my info is only from the trailer) this new one looks to be more ""in your face"" with it.  It's like they focus-grouped the first movie, and just took all the scary parts that tested well from the first one and just made a movie about those parts.  Obviously I haven't seen the movie yet, but as is the case with mostly all modern horror movies, it's probably overdone and not truly going to live up to the reviews and claims of it being ""One of the scariest movies ever made"". Attention spans have shortened these days. If you take a teenager and try to get them to watch the original ""Psycho"", or ""The Exorcist"", they would probably tell you that it's too slow and not scary.  To me, a scary movie comes from the plot, not the special effects.|, I have no idea why audiences over here have a negative review on this movie but it was really amazing & creepier than I had thought ! The connection with the 1st part & that creepy house at the climax was everything ! 👏😰|, I will stand by my opinion that the first Blair Witch movie was the KING of the mocumentary horror movies.  It was done really well and the way the director went about it was genius. 
Very underrated movie and not a movie for people with lack of imagination. I'm interested to see how this one does.  Hopefully, No stupid monster reveal at the end or some crappy jumpscare. 
Keep it close to home!|, Don’t you just love a movie when the camera won’t stop shaking & everyone’s screaming|, The thing I hate most about this is that whether you like or hate the original Blaire Witch Project film, you must admit that it was its very own thing. It was the first of its kind. It literally created a new genre of horror movies. I personally adored the film with its looming feeling of terror and the idea of more ""thinking of what's out there"" than actually seeing it. 

And then when they do this to it. Adding jumpscares, gross out horror, meaningless gore, and even a cliche little girl voice singing a popular song slowly to make it seem scary, it's literally taking an original concept and shooting it in the throat. So, no. No thanks Hollywood.|, The sad thing to me is that this movie is so badly reviewed because no one watches it more than once. The second time you watch it the scares don't get you and you can really start to understand why everything is happening. It's actually really well put together in my opinion. People are just too shallow to understand the little, and VERY BLATANT hints.|, I'm actually really excited to see this. My favorite horror movie was the first one and while I'm sad that this doesn't follow the found footage approach to the letter, it doesn't look bad. I just really hope that they DON""T SHOW THE WITCH! The devil you don't know is far scarier than the one you do. If you don't show her, she could be anything. It's better to let people imagine their fear rather than have it shown to them.|, I cannot wait to see this movie, honestly. The first one gave me chills. I'm interested to see what this one is like.|, If you're the kind of sophisticated horror movie fan who thinks story, acting and atmosphere takes a second place to loud noises and screaming then this is the movie for you. Almost every event has a massive sound. People walking onto camera in the night surprising others, people running through the woods, trees falling are at 200 decibels. Strange cameras those guys are using.|, I loved the original film, made all the better by the accompanying book The Blair Witch files.  In the book it says that the house where the murders of the children took place had been burned down after the killer was caught, yet the teens go into his house, also that they travel over an area that has hills etc, whilst the book explains the area they were travelling around should have been flat, so it shows they were in somewhere 'strange'  I also liked that you did not see the witch, the imagination is by far scarier than reality.  Hope this new film won't dissapoint."

The man's a genius.|, I know most adam sandler movies are hit or miss, but this one, in my opinion, is one of his best. XD|, As someone from South Africa, i love seeing a movie that doesn't just say we are starving 
Africa is totally different than media shows it to be 
Even though this movie is shot in South Africa i am really excited that it doesn't highlight our flaws|, This movie was so good! Such an easy, feel good watch! Had me laughing and crying. So many funny moments but some truly touching ones too- it's awesome! If you are on the fence, jump over and watch it!|, This movie was hilarious from beginning to end!  The theatre was packed and as we were walking out everyone was saying what an awesome movie it was.  Definitely a must see!  I went with a friend and I am going to go again so my husband can see it.|, I love this movie, such a great feel good movie. The chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler is amazing. Movies like this and the wedding singer are both good movies but 50 first dates will always be my favourite|, This movie was funnier than the trailer shows. My mom was wheezing of laughter at one point. This film was great. One of the best Adam Sandler movies I have ever seen. I would actually like a sequel to this.|, Actually I really kinda like this movie. It makes me feel somewhat happy no matter how many times they play it on HBO.  I hope movies like this will never go away. Have a great day everyone!:)|, The comedy was spot-on for me and the cinematography was superb. As an African, (Cameroonian studying in SA), I love how the movie showcased not just the flora and fauna of Africa, and didn't show Africans as poor, sickly people in need of Western aid, but as a beautiful, clean and developed place where people can spend a wholesome holiday. Terry Crews' South African accent was close enough too. Good job|, this movie was better than i thought"

Well done!|, lThis is a good movie. Antonio cried real tears. I felt his pain.|, Great movie!|, Ultima understood what is truly God.   She didn't let ""dogma "" confuse her knowledge: a true prophet.|, Antonio Marez is 6 years old when Ultima comes to stay with his family in New Mexico. She is , one who cures with  herbs and magic. Under her wise wing, Tony will test the bonds that tie him to his people. Deeply, we are experiencing these dilemma's, but we have a pathway to success in our statues, it does not call for rotten deeds, but a future to uphold. God will guide us, even if, you believe in herbs.|, Excellent movie.|, Must read for mesoamerican art history class, classic.
God is the wind the flowers and rocks....amen|, When does one charge to do God's work? Never|, Excellent movie."

No words.|, It was the summer of 76 in San Francisco and somehow I ended up in the front row gazing up at Linda and man could she sing. I hope she’s surrounded by love. She helped so many great musicians and she’s been such a wonderful person…..she deserves grace 👏👏👏👏|, Her voice ranges from a whisper to a belt and what control! One of a kind vocalist. Great song written by Roy Orbison and Joe Melton.|, She is incredible.  So talented.  Wish I could go back in time. 😢|, It still gives me chills to hear it even after all these years|, No one can sing 'Blue Bayou' like Linda. She's one of a kind!!|, One of the greatest voices of the past 50 years and one of the greatest performances in all of popular music.|, What an amazing talent.|, Out of all the top notch female vocalists, both past and present, I can't think of anyone who had/has the ability to inject emotion into her singing to the extent that Linda Ronstadt did, She's simply superb!"

And Cate Blanchett - she’s just… I don’t even have words. Perfection.|, This movie completely convinced that Cate Blanchett is one of the greatest actresses of this time.|, 10 years old!

Woody Allen delivers another success with Cate Blanchett giving one of the best performances of her career
This movie really becomes an emotional roller coaster with Jasmine starting conversations with those around her and eventually blowing up their lives 
Allen directs her not as likable but providing a fascinating character study
Blanchett is a pure gold here|, Cate Blanchett was phenomenal in this role!|, I try to ignore that this is a Woody Allen movie and just look at the performances. And Cate is beyond great. This is magnificent.|, Cate Blanchett was phenomenal in the movie , but I can also see Patricia Clarkson playing this role too|, Cate Blanchett - she just never sucks|, Cate Blanchett is just … well … there are words!|, I was very impressed with Bobby Cannavale as Ginger's boy friend, a marvelous performance.|, Cate just fantastisk 👍просто великолепна🌿"
Blue Jay,How to Worship like an Ancient Egyptian,4CwhX4IR_oM,719101,40089,1790,"Make sure to check out Total War: PHARAOH and use this link!
https://play.totalwar.com/BlueJay|, BlueJay’s further evolution to a cheerful psychopath is the character arc we all need.

Edit: changed the word sociopath to psychopath. Apparently I don’t know the difference between the two.|, For those wondering why sometimes the gods overlap on domains, it's because Ancient egypt had at least 4 different centers of religion, so for example Thoth was an important god in Memphis, Which had an entire pantheon that didn't include the likelyhood of Ra and his children in such an equal veneration, or if at all.|, Anubis is still objectively the coolest Egyptian god and I will not tolerate any replies saying otherwise.|, The more I learn about Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Norse mythology the more I realize Rick Riordan really toned down some of the stories.|, You didn't mention that Isis and Osiris were twins and fell in love in the womb.  Also that when Isis breathed life into Osiris to get it up and play 2 player smash, she wasn't able to totally bringhim back, but their child, Horus, was able to.(The one conceived from that particular fling.)  Horus then went to kill Set, but Isis stopped him, because that's her brother/brother-in-law, so Horus cut her head off instead, but then panicked, and tried to save her life.  Since ancient Egyptians KNEW the head contains nothing important, Horus just sewed the head of a cow onto her and it was all hunky dory.

Oh yeah, and Osiris is just a zombie.  Like, he was literally brought back from the dead with necromancy, and his green decayed flesh is... kinda his trademark.|, Poor Alex just can't catch a break. It's wild how many of these myths directly mention sperm and genitalia as major plot points. Egypt was freaking wild. Also, the way Anubis judges souls is by far the best and most metal afterlife myth ever.|, Making the bald man cry is hands down the best euphemism I’ve ever heard. My god you’re such a gem keep it up man, hoping for a Christmas live story like last year!|, I fucking love BlueJay’s character development that is consistently and progressively making Alex’s life a living hell, bc when BlueJay pulled out that knife, I lost all composure 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂|, The fact that you went out your way to draw all those arms folded just for a the sun gods hissy fit is one of my favorite things"

Really , really great film!|, This film is a small masterpiece, and I don't even like the genre much. The aesthetic and observational detail is exquisite and compensates for the grimness, which is at least original; the storytelling is taut, never lets go, never cops out. 10/10|, This was great . Green room, hold the dark , murder party . Jeremy’s movies all are amazing in their own way|, This movie is so beyond good I can't even explain how good it is.|, Such a wonderful movie. I really wish more people would watch this masterpiece.|, I really like how this trailer was made, how it absolutely spoils nothing and that it just doesn't show much at all unlike most trailers.

You can always depend on A24 to give us something truly unique!|, I really hope A24 gets recognized for giving us something more than franchises and existing IP’s.

You are going to LOVE this movie.|, Intense Scream vibes! Every generation should be so lucky to get a defining horror film.|, Another horror/slasher film with good reviews? We have to stan. There's no such thing as having too many good, if not decent, horror/slasher films.|, Maria Bakalova is super talented and Borat was a perfect breakthrough role for her.

Amazing!|, Everyone has been talking about Charlize Theron's transformation, which yes, is phenomenal. But I have got to talk about how impressed I am with Nicole's as well! Absolutely incredible. This is clearly going to be a great movie. It is obvious that these women completely disappeared in to their roles. Can't wait!|, I can't get over how perfect Charlize is in turning herself into Megyn Kelly. It shouldn't be a shock because we've seen her do it before but... holy crap, that's insane. This movie genuinely looks incredible, I'm honestly excited to see this cast going for it.|, I watched this movie today. When the story was over and the lights were on back again, I swear to God, I saw some old ladies smiling. A silent act of empowerment. That's why we need women acting, producing, directing films. To be silent when we need to be but also be very LOUD.|, Imagine someone casting Charlize Theron to play you in a movie...the highest honor|, Charlize HAS to win the Oscar. Incredible acting once again wow i didnt know if it was her or Megan in the trailer. Amazing|, This trio is explosive :) All credits are for Charlize. She combined all and make it happen.

Between this and Spielberg's The Fabelmans, Thanksgiving is gonna be a good time to go to the movies...|, Taylor Russell deserves more praise. Ever since Waves I've loved her. Such a great actress!!|, This movie was truly a masterpiece. It had a mix of thriller events, realistic teenager first love and a very chilling horror aspect to it. The kind of horror that plays with your minds. Also, The contrast between the fantasy and the reality in every scene was epic. Especially at the end, when the three of them were heavily breathing on the floor fighting for their lives, meanwhile it was completely silent outside. The way it showed chaos in a such a small room versus the dead silence outside was brilliantly done. What impressed me the most is, The camera shots and angles l, it had a realistic feeling to them, making you feel like you're not watching the movie but IN THE MOVIE. I have to say that I didn't like the very ending, it felt too extreme. I understand that it symbolizes someone loving someone to the bones and all, but I'd have preferred that they let them have their happy ending.|, I’m so in love with the way they changed the story making it have a deeper meaning but still staying true to the book in many ways it’s very beautiful to see I’m very excited|, I was so surprised by this film, I awaited  allegories and metaphors, but I did not expect them to be so deep and smooth.
It was an amazing piece of art, about  causing the pain to others and to yourself. And how it's sometimes impossible to control it.|, The movie plot took a left turn so quickly from the beginning and I love it. I was about to roll my eyes at another coming of age teen movie.|, This film looks like ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""Natural Born Killers"". It shines a light on outsiders in ways we can't imagine! Looks so provocative and Timothee is a tour de force in everything he does!! So excited to see this!! 👏❤|, This looks gruesome and intense and so well made. I think it would be fantastic as a double feature with Only Lovers Left Alive.|, This film is pure art! I was drawn to it via Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' music....then I read the book in 3 days...saw the film yesterday. It is a story that sticks with you. A brilliant piece of cinema in an age of throwaway ""movie"" spectacle.|, This feels like it's worth seeing. It might be morbid but everyone involved makes it work."

Born to Be Blue,Chet Baker - Born to Be Blue,3y11EHQAGhU,1646524,18324,353,"The first time I met Chet Baker, he was playing at a little neighborhood club called Strykers on 97th & Columbus Avenue on Manhattan's Upper West Side. He was coming back after years of an extended period of absence, having diligently devoted himself to re-learning to play trumpet with dentures, which everybody told him could not be done. But he persevered and prevailed, and this was one of his first comeback gigs. Awesome! I never heard any trumpet sound like that! I don't think it could ever be captured on a recording: So intimate tender innovative & personal...sometimes just whispering & breathing infinite silence space&timelessness into his trumpet...He just loved music & making music so deeeeeeeeeply & innately: just making the purest finest most beautiful sounds and blissful ethereal effects. Chet Baker was truly a great Maestro of the highest degree, a natural-born precocious musical genius like Mozart!

During the break I came up to Chet to thank & enthusiastically congratulate him. In my over-enthusiasm I started telling Chet how much I also dug & admired & had been imitating his singing for years, and automatically went into my little imitation of him singing “I Wish I Knew” till I caught myself & felt embarrassed & silly & said,“Oh no! Here I am doing my Chet Baker imitation for Chet Baker!” He just smiled & said “You don't look old enough to remember that record.” (1955 LP called “Chet Baker Sings& Plays"")

He looked gaunt & emaciated, almost like a derelict. But his voice and manner were very polite mellow kind & refined, sensitive gentle very personable sweet good-natured & very likable, casual cultured & very well-bred. I asked him if he would sing during his second-set after the break. He thanked me for asking but apologized & explained why he really couldn't because he was working with just a bassist & drummer & no piano...
He excused himself when his band-mates summoned him to prepare for their second set. There were just a few other people at that very small dimly-lit cellar club that night. My date was a nice girl who had the same last name as me though we were otherwise unrelated, I barely remember her, but we were both blown-away by Chet! 

When Chet came back from the break, he opened his set singing “Just Friends” Bless his heart! Still feels good that he honored my request & was singing just for me!  His singing always kinda reminds me of Alfalfa from “Our Gang” 
 
I still listen to Chet's music almost every day now, often listening to him continually all day long, and when I try listening to something else for a change, I find myself missing his familiar soothing sound which is so much an integral part of me, I find myself unable to listen to anything else & hafta sink right back into that sweet fine&mellow transcendent celestial atmosphere he creates so effortlessly & endlessly...   

PS: I had given Chet my business card that night, and to my surprise & amazement—first thing in the morning--he called me! But that's another story for another time now...|, i just never get bored of this song... the guitar keeps me mesmerized|, Love that soft piano intro. Sends chills down my spine.|, The piano and Chet's voice make this one of the most outstanding jazz pieces yet. This is the stuff to play on a rainy afternoon or late at night. Does anyone know what year he recorded this?|, This guy makes me feel like maybe someone could actually relate to my sadness. What a wonderful musician.|, Esta melodía, esta obra de arte me ha acompañado en momentos tan trascendentales de mi vida, que hoy sería una locura nombrarlos. Gracias a Chet Baker, por hacer esta maravilla.|, Many of the most haunting & evocotive pieces I have heard in jazz have come from Chet Baker, either in his vocal delivery, or in the structure of the song. This is a great example. Combining haunting piano combined with Chet Baker's vocals, & beautifully mixed. This is how it's done. Chet sings the song like he's lived every line & that makes a great singer! One of the best jazz pieces I've heard in a while. |, His voice and the piano give me chills|, I love that guitar comping.|, One of the most psychedelic music piece I’ve heard"

Both Sides of the Blade,Both Sides of the Blade - Official Trailer | HD | IFC Films,OBTJTtOiuzg,113087,510,21,"Love, longing, nostalgia, desire, dilirium, betrayal, deception, guilt, anxiety, madness...all the furor of passion, and handled with the deft maturity of French cinema, starring the brilliant, beautiful, effervescent Juliet Binoche. To the theater I go!|, I will blindly follow Clair and Julie in anything they make.|, Dear Mösyö Claire,author madame Christine and the whole casting crew,thank you so much for this wonderful film, well ı was thinking to myself about the main theme of this movie and also the novel of course,ı think love and mateships might not be an easy subject for noone especially in this 'modern' 21th century era, ı mean regarding all the social media,internet,tv shows,the mainstream media control and manipulations over the public,actractive mind washes,and the consumer capitalist society our practical daily lifestyles that are motivated by office conditions,fastfood and so many busy hours at work for so many people, marriage or any love relationship is not an easy thing tot maintane anymore, big city life is not in accoardance with monogamic relationships ı am afraid. Romantism is dying,profund love relationships in depth are dying as far as ı can see as well dear sir,people do not pay attention and care about each other no more,nobody cares about other people, how sad and that is exactly why ı like smaller places,villages,towns,etc in particular, because relationships are still  warmer and more intimate and kind in such places, people still care about their neighbours,and people still have smiling faces at villages,people such as like my mom or grandmom, the old people were way tolarable and patient in comparison to today's young generations, my  mom never had left my father despite of his so many serious mistakes but now as far ası can see people leave each other so easy because there are tons of dating websites and various apps and so the young generation think that they can find some others and get into new relationships  easly so why shoud they bother. but it does not seem right to me, not at all. I know that my big butt obsession seems a bit rude and weirdo, it deserves to be mockable of course, but if this is my true nature then what can ı do anyways? I hope there are still ladies out there who care about their partners and hesitate a bit before they abonden them so easy just as had been portraited by dear beautiful actress lady Juliette in this very  movie she was not faithfull but she was emotional for the least,she had some difficultuies and bad times before living him for another guy so she was a good lady even though she made some mistakes. Much respect and love.|, Thanks. 
I could see this film at BAFICI  last April.
I enjoyed very much. An excellent  film.|, The trailer is better than the movie; intermittent romances dancing aimlessly: expection high; result ....low|, Juliette Binoche could still 100%|, I wish I knew French so I could watch French movies in the original language.|, Excellent psycho sexual thriller|, Claire Denis will save us|, I'VE BEEN WAITING."

Like she knew in that moment her entire world was gonna about to change.|, I was married to a gay man who wanted nothing more than to be straight. The extent our church went to in order to ""pray the gay away"" was disgusting. Nothing ""Godly"" about the bullshit they spewed. He is still my absolute soul mate and nothing makes me happier than when he and his partner bring their two adopted children over for family dinners. The church set him and myself up for so much pain. It hurt like hell when I knew I had to let him be who is was/is but after some time to heal I wouldn't trade our new dynamic for the world.|, I’m not gay or Christian, but this is truly heartbreaking on every level, I feel for these people.|, I am a straight woman. I do not understand homophobia. How can this be a problem to anyone is beyond my comprehension! 2 adults love each other, want to be together, don’t wanna hurt anyone ——> where is the problem in accepting this situation?|, As a Christian I am emotional just watching the trailer! It breaks my heart there are people using Gods name to spread hate and discrimination. God CAN and DOES love you the way you are. Anyone telling you something different is mistaken.|, Thanks everybody for supporting the movie. It was an honor to have a role in this movie - I played ""Phillip"" - I was one of the conversion camp attendees.  If you have any questions about the production of the movie - ask a question in the comments and I'll answer what I can. Thanks again!|, When my daughter came out to me, I already knew. I had always known. But I cried for days. Only because I KNEW that people she loved...family...would disappoint her by not accepting who she was.  I will protect her with everything I have, though. She deserves a beautiful life and I swear to God, she WILL have it.|, As a believer and a out gay man (I'm currently 25 years old) I first saw this when I was 23 years old. A friend at my church actually told me to watch this. It brought me to tears. I'm very lucky that although I lost my church I went to when I came out, a lot of friends. I didn't lose my faith. I was lucky to have found a place to call my home spiritually. But I believe all Christians need to see this movie. It's so moving.|, I want to live in a world where everyone gets accepted for who they are. no matter their skin, their origin, their sexuality, their interests etc.

let people live. let them be happy. being happy is the most important thing in life|, The part when he says “because you’re making me angry” really gets me and I don’t know why"
Boyhood,Boyhood | Official US Trailer | IFC Films,Y0oX0xiwOv8,5302170,25763,2068,"This movie was pretty cool, you are literally watching this kid grow up. The movie felt a little long, but it wasn't at a point where it was being dragged out. I was enjoying it the whole time. By the end of the movie I was thinking about the beginning parts, and it was crazy to think it was the same movie because it felt completely different. This movie really makes you feel each moment of this kid's life.|, Im sitting here age 21 living in my dads basement literally healed from a depression. This movie is a breath of fresh air and hit me at the perfect time in my life where I really needed to be inspired. Im reading a lot of negitive comments on here about the film witch at first shocked me as this is probably the greatest film I have ever viewed. I don't know if ""true feelings"" have died in our generation or maybe this movie was just too accurate to my life. that being said its movies like this that in my eyes change us. we connect with. Remind us to feel the moment.  |, I love how this movie is so real. So many movies these days glamorize or exaggerate life in general, but Boyhood is simple and relatable and raw and emotional. Also, the acting in this was amazing!|, I cannot believe people don't enjoy this film, they've missed the point entirely saying there's no plot or that's it's boring. This films about a boy going through the many phases of growing up, it's about life. I guess you just have to relate to it to really love it. I'm the same age as the actor so seeing him grow up in the same time that I did really affected me. It touches on so many themes of growing up and how we just move on from milestone to milestone until it's over. I'm probably not making much sense to a lot of you but it's hard to explain why I love this movie so much, but I just wanted to throw my two cents out there because it moved me a lot haha|, 12 years boiled down to 2 hours. I wonder how they all felt at the end. |, As a 20 year old male I found this film to be absolutely one of a kind. The filming lines up with similar times to my childhood, and seeing all the contemporary references, trends, and relatable situations was like watching my life flash before my eyes over the course of 3 hours. If you're looking for some exciting movie leaving you on the edge of your seat with plot twists or over-dramatization, steer clear. It's a simple yet heartwarming journey that is told with very subtle emotion and beautiful imagery.|, I remember watching this for the first time 8 years ago. I remember never taking my eyes off the TV and I remember being upset it had to end. One of the most heartfelt films ever created!|, Boyhood is undoubtedly one of the most haunting films ever made. I cried so MUCH. Mason's story reminded me in some parts of mine. It was an out of body experience to watch it. It was disheartening, gutwrenching and beautiful to watch this kid grow up. It made me realize how time flew and flies so rapidly, how fragile and fleeting life can be, how in the blink of an eye you were an innocuous kid, then a rambunctious teen and turning without warning as a full blown adult. And in between, you face predicaments, deaths in the family and in your friends' group, drama, confusion, angst, first times, first kisses, meet your best friends who might stick till the end or not, lose your virginity or not, succeed at school or fail expeditiously, you live to the fullest until settling down, move-ins and move-outs, witness your parents fighting, have your first dog, spend countless sleepovers talking about girls or boys even both, gossip about anyone at school and playing videogames, go to camp spending summers of a lifetime with kids you'll never see again or not, you crush on other people, you get your heart broken, you fight with your parents and siblings, you're looking for who you want to be, you suffer but you laugh but most importantly, you learn how to LIVE. And still, the older you get, you never cease learning and growing. Watching Boyhood left me reeling and crying for a whole night. But I felt pride and closure. My past has been a tainted, wild journey but turning into a 28 year old graduate from grad school with a Master's degree, living in Paris and able to withstand depression, two suicide attempts, being a gifted child with ADHD, bullying and being bullied, my mom's car crash, losing some friends to untimely deaths or by going to jail for drug selling or murder and overcoming alcohol abuse. Boyhood is not only a movie but a statement of life's beauty of life's fast but invisible pace, of time's unfathomable but irresistible grip on our fate. It's an embodiment of what time is, how every single decision and mistake contained in one life can shape and affect you but not necessarily determine who you'll become. It's a wheel in constant motion which takes us, rolls us along, makes us grow from young to old then eventually kill us.|, I never watched a movie this long and thought ""I wish it was longer""

it's just gorgeous|, This was honestly one of the best films I have ever saw in my life. I felt like I grew up with Mason, and even though the movie was very long, I just didn't want it to end. I will never forget this movie."

One old college friend cofounded a mobile game company that's now worth hundreds of million...|, I like Stiller in roles like these. I'm looking forward to all the wisdom about dealing with one's life not going as originally imagined.
This trailer also reminds me of the old adage comparison is the thief of joy.|, This actually seems pretty good. A lot more philosophical then I thought it would be. I just hope it doesn't end with him realising that his life's achievement is that he's a great farther.|, I just couldn't hold back the tears eventually. Contentment is indeed a virtue. May we all learn to appreciate what we have and be genuinely thankful.|, This movie relates to my life right now.I failed my family ,myself and I just tell myself that I'm alive and okay.|, My father once said that his greatest achievement was never being rich or has a powerful job, but his was knowing and seeing all his children become good people, to be kind and tolerant toward others.|, To me, the director of this movie gets the tone just right.  Ben and his movie have done an excellent job in their roles too.  A gem of a movie!|, I like that Ben is doing more serious movies now. The last one he did was the Secret Life Of Walter Mitty which was an incredible film. And I hope that this one is to.|, I'm 22 and empathise with Brad's midlife crisis. Lol|, Every movie Ben Stiller plays in turns into a phenomenon 👏👏"
Brahms: The Boy II,Brahms: The Boy II Trailer #1 (2020) | Movieclips Trailers,ytxEldPKnyA,4447748,42164,2975,"I mean I love The Boy, but I don't know why there's a sequel.|, That last scare was the least scary thing in the whole trailer|, If you're confused, the writer explained in an interview that brahms was odd as a child because he was under the influence of the doll. This sequel had a lot scenes that are very similar to Brahms' backstory in movie 1(how he was becoming a psycho, hurting a kid, etc) because they want to indicate in the same sense that Brahms wasn't crazy from the get go, contrary to 'pub talk'. That only after discovering the doll, both boys turned psycho. The end of the second movie showing the boy wearing a porcelain mask, talking to the doll about his parents and the rules, was kind of a hint on how he was gonna be the next brahms.|, The whole reason why I liked the first one was because the plot twist of it wasn't the ordinary supernatural scare.|, ""Take him to a place he feels safe."" And they take him to an old mansion in the middle of the woods.
Yeah, that's great parenting right there... Anyone remembered to just give him a cookie?|, A film that did NOT need a sequel.  No one left the theater saying ""give me more of that.""|, This looks like a sequel but feels like a prequel|, Wasn’t the whole point of the original movie that he was a murderous sociopath living in the walls of the house and the doll was just representation of the kid? It wasn’t a haunted doll it was just a dude.|, A family moves to an abandoned house, possessed doll, jump scares. 
Never seen anything like this before!! very original !!|, Brahms killed that little girl in the forest when they were younger, parents staged house fire to make it looks like Brahms was dead so they could protect their little boy (as any parent would) and keep him alive living in the walls. The doll was never possessed. Brahms was never possessed. Nothing was supernatural. It was made to look like that at the beginning, until Brahms crashed through the wall near the end and you find out it was never a ghost all along. At the end of the first film, Brahms pieced the doll back together. Brahms did not die. The end."
Breaking In,Breaking In - Official Trailer [HD],DsDVOt3M7OM,7466793,22216,1517,"They picked the perfect girl to play her daughter, she really looks like shes related|, I love how the son steps up at the end, you know there is character growth there: from annoying little brother to man of the family|, People might wonder and complain on how she is capable of doing all of this extra stealth shit and I won't blame them. But one thing is for certain, when it comes to protecting your family, you'll do some amazing feats that you probably have never done before so kudos to that|, This is actually the first movie in awhile I’m excited to see! Ive always loved Gabrielle Union and how she legit does not age. Shes such a great actress like it baffles me how she’s so underrated, I want her in more movies!|, Just saw it..Spine tingling non-stop suspense. Don't mess with a mother like her. I read her new book too..she is open about the horrible rape she endured while working at a Payless shoe store. She probably took martial arts after that experience. She's a strong together sistah that has overcome a horrific experience. I commend her honesty and attempt to help others through it.|, This looks exciting. A mother's determination to protect her children is not something to be messed with.|, i kept on repeating this trailer again and again and i freaking love it|, This is a great way to represent Mothers day. All -mothers- women are strong! A black thriller? Yes! Love it. x|, A strong, independent,proud BLACK MOTHER! cant wait to get into the theater! I love the first scene where the guy points out the fact that she is a women as if its a bad thing and Gabrielle Union takes em two steps back and shows them there is nothing wrong with traditionally feminine roles.And to see a minority as the star with her chocolate kids is so refreshing! Everything about this is just good vibes all around.YAY I'm so excieted for this movie!|, A black thriller that doesn't involve a love triangle with a psychotic former lover? SOLD!!!!"

Leave me breathless
Come on
Hey, yeah

The daylight's fading slowly
But time with you is standing still
I'm waiting for you only
The slightest touch and I feel weak

I can not lie
From you, I can not hide
And I'm losing the will to try
Can't hide it (can't hide it)
Can't fight it (can't fight it)

Until I can't deny this

Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah, come on
Yeah

And if there's no tomorrow
And all we have is here and now
I'm happy just to have you
You're all the love I need somehow

It's like a dream
Although I'm not asleep
And I never want to wake up
Don't lose it (don't lose it)
Don't leave it (don't leave it)

So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on

Of all the songs on that DVD that I heard several times a day, every day, for months it's the only one I can still listen to. A testament to how good this song is.|, Always loved this song!  Saw them in concert before they sort-of-broke-up to have families. They were wonderful in concert and the Irish songs were delightful to hear and got the audience going. Jim, Sharon, Caroline and Andrea are just awesome!|, 11 year old me back then will never think that 24 years later he will tear up over this song.  The nostalgia~|, This song is still one of the best songs ever released, and it always reminds me of the 90's, like a long roadtrip you never want to forget! :)|, One of their greatest hits!❤|, Mesmerized by this song, its a masterpiece. And how on earth does Andrea sing like she does...in the chorus its like happiness and melancoly at the same time. Does anyone else feel it? Especially the last notes in every phrase: Go on...Go ON, and when she sings ""Tease me"".  Its art! Not to mention the harmonies! What an arrangement! Perfection!|, my favorite song from them until today"

Cant wait to see it.|, This trailer alone sent chills down my spine. Brain's story is heart-breaking & I'm glad that it's being told!|, Brian Banks story is tragic. He could have played in the NFL and lived out his dreams. This woman ruined his life. The sad part is she didn't go to jail for lying. Where's the justice in that?|, I'm glad series and movies are being made about real people who served prison time for crimes they did not commit.  Keep them coming so their accusers can be exposed. I might check this movie out.|, I find this story of Brian Banks so inspiring and incredible. And There are many many people who ruin other people’s lives and for the justice system to not lock up the person who did this is disgusting and absolutely horrible. And this why people say not to believe every woman and that makes sense but not every woman are bad like certain people but this is life and it’s hard to go through like Banks did what he did to win his way back from prison is EXTRAORDINARY!|, I've just watched the film and I 100% recommend everybody to watch it it's absolutely amazing and shows how many times the justice system has screwed so many innocent people|, So happy this film's getting made. Been telling people about the dangers of false accusations for YEARS using this story as the prime example. Hopefully, this'll make more people realize.|, This is the movie our country needs right now. So happy your story can be told on the big screen. No matter how much privilege women say we have over them, they ultimately can ruin a mans entire life & reputation with jus accusations alone. So many stories like Brian's that never get told so I'm super glad that at least his can get told. #DontBelieveWomen #DontBelieveMen #BelieveEvidence|, People who say ""Believe all women"" need to see this movie. Honestly can't believe Hollywood let this movie come out!"

I think the world has forgotten what a truly terrifying point in history that was for the world|, Steven Spielber directing, Tom Hanks leading the movie and the Coen Brothers wrote the script. They might as well give it the Oscar already.|, Amazing story. Amazing acting. Amazing film altogether. Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks really outdid themselves with this one!!|, If there is Tom Hanks in the movie. You know it's gona be good|, This is one of my most anticipated films of the year.  The amount of talent going into this is amazing.  Spielberg is my favorite director of all time, and I got a chill when I saw the familiar, classic cinematography of Janusz Kaminski.  This is how I love to see films made.  Sadly, no John Williams, but Spielberg will make sure that Thomas Newman (also one of the greats) makes something unique and powerful.|, Spielberg is like my childhood hero. Seeing him come back with something like this gave me chills.|, Best movie I've seen all year. Script, acting, visuals, everything was just great|, Ever since the first trailer came out, I had been wanting to see the film. I saw it on Saturday 24 October, 2 days after it was released here. Definitely worth the wait. Great movie ...
and I swear, Tom Hanks isn't going to get old anytime soon, is he. He has been doing great films for decades now. My favourite actor, definitely."

Can't wait to watch this!|, So this answers the question: 'What if Clark Kent just lost it during puberty?'|, In a world like this, we need heroes like Lex Luthor to defend humanity.|, Full of gore, crazy deaths, and jump scares! Brightburn is absolutely brilliant. And that ending... a must watch for horror fans!|, This movie and The boys made us realize how grateful one should be for superman.

People should overcome the physical discomfort happening in the initial phase to enjoy its long-term benefits.|, It’s such a good movie that any runner is gonna relate to it.

He's the one that insists they take a family picture (in the background you can see him cutting each copy with scissors to give to the adults), he's the one that claims the baby as his brother,  he's the one who tells the mother thank you for being born... but the poor kid is in the background and told repeatedly he won't be adopted, but it doesn't stop him from trying to reunite. He made the movie for me.|, The concept is really good, and the vibes from the trailer itself is a lot soothing and peaceful than you would expect.

Great storytellers.

Such a great actor! And this movie looks amazing!|, I got to see the tiff premier of this fantastic film and Song Kang Ho and Kore Eda were present for speeches and question time. 
Kore Eda was asked if he planned on making more films abroad and he said something along the lines of, ‘I went out of my way to make a movie with a foreign cast in a foreign country just to work with Song Kang ho.’ Of all the ‘slimy guy with a heart’ roles Song Kang ho has had this ones the most Song Kang ho. 
If you’re considering seeing this trust me when I say it’s an absolutely marvel, perhaps moreso then Shoplifters, and brought the majority of the theatre to tears."

Funny ❌
Informantive ❌
Enjoyable ❌
Amazing ❌
Exists ✅|, When Billy Eichner said ""it's Eichner time!"" and he Eichner'd all over the place was truly one of the greatest moments in film history.|, It’s great that being gay is your entire personality.|, I somewhat enjoyed this movie. What got in my way of enjoying it fully was Billy Eichner's character. Luke Macfarlane did a FANTASTIC job. He's so goddamn handsome AND played the character really well. When he was asking Bobby for a second chance and started crying, I did too. And that is why I just can't shake this feeling that if it weren't for Billy Eichner's annoying character (as well as for Billy himself, for saying/joking that it would be homophobic not to go to the theatre to see this movie and so on), this movie would absolutely be a success. People absolutely need gay romantic films with comedy in it. There absolutely IS a demand for gay romance in movies in general. There absolutely IS a demand for that. Straight people don't need to be appealed to in order to get them to go see a gay movie. They will see the movie if it's good. It's easy as that. I mean, for god's sake, gays are the best at comedy but this movie didn't show that, whatsoever. That is also thanks to the too much shoving of LGBT topics in this movie. I am gay and I don't want to hear all this crap about LGBT issues anymore. If I go see a gay rom-com, I expect to see a fucking gay rom-com. Everything has its place. A gay movie is already caring a big message on its own and you don't need to shove any more LGBT issues in it, cause it automatically overshadows the film and this is basically one of the cons of this movie. If you just put two good-looking (Billy is not good-looking for a film, sorry) men and have a decent enough storyline, it will not bomb at the box office. We saw that with Brokeback Mountain. Both Heath and Jake did a fantastic job. I know many straight dudes who watched that movie and saw the raw emotion of the movie. I know many straight guys who admitted that they resonated with a character. I mean can you believe that? Yes, you can. Because if a movie is good and the actors play well, the sexual orientation part won't matter to most people. So, straight people WOULD absolutely show up for a gay movie if the movie was decent enough. So, whoever will do the next gay movie (probably in the next 5 or 10 years) with such a big budget, you should take notes and not repeat the same mistakes this movie did."

I’ve deployed a few times and I’ve heard horror stories about what people do when their spouses are deployed. It’s wicked.|, He not only did something really terrible just to get back to his family alive, but he can't tell them about it. Yet when he got back, they already moved on and forgot about him. That's peak frustration and pent-up anger right there.

I loved this movie.|, Absolute blast of a film. Charisma and energy through the roof! Incredible cast and fun scenes to keep you engaged all the way through.|, I loved it. It would be hard to make a sequel without y’know it being set in a train again but I think they should make another one and call it. “Bullet Train De-Railed.” With it being set in a train for a bit. I loved how every small detail tied together. Really go watch it, you might find something new every time you watch it because I did."

Bravo!|, This is an hidden gem of a movie. It covers the soulless aspect of relationships and plays the envy/jealous emotions of both characters very well. Angelina is a underrated storyteller.|, This film has proceeded to release a different perspective on those who are not able to have children in this life. It shows the anger and the miserableness of ones mind and how far someone can go to hold onto that dread and sadness. But also, to show us that it is up to us to change our perspective on life.

I know we get down from life and we have our horrible obstacles but once we understand that our actions are a mindset, change it.|, No I think many people didn't get what this movie was about especially the critics.  I love this movie for the simple reason that it's about a place in a person's life and they are simply conveying that experience I love the simplicity of that not to get confused with complexity of situation. I love this. I don't judge it I am invited inti the proccess of these individuals experience or in the proccess of that experience.  Angelina brad thank you. I came away from watching this to honor my experience whatever that looks like and it's okay it is mine instead of living up to what I think someone is going to think about where or whatever I am doing just go through the proccess be present in it without judgement of self or it|, Coming from a film critic, I’ll be honest, it was boring in the beginning but then it began to get interesting and the acting was phenomenal.|, ""We could be happy.
You resist happiness.""


These got to me. I'm her in real life.
This movie spoke to me.|, Ah...to Escape to such a place! This movie is the stuff of Dreams -the malaise and sorrow mere backdrops when compared to the multitude of where they are ~ Very Artistic and ridiculously well-done Love Story--A Best of All Time-- deserved a heck of a lot more praise and attention. I find myself returning to this far away Seaside village and re-making the story-no peep holes-no heartbreak; instead, just pure and perfect bliss. It would be so perfect to move there and live out one's days taking long walks, various boat rides and local excursions and basically really living the life. Angelina Jolie has triumphed in making a Golden film of a lost time and precious though previous Love ~ In my Heart, I think of these two Fine Actors as True Classics that can never be tarnished 💕🌷🌸 With Great Love ~ Stay Safe & Take Care!|, Beautiful movie... funny how people with their 2 cents opinions keep saying it's bad, this movie is real and you can learn a thing or two with the right perspective of it.

#MyOpinion|, Looks real good. Angelina Jolie is a great director as well as actress.|, I'd re-watch this just for the (1) soundtrack, (2) scenery, (3) interiors and (4) beautiful Citroën DS."

It made me dream, imagine, and get in touch with my creative mind. The soundtrack is brilliant. Give it a go :)|, Jesse such a good actor. He can be jesse, or jesse, or even play jesse. You wont even believe he is playing jesse|, Jesse Eisenberg is a good actor. I loved Adventureland.
Kristin Stewart is also talented. And Woody Allen as a director--wow.
I definitely will see this movie!|, Kristen and Jesse have a very similar acting style. They both play themselves in every movie.|, I watched almost all Woody's films. Love him and cannot wait to see this one! Should be hilarious!|, It's shot beautifully. Definitely represents the Golden Era or what we can imagine it might have been like. Haven't seen a movie shot like this. The dialogue is undoubtedly Woody with Jesse playing his best impression of a young Allen.|, Jesse Eisenberg is such a good actor, Love his work|, I love kris & jesse movies..their chemistry is just awesome. I hope thay do more movies together😀😍😙😙😙😙|, I love this movie. I especially like the brother in law that is a communist. He has some really funny lines. The character of his wife is brilliant- as is the joke about pregnancy. I think Woody really hit it out of the park. I would put it right up there with Midnight in Paris, Hannah and her Sisters, and Take the Money and Run.|, I literally can't wait to see this movie :)"

Had no medicines, yet they called him Healer. He had no army, yet kings feared Him. He won no military battles, yet He conquered the world. He committed no crime, yet they crucified Him. He was buried in a tomb, yet He lives today🙏🏻. His name is Jesus.❤|, My husband and I accepted the lord as our saviour and was both baptised three weeks ago|, God never sends you into a situation alone, God goes before you, He stands beside you, He walks behind you. Whatever situation you have right now be confident. God is with you. AMEN ❤|, Coming from depression and suicide to experiencing Christ's love is wonderful!!! I was saved last year on June, 2016. Before I was saved, I got bullied and excluded because I had autism and poor social skills. I also wore hearing aids. I am now fully healed of my hearing in Jesus' Name!!! I thought that my Nanny was the only person who loved and understood me. After she died on March 19, 2011, I became very depressed and angry with everyone and everything. I thought that the whole universe was against me so I shut myself out from the world and I stayed alone in my room a lot. I cried myself to sleep a lot. I kept asking God to help me but it didn't seem like He was there. Eventually I cried out to God, saying,""God, if you are real, why do you let bad things happen to me?! Why would you take my Nanny away?! Why aren't you answering my prayers?! Why aren't you helping me?! If you are real and you love me, then prove it to me!!"" It still didn't seem like He was even trying to help me so I became an atheist. I began to believe in the big bang theory. My depression, anxiety and anger got worse and the police was called a couple times. I was very rebellious towards my family! I began to struggle with suicide and I tried to kill myself. I thought that nobody loved or understood me. I thought that my life was getting worse and I thought that I would never be happy again! God did prove to me that He was real! I met a woman named Marilyn outside the library who showed me the truth of the Gospel. She explained to me that all bad things come from Satan and that Satan is a LIAR!!! She told me that Jesus died for my sins and that His love for me is so strong, that no matter what I have done, He loves me!!! I said the prayer of salvation that moment and ever since I gave my heart to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I have changed in a positive way! My anger is going away and my depression is going away. I am very happy now and the suicidal thoughts are fully gone!!! I now realize that my Nanny was not the only person who loved and understood me! I now know that there is another person who loves and understands me! This person is my beautiful Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ delivered me from suicide, depression, homosexuality, Atheism, and Transgender feelings. Thank God I didn't change my sex to look like a woman! I am now happy that God created me to be a man! Jesus Christ loves me so much and I am going to spend eternity with Him in the Kingdom of Heaven!!! Jesus Christ loves you all so, so much!!! You have no idea how much He loves us!!! No matter what you are going through or what you have done, He loves you and you are not alone! Do not listen to the lies of the enemy!!! Satan is a LIAR!!! Jesus LOVES you and He FORGIVES you!!! God bless you all!!!|, My husband asked to see our kids for the last time  cos he knew he was dying but Jesus wrapped his love around us. He is now healed. How can I forget what Jesus has done!!!!!|, Amen!... No one but Jesus could make us pure as snow!|, The Saviour alone carried the cross
For all of my debts, He paid the cost
Salvation complete, now forever I'm free
Calvary covers it all
Calvary covers it all
My sin and shame, don't count anymore
All praise to the One, who has ransomed my soul
Calvary covers it all
No power on Earth, not even the grave

Can You Ever Forgive Me?,CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? | Official Trailer [HD] | FOX Searchlight,UvJIaNsf_bY,5149517,9794,490,"Melissa McCarthy is an actress full of emotions, she's destined for more than just comedies|, So refreshing to see Melissa McCarthy in a more dramatic role like this. This looks fascinating.|, I love it when comedians play dramatic roles. I'm up for this one. Looks better than her habitual comedies.|, Just saw this the other day at a private screening and it's totally worth the watch.  On top of the seamless acting, writing, and choice of actors,  all cinematic choices are beautifully married together.  Felt quite congruous and didn't lack any elements. Considering the film is based on a true story,  it really enhances the relatability to Melissa McCarthy's character as Lee Israel whilst making you wonder how the hell the absurdity of it all can even be real.  It highlights the lengths Lee goes through to survive making ends meet in New York City in the early 90's-almost a bit hard to swallow. As far as the sensory realm goes, you feel every feel, smell every smell, and take every tumultuous turn.  It is unforviging, raw human emotion at it's very best.  A simultaneously enticing and cringe worthy performance.|, Yes! This is what McCarthy needs to do more of, not allowing herself to be horribly typecast by studios. Looks very interesting.|, Melissa is now nominated for BEST ACTRESS for her role here in this film.She is an excellent actress not just for comedies but any genre.You deserve it.🤘|, I hope she gets an Oscar for this. She is one of the best actresses we have right now.|, Melissa McCarthy is such a good actress, I'm rooting for her to be nominated at the academy awards|, This movie looks glorious! I hope it turns out as such. MM is a great actor. Putting her outside of some silly, slapstick comedy into something more dramatic just might be exactly what she needs to take her career to the next level. I hope so. She's so great and real and funny and smart and amazing in real life. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I've never not loved her work. And her costar? Perhaps it will do the same for him here in the States. He's been a British legend for decades. I cannot wait for the film.|, Such an underrated film. Not only the performances, but the whole film, writing, directing and OST was amazing"
Candyman,Christina Aguilera - Candyman (Official Video),-ScjucUV8v0,271550298,1225171,30261,"Only Christina Aguilera can pull off LITERALLY any look of any era. Shes just that beautiful 👁👄👁|, She done so well in this song, the harmonizing in her vocals, the dancing and the whole attire. this is everything|, This taught me that she can pull off absolutely any hair colour and look stunning.|, Christina is a legend she can sing everything. Bubblegum pop, r&b pop, jazzy pop, rock pop. She’s truly a versatile artist who’s done what she wanted & when she has a specific vision or theme she really nails it.|, Still one of the greatest looking videos of all time. Hats off to everyone involved with production and choreography.|, This was always one of my favourites. For such a tiny gal she can really belt it out . Her vocals are amazing !|, This song never gets old. No matter how much I listen, I never get bored.|, I love the WWII 40's vibe. As always, Christina looks great.|, What a total banger. Her pipes are unparalleled. This whole album is nothing but fire!!|, Nobody's gonna talk about  the fact that not only did her vocals sound perfect and her makeup ,hair and outfits looked incredible , but her body looked fantastic during this era!!"
Captain America: Civil War,CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (2016) Full Airport Battle Scene [HD] Marvel Clip,GV9AEEIeHrQ,23164804,127367,2487,"What I love about this fight scene is that despite everyone else taking the Fight Seriously, ANT-MAN and SPIDER-MAN are having the time of their lives lol really enjoying themselves 🤣🤣|, that face Bucky made when Peter stopped his full power punch while casually talking about his arm is still priceless to this day|, Rhodey falling was one of the most suspenseful moments in the whole MCU, the whole theater started shaking, and the music cut off and that *pow* and everyone stopped. Everyone. So powerful.|, Now imagine how much destruction this battle would've gotten if Thor and hulk was here 😄|, I’d say Civil War is the top Marvel movie. It introduces two major characters into the mcu while further advancing the storyline of the Avengers while keeping it a Captain America movie/story. Big props to the Russo Brothers for directing a movie with so many parts and stories👏🏽👏🏽|, I love the way Steve and Natasha's friendship is handled in this film, its like it was being tested, seeing if they would still be solid despite them having different viewpoints on the accords and being on opposing sides, they just respect each other too much. Not only that but listen to how Natasha speaks to Steve throughout the film like when they were deciding about the accords, the church scene and even at the airport she was being calm with him and trying to be gentle with him, not forcing anything down his throat and shouting at him like Tony was. Plus during the airport battle they never went near each other while fighting each other's groups, you just know they don't wanna hurt each other. You also see Steve's facial expressions towards Natasha from different points in the film like when she says "" Maybe Tony's right "" you can see the hurt and betrayal on his face when she reveals her decision, but he doesn't hold a grudge on her for doing so, he RESPECTS her choice. Then there is the scene where Nat switches sides and helps him by stopping Panther from reaching them, when she lifts her Widow's bite you witness the slight look on his face, like he believed she was about to fire at him, but when he sees what she had done he has a happy look on his face, glad that she helped him. 

I loved their bond in the MCU 💕💕|, You can tell Nat and Clint's friendship are extremely solid here, because they're the only ones who are like pretending to fight here|, ""You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude!"" 

The shocked / confused look on Bucky's face always makes me laugh 🤣🤣🤣|, I love these clips that they show the entire thing and doesn't stop in between. It's like the full fight scene without any cuts|, I love Spidey taking on Sam and Bucky is still one of my favorite fight scenes. Sam saying everyone has a gimmick is always hilarious 😂"
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,Captain America vs The Winter Soldier - Highway Fight Scene - Captain America: The Winter Soldier,bp6hhq8DdgU,11819861,157268,6849,"Check out Captain America’s best moments in the MCU: https://youtu.be/yXbjCMtkeqo|, No jokes and no cheesy one-liners to break the suspense... I wish more MCU fights were like this|, I'm just here to remind everyone that the knife flip on 0:50 is 100% authentic, and the actor, Sebastian Stan did all this by himself without visual effects and stunt doubles.|, No wizards. No gods. No aliens. No multiverse. Just great story with intense action scenes, great choreography, amazing characters without cheesy lines and ""wannabe funny"" scenes.

Still the best MCU movie.
Fury's chase scene, the elevator scene, this scene, Steve and Bucky's final fight... The tone of this movie is just different. It's not a comedy, but a thriller-like masterpiece.|, Still the top 3 action scenes from MCU. 
No elaborate CGI and bullshit. Just excellent fight choreography.|, 1:41 No matter how many times I watch it, this scene still gives me chills, I mean imagine that the guy that just tried to kill you was actually your best friend that you thought was dead!|, The fact that Natasha, the Black Widow,  the world's greatest spy and former assassin, was terrified of the Winter Soldier is enough to tell how much of a threat he is.|, The Winter Soldier's presence is just perfect. He's not a big evil mastermind, or alien titan, he's just a guy, seemingly like everyone else. His abilities don't come from a massive army or crazy superpowers, but great skill, a large arsenal of weapons and a touch of superhuman strength. He doesn't put on a big show, reveal his face or even talk, he gets straight to action. The mere sight of him is enough to let you know you're fucked.|, That punch from Bucky after he let the knife drop to his other hand is underrated, he was able to out strategize Cap for a few seconds which is nearly impossible to do|, After watching more hand to hand fight scenes over the years, I found out that the reason this fight scene works so well is that they barely even hit each other. Both Steve and The Winter Soldier know that a well connected hit can result in a loss so they do everything in their power to block each other's attacks. They don't just mindlessly attack each other and pop back up in a repetitive exchange of hits"
Captain Fantastic,"Captain Fantastic Official Trailer 1 (2016) - Viggo Mortensen, Frank Langella Movie HD",D1kH4OMIOMc,8839144,27885,1992,"This is one of the most eccentric and realistic movies I've ever seen. I am a sucker for indie films and this one definitely hits the spot. Viggo is an exuberant actor and plays the role of Ben Cash exceptionally well. The plot is one you don't hear about often, if at all. Definitely worth a watch. A solid 9/10.|, I cried like 5 times. And every single one of those times was out of joy. This movie is absolutely beautiful.|, I actually get pissed!! why aren't AMAZING movies like this getting more attention!! hands down the BEST film I've seen this year!|, ""What's Cola?""
""Poison water.""

I mean he's not wrong.|, Viggo Mortensen is a god damn legend. Truly one of the most underrated entertainers of all time|, This film is an absolute philosophical gem - I loved every bit of it. And it really makes you think after about our societal constructs and if it really is the ideal way, but also whether it's possible to go back to what once was.|, I wasn't expecting this movie to be THAT good. Daring, hilarious, touching and thought provoking.|, I am an  electrical engineer ..I was so depressed..i was searching for a job...after watching this move i was so motivated that i started farming ..and now i am leaving a happy simple life..❤️|, Just watched it. Brilliant, so many amazing scenes. Loved the one where they sing 'sweet child of mine' and cremate their mother. Also, it's interesting that their dad found a balance at the end  as it were and decided to send them to state school while still enabling them to live life surrounded by nature|, I've only watched the trailer and I'm already in tears. I have to prepare my heart for this. I absolutely love Viggo so much."
Captain Marvel,The Marvels | Final Trailer | In Theaters Friday,uwmDH12MAA4,11431517,109516,13963,"Using the OG avengers to promote this movie is CRAZY.|, I think we all owe Thanos a huge apology.|, Marvel really took DC's Batman phrase ""You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" to the next level|, Disney continues to impress us all with their new ride: ""The Downward Spiral.""|, As a wiser person than me said:

_”You know there's a problem when you're more excited for the reviews than the movie itself.”_|, “Black girl magic”

That is a line written by a professional writer…|, Yall remember the hype for every movie all leading up to Infinity War, good times|, I'm not even a hardcore Avenger fan but damn...I sure miss the good ol' days|, If you ever feel useless just remember there are 103k people who liked this trailer|, When Gandalf was like “Spuderman go get them tiger!”
Goosebumps"
Captain Phillips,CAPTAIN PHILLIPS - Official International Trailer,GEyM01dAxp8,3790710,19462,1198,"Just finished watching this movie. Almost made me cry. Truly an amazing film.....|, Just finished this movie and it was so emotional. I can't believe I haven't seen it till 2021. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Such a great performance by Tom Hanks.|, Out of all the movies I have seen regarding military involvement, the scenes in this film are my favourite. How the Seals are brought in and instantly on comms the whole time until they arrived at the ship is brilliant, seeing the way they handle this situation was incredible. They immediately took control, they installed ears on the boat, had full info on all the pirates. They stayed calm yet never backed down. And seeing the snipers set up before taking that final shot to ultimately win over the situation just brilliant. Great movie, extremely well acted and directed.|, Barkhad is a natural talent!To know that he had absolutely no previous exposure to acting before this movie and for him to act like he owns the place in front of a star like Tom Hanks..hats off!|, And people laugh at me when I tell them that Pirates exist. 🤦‍♂️🤣 Masterpiece of a film. Tom Hanks never disappoints. 💜|, I’ve seen this movie more times then I can count. Undeniably my all time favorite movie. Adbi 100% deserved his Oscar nomination but it sucks Tom Hanks didn’t get a nomination. The “You’re sage scene” should’ve been enough to get it|, Just watched this on DVD and I can't believe I did shed tears on two scenes: the one when Capt. Phillips was blindfolded and the finale when the doctor checked him out for injuries. The movie was fast paced that made it not boring to watch and of course my favorite  #tomhanks   performance as a drama actor was splendid. Got to watch it again sometime... watch this movie guys...
 #film   #movies   #blockbustermovie  |, You know a movie is good when in 2021 and it's still powerful...Tom Hanks’ acting is 2nd to none and those somalians actors were superb....|, Being a truck driver I thought I’d be sick of the sight of containers.

Cool flick otherwise 😎|, hello Tubi|, Terrible!|, Im so fucking glad they diffrentiated between a vampire and a strigoi.

Captive State,CAPTIVE STATE | Official Trailer | Focus Features,i68xCzI406A,7152664,13126,2026,"This was a very underrated movie and came in for a lot of criticism when the movie was released. Why that is I just don’t get. The actors are all rock solid and believable, even some of the smaller parts are just wonderful. John Goodman gives yet another standout performance. The story of an alien invasion is perhaps a well trodden one, but told from a different perspective, is highly plausible. The restrained use of special effects (perhaps due to budget), did not take anything away from the movie for me. Everything combined, including an excellent tight pacing, had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.|, Helluva movie.  Should've been a multi-year mini series.  There's a lot of complicated things that could have been more drawn out.  Very tightly written/edited.  Worth watching a couple of times.|, This movie was awesome...if you read between the lines...it mirrors what we are dealing with today...with people who pretend they have our best interest at heart in leader positions who don't.|, Skillfully told just enough story to keep me invested. I filled in blanks with other alien-invasion tropes, had no trouble following it, loved John Goodman.|, Great movie. It could be boring most of the time, but the twist in the end is amazing. Absolutely stunning. However you have to really pay attention to know what’s going on.|, This movie Is a masterpiece. Extremely well acted too and i appreciated this even more the second time i watched it, since i know its awesome ending.|, Looks like a really good movie.  I can't wait to see it.  Finally, some scifi that depict humans occupied by aliens in realistic fashion.|, Great movie, just strange to me that so many people are confused as to what's going on. The plot is intricate, I'll give you that, but it pieces together well in the end. Not confusing at all. A must watch if you like movies like inception.|, Excellent movie! This movie just reinforces the fact that if critics don't like it, it must be great|, one of the best sci-fi films in recent memory. all the stuff people complain about in the negative reviews are what I liked about the film. I think this will be one of those box office flops that turn into a creeper hit as the years pass"

je trouve ça cool :)|, Stromae is not a singer, he is an artist. He talks about real problems of the world and the humans. He leads his people by telling the truth by his art. Such a genius. Belgian people should know the value of him more. Greetings from Turkey to Stromae and French&Belgian people.|, Son clip est tellement impressionant par les messages qu'il transmet, et la réflexion qu'il nous oblige à avoir. 
Je suis en train de redécouvrir Stromae, et ça fait un bien fou|, I still remember that I was so traumatized when I first watched this MV maybe not understanding the true message of the MV at that time, but now I watch this 7 years later, the power that social media has and how people easily became slaves to social media is so true. This MV is well made even the little detail that the bird came to that little girl. This MV alert the danger of social media can happen to anybody with any age.|, Stromae was a genius for this one. ART!!!!🏆|, The song is great but can we also admire the Music Video.  It's so creative and I love how there are many hidden meanings scattered in the video that symbolise something. It perfectly depicts how social impact actually impacts our lives slowly. 

There are many artists who can make a great song, but Stromae is just unique. He adds so many elements to all his songs. Each time, the ideas he comes up with are just so out of the box. He never fails to amaze me.|, I'm so happy he's back. His music spans so many important topics. A voice we've missed all these years. Welcome back Stromae, thank you.|, He is incredible. Back then twitter didnt have the political power it has now. Stromae was ahead of his time.

edit: R.I.P twitter|, 7 years later and it's still relevant; it will be forever|, Après 8 ans, cette chanson résume le problème de la société et des écrans.

The story, the performance of both Cate and Rooney, the music, everything is so powerful and intense, sad and beautiful, real!|, Cate Blanchett has reached a whole other level of performance. She's going higher and higher and has raised the stakes so much that she has NO ONE to compete with but herself. 

Definitely the best living actress, IMHO. I wish she made more films along with her theatre roles.|, Is it bad i've already seen this film 11 times like i'm addicted it's such a perfect love story and Cate and Rooney are just flawless|, I just watched this movie and it's wonderful. Some scenes I found myself tear up just because the characters and the situations that they are in are so beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. I love both characters equally, that is so strange for me because I usually like one character more than the other. That just say how effective and gentle this film is.|, One of the best films I've seen. The acting, the storyline,the honesty, the love portrayed between the two lead actress is nothing short of wonderful.|, I watched the movie last night for the first time in a local cinema... It blew my mind. Seriously one of the best movies I've seen lately; it's so delicate but yet powerful and strong. It really talks about Love in its highest expression. Thank you cate Blanchett for this gift.|, Cate Blanched should've have won her third oscar for this amazing performance. Nobody will change my mind|, One of the greatest movies I've seen. It's simply beautiful and a beautiful romance. Loved both Cate and Rooney, so much chemistry on the screen! Can't wait to watch it again!|, Mara is truly a revelation and Blanchett's devastating scene really crushes the critics who said this movie is ""cold"".  You are watching a master at work when the different elements of a film are so cohesive and form this single vision of a director.|, Cate Blanchett is the greatest living actor"
Carrie,CARRIE (1976) | Official Trailer | MGM Studios,j9Mg-GRS46Y,565537,4809,273,"I watched the film again yesterday. It's hard to bear. Carrie symbolises the born loser. Who just has bad luck and can't do anything right. She would have been my best friend. It's terrible how everyone treats her. I find this kind of violence hard to take. There are people who live a similar life. I hate bullies, they trigger me more than some other people. It's perfidious how people can take such pleasure in suffering. It's cruel how people deliberately isolate a person because that's the worst thing, to make a social being lonely.|, A movie masterpiece of psychological horror. Brilliantly paced and superbly acted. The 2013 dvd reissue of the film has a great interview (from 2001) with Brian De Palma and the cast and crew.|, The more decades pass, the more one realizes ""Carrie"" has to be in the top 10 best horror films ever made...DePalma at his best!|, This classic should be shown to all schoolyard bullies as a lesson in “Karma” to scare the bejeezus outta them.|, This trailer is the ultimate spoiler 😂😂😂|, ""Carrie""(1976) is an excellent drama horror movie! The last part of the movie was intense, creepy and very dramatic!|, Back when they didn't care for spoilers 😂|, I watched the entire movie with this trailer|, Masterpiece! Classic!|, Wish I had telekinesis to get revenge on those who’ve wronged me at my former schools."
Carrie Pilby,Carrie Pilby Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Bel Powley Movie,nLiUc1OKKQk,726432,6352,283,"I really liked watching this. I enjoyed how it dealt with conflict and how it showed that she actually did understand a lot of what the adult world's all about despite how others made her feel. Yes in some regards she's childish but all the times someone was calling her childish was because they didn't get their own way aka the irony of the situation.|, I have already seen this movie and it is indeed fantastic. Spoke to the producers about it and they were huge fans of the novel. You could feel their love for it!|, It is one of the greatest films unlike those cheesy and cliché teen-ager films. I absolutely loved when Cyrus asked her middle name and she smiled because she was certain Cyrus was the one. It was heart-warming, made me smile when she smiled in the End.|, This is a wonderful movie! Highly recommend it! Finally, a character with a moral compass!|, She's such a great actress such a sweetheart I love her role here, it's a really sweet film, not completely cheesy, it has a good point and you definitely start to empathize with Powley's character.|, just watched it. it's a cute movie. the type of movies to watch very cozy with a cup of tea. the final line killed me tho... my god <3|, Just watched it on Netflix and it was a really good movie , heartfelt movie|, I just discovered Carrie Pilby movie on Netflix. I loved everything about it!!! Very very good movie!|, Her performance in Diary of a Teenage Girl was fantastic. Can't wait to see this one. Looks great!|, I just finished watching this movie, absolutely beautiful and worth watching. Cyrus and Carrie are so cute together, one day i hope to have a relationship like that :)"

A sexist narcissist who decided that, in an encounter not involving her at all years before, an adult woman must have been being taken advantage of because the man she was with was older than her. So she stalked these two digitally for months to dig up any little detail about their lives she could to paint her narrative of ""man is creepy violent scum, woman has no agency in her life ever""."

I also love how Dwayne Johnson is willing to poke a little fun at himself (and his former modeling career) by cheerfully sportin' the cheesy fanny pack in this movie.

I absolutely adored it. There were parts that made me choke up. It displays the good and bad in humanity, and is honestly heartbreaking to an extent. Chappie is just a child, and the director did a beautiful job portraying nurture. 

Five stars. I really hope there will be a second.|, The visuals are great , storyline can be heartbreaking but inspiring at the same time. The movie keeps the audience engaged all the time.

Can't wait to see it!|, The scene where he learns to regain his rhythm is both symbolic and inspiring because when we usually feel uncomfortable around our surroundings, we must push through and fight for a better change!!! 10/10!!! His legacy will be know and his artistic views will not be forgotten. He is apart of history!!!🎻|, I love how there's people out there who know the history(s) beyond what's taught in our classrooms. I love that those histories are coming to light. Keep them coming 🫶|, I've heard very interesting things about Chevalier de Saint Georges and am looking to get some of his music one day! He led quite an incredible life from music to fencing to getting involved in the French Revolution! I always thought his story was practically cinematic and made for the movies so I'm glad to see that now one is being released!|, A story 500 years in the making. When I discovered him after studying Opera as a Bass-Baritone being the only African origin male in my class I hoped fervently that one day his story would be told. I hope they inform the world that Mozart was his competitor and learned from his arrangements as well as from others.|, I am truly happy to see this being made. I’ve always found Saint-George’s’ tale, along with that of Dumas, to be riveting! That said, a story is not “untold” merely because you never read it.|, oh my gosh! This literally brought TEARS TO MY EYES! The Violin is one of my favorite instruments. This Actor is phenominal and so happy to see him flourishing. Loved him in Godfather of Harlem. This trailer was so Capitvating with Imperative messages and stories to be told. Whew! Cant wait to get my tickets! #Chills #Chevalier|, I’m so excited to see this! I don’t believe in obtaining all of your historical knowledge from Hollywood produced films, but I am glad that he is being introduced to the masses. There are so many more stories like this that need to be told!|, This was one of the best movies I've seen this year. Absolutely amazing! 💗"

Truly one of the best actors in my lifetime. What a phenomenal cast and acting. Standing ovation worthy!|, This is probably one of the best old time adaption movie i've ever seen. You would never have guessed that the main actors/actresses were not Russian. The way they played it, the accents, the culture, the tradition, they all did it so effortlessly.

I'm so glad the movie seems like it will do it justice.  Such a great cast!|, I've already watched the movie, and it's fantastic. To the brilliant story and characters, to the mystery of the killings. People complain about the accents, but it adds to it, it certain parts, actors and side cast speak Russian.

""You won't like it until you try it!""|, Really loved the movie, the strength of the citizens and particularly the women in this movie is truly inspirational...while its a fictional work from what I have observed of those from this region I see no reason not to see it as an accurate portrayal of them.|, This movie is so under rated. Incredible story and brilliant performances by all. It just proves how most critics haven't a clue.|, This was an amazing movie. Tom Hardy did such a good job with his role.|, Another fantastic, intense role played by Tom Hardy. No one's like this man. The rest of the cast is great too, so i'm really looking forward to this!|, I watch anything with Hardy in it; he's an exceptional gifted actor. The trailer looks really good as was the novel!|, tom hardy is one hell of an actor."

In that time I became a huge Beatles fan and I would listen to them all the time. Around that time I found this Cirque du Soleil show and instantly fell in love with it.

An absolutely stunning performance from Alfre Woodard and the rest of the cast. The movie explores the characters and the effect of death row executions in a very deep and heavy way. In a sense, every character in this film is looking for clemency.|, She deserves an oscar and the film itself deserves all of the categories, best director, best story, best everything. It's just a very strong, authentic and awesome film. Why didn't they producers or whomever publicize it more. So many people don't know anything about it. Thank God for The Daily Show. That's the only place that I heard about it.|, Alfre Woodard is one of those veteran actresses that you can't help but respect. Also super happy for Aldis Hodge, been a fan since the Leverage days.|, This movie is fantastic! Alfre Woodard was brilliant as always, but she was especially strong in this role. Perhaps my favorite project of hers. Wonderful performance by Aldis Hodge also. The film raises a bunch of interesting ethical questions about the politics of capital punishment.|, This was a beautiful film. It's sad it didn't get the recognition it deserves.|, I can't believe this entire movie was over looked by the academy.I mean not 1 single nomination,then again why am I surprised.Highly disrespectful to Alfre Woodard after all these years and great work she has consistently delivered throughout her now almost 50 year career,Phenomenal film❤|, It’s a damn shame this was overlooked by the Academy. For real, Alfre Woodard gave one of the top 5 best performances of the year.|, This movie is truly a hidden gem. Don’t wonder if you should watch it. Press play now. You will go for a ride of emotions that will have you contemplating many aspects of Capital Punishment, and the effects it has on everyone involved. Alfre Woodard was absolutely amazing in this movie, and Aldis Hodge will captivate you. 10/10|, It's been a long overdue, such an excellent actress like Miss Woodward being finally on the spotlight.|, Wow.

Earned all my respect|, This is such a rollercoaster of emotions. Exactly how a movie should be. It's an honor to have followed these films since I was born. thank you for this masterpiece.|, I love the shot at 1:13 with Jay and the clapboard. It doesn't come off as a scene with Jay, but rather a genuine, candid behind the scenes moment with Jason Mewes, just being happy.|, I grew up watching the Clerks movies, this one made me realize how much of a family these people are to me. Prepare yourself for uncontrollable sobbing.|, Back to the start. I wish I can see this but I'm stage 4 cancer and currently at the end of my journey.

Kevin Smith has  his own trilogy now, and it's great.|, So beyond happy to see them coming back. The last few years have SUCKED! Its so awesome to have something to look forward to. I can't wait to see it 🖤🖤🖤|, I’m seeing this movie when it comes out. The original Clerks is one of my favorite comedies of all time and I loved Clerks 2 I thought it was hilarious. This one’s going to be really good I have a feeling. Kevin Smith has been hit or miss over the last couple of decades as a director but for some reason he always hit it out of the park with Clerks. Both were really funny and this one will be as well but the original will always be the best at least in my opinion."

It is without a doubt the greatest film trailer ever made!|, This movie is not for everyone. But it is an incredible work of art.  For those who like artsy, cerebral films, this is a must see.|, I feel like this movie was way ahead of its time. I remember watching this in cinema with friends. People wanted a movie like the Matrix since it was from the writers and directors of it. People left disappointed, but my friends and I felt it was one of the best films we had ever seen.

I honestly can’t with how amazing this is.|, I think this is a movie that NEEDS to be seen more than once, perhaps multiple times, to truly understand it's scope, it's epicness. I've watched it a handful of times now,and each subsequent viewing shows me something else I missed or didn't notice before- even if only a subtle thing.

You'll see what I mean. You begin to appreciate it.|, The world wasn't ready for this movie yet. Such a masterpiece.|, Quite simply the finest film trailer ever created. Even 7 years on I keep returning to watch this and the whole thing still gives me goosebumps every time. A phenomenal achievement in editing and music design.|, This is one of the best movies of the decade. Easily the Wachowksi's best work, and yet it was shunned and misunderstood.

With a premise like that you'd expect it to be like a low effort straight to DVD movie but they actually decided to make this a real thing and I kinda love it!|, Genuinely one of the times I had the most fun while watching a movie. I didn't expect it to be this good, nor this wild and crazy. Definitely worth a watch.|, this movie was nothing what I expected and it actually went over my expectations by a lot once I seen based on a true story I was hooked and actually ended up loving this movie!! 🐻❄️|, Went to see this earlier and it's honestly one of the most fun times I've had at the cinema in ages 🤣 There were a good few people in the cinema I was at and from about 30 minutes in, every single person in there was wetting themselves laughing. 

if you love the sort of downright silly action horror films we used to get in the 90s (Tremors etc) then you'll love it. Not in a ""so bad it's good"" way either, this is genuinely good hearted fun that knows what it wants to be and who it's aimed at, and mostly gets it right.|, This movie was actually very good. It had the right amount of serious dashed with good comedy scenes! It's up there with Eight Legged freaks for me! I was surprised I found myself rooting for the bear most of the movie too, especially at the end though!  For those who don't know, this movie is loosely based on a real event of a grizzly ingesting about 75Ibs of coke but it died too quick to have even had the chance to hurt anyone thankfully, too bad for that bear:(|, Give this bear an Oscar. Not only did it do cocaine in such large quantity, it also didn't die of a heart attack immediately!|, Just watched this movie and I loved it! The whole theater was laughing. It's the perfect mix of gore and comedy. You've got to go and see for yourself, you won't regret it!|, This feels like a throwback to those 80s ridiculous movies I absolutely love.|, “Let’s see what kind of effect that has on him.” Has the same vibes as “what could possibly go wrong?” and I love it."

It started out super serious but hald way into the movie it turned into gold comedy. Maybe I just drank too much wine..but I really enjoyed this.|, Liam Neeson never disappoints! Another great action flick!|, I loved this movie.  It was very funny.  It also looked at the relationships between fathers and sons in the movie. Neeson's character is seeking revenge for the murder of his son but there is also the relationship between the drug lords and their sons.  Neeson's spree of killings set off a turf war between the two drug lords as both become convinced the other is behind the killings. Drug lord Viking micromanages his young son's life, strictly controlling his diet and his friends.

Now as an adult, naturally I'm curious of historical events that had huge impacts on the world. These videos are easy to follow and get the general idea of the subject. Sure there is a lot to unpack but I feel these videos do a great job of summarising the events"
Colette,COLETTE | Official Trailer,c_8U7gjb2k4,7504971,6329,410,"Keira truly does shine in period dramas. She kills it in Pride and Prejudice(one of my favorite films) and now seems to be doing just as good, if not better here! Good for her!|, Keira Knightley, the queen of period dramas. Can't wait to see her on the big screen again 💕|, Keira Knightley as a queer woman in a period film? My prayers hath been answered.|, I’d love to see this movie!  Breaking free from the mold they want us to be!!!  It’s a powerful message that ignites the spark in all us us to go after what we deserve!|, I've read several of her books, she was truly a fantastic author!|, Keira should of gotten a nomination! She was fantastic in this movie!|, I have a feeling I'm not the only one who finds this piece to be quite beautiful even though it has yet to premiere|, Knightly has been in many memorable movies.  This one is getting warm but not stunning reviews by the critics, you know, those who lament the dearth of movies not based on superheros and CGI. The film is a breath of fresh air.  It is on a limited release basis.  Colette is a period piece in place only, for its message is as current and germane to women's issues facing us today as anything I've seen in sometime.  This is a story based upon the most important female writer in French literature and who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.  As to whether or not Colette will be the role Knightly is remembered for, time will tell, but it certainly will be one of the films she is remembered for.  Do yourself a favor, go see it.  Just be prepared to have to think a little while you do.|, I'm excited for this, because I'm fond of 'The Duchess,' which also has feminist themes and also stars Kiera Knightley. 'Colette' looks as if it could be a kind of companion piece as well as confirm what I've suspected since—that Knightley's acting is aging like a fine wine; it's simply getting better with time.|, Keira Knightley is brilliant!!! I believe she's surpassed all her previous performances!"
Collateral Beauty,Collateral Beauty Official Trailer 1 (2016) - Will Smith Movie,isQ5Ycie73U,12022238,60049,3875,"I was the Domino Artist they hired to build the domino setups (like at 0:04-0:12) and let me tell you, this was the most AMAZING experience being part of the movie!!! The trailer looks SOO good I absolutely cannot wait to see it when it comes out in December! It's such an amazing feeling to see my domino art make it to Hollywood :)|, I have lost a child going on 3 years in November. I felt such a connection to this movie. Life is a precious gift, i have had to learn to accept things and to go on without my son, but the love he gave me and the memories have helped make me who i'am today.|, A beautiful deep movie with a twist.   It's not an action movie or a romance, its a movie for those of us that are trying to figure out how life can be so short.  Not the best performances but well acted nevertheles, Mirren faultless of course ... I don't understand the bad rap, made me cry for all the right reasons.|, I've just watched this and I can confidently say it's the most beautiful movie I've ever had the privilege of seeing, bravo Collateral Beauty.|, among many others, this movie is helping me getting trough child loss and it helps give hope on another level then therapie does, so objective ans jet so subjective ♡|, I cried about 6+ plus times throughout the film it is so powerful|, Wow, there's something nostalgic about this trailer. The way the movie looks and the how the soundtrack sounds makes this movie feel like it should have come out around 10 years ago, when times were ""simpler."" 
That being said, I'm there! Will Smith makes the best ""Oscar Bait"" movies!|, I loved it, I FRICKING loved it!!!! Watch it for yourself and ignore the critics. I almost didn't watch it myself but since I lost the vote 2-1 between my friends and I,  I did and it was amazing!|, Awesome movie. Only those who have lost a loved one can relate to it.|, I don't know why but when Keira Knightley appears as Love, it makes me tear up and I almost always cry (like a full cry lol). She really is kind of perfect to play ""love"", but its so weird because it's something I would never think about at all. I really want to see this movie when it is out and it is weird because I really usually hate emotional movies. It looks good, I hope it does not disappoint!"

Beautiful voice I love it ❤
Killing my vibes|, Love this one so much it's literally on loop all the time now!!!😂|, Why is this song not more popular!? I love her voice! it's magical ❤️
Edit: Thanks for the likes guys💌|, Eu amoo esse som|, The thing I love about this song is that it speaks for both sides of genders so I’m listening to it from a male perspective especially when it says “we can go all the time” or “wanna see you body on mine and collide” it’s just a really good song that’s all I’m saying ❤|, I just don't want this song to ever end . Can't express its magic and wonder in words. 😍😍😍|, I just love her voice is wonderful and calm ❤"
Colossal,Colossal Trailer #2 (2017) | Movieclips Trailers,fqcZtz8VXXE,4512883,27524,999,"This looks good and original, which means it's most likely going to bomb at the box office. And then people will wonder why there aren't any original films anymore.|, I bumped into this movie on Netflix years ago and I found myself rewatching it countless times because it’s so good! I love this movie!|, This movie was entirely different from what I expected. It was far darker and the message concerning alcoholism was very well done. I could not have predicted the outcome of this movie considering how it began. That's rare for me.|, Great movie. Was not expecting it to turn so dark. Original plot, fantastic cast. Highly recommended.|, Amazing film! Loved every minute of it, great story, original, really pleased I gave this a go , a must watch!|, Just finished watching the movie. A surprisingly mature film about addiction, toxic friends, and giant monsters! Must watch!|, Man the Pacific Rim sequel sure has a new twist.|, The end so emotional and annoying at the same time, but I really like it, simply so creative 👏👏|, Just rented it on my Xbox and stayed up to watch this movie.

So glad I did.
The trailer does a great job of hooking you w/o spoiling it. Wish all movies did this.

Great film with a great twist, and even better message. In the trailer, she readies herself for a fight. In the film, its a lot more impactful.|, I'm glad they didn't spoil it in the trailers.  Such a great movie."
Columbus,Columbus Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Indie,r3dcnV6Z9Zs,1357169,12479,539,"i loved how the director framed every shot in a way that the architecture was prominent,  making it feel like that the town was a character of its own.|, I really loved this movie. Their relationship was so keenly realized, and both of the actors were perfectly cast - it felt very real.
Even how the film highlights the sounds of the crickets and trees when they're staring at the buildings; it's so observant, because those sounds are a big part of the experience of standing in front of a beautiful building or place.
Does anyone think they'll get together later on?|, This is one of those ""out of this world"" type of movies. Only few see life this way. Not saying its good or bad but only we understand. Notice how they are the only two shown in the trailer, and the emptiness around the buildings as if they are alone in the world. Something about that seems beautiful.|, This movie is so beautiful and poetic. The architecture blew me away and it frames the two characters and their story so effectively. I really want to visit Columbus now, even though I live in Australia. The architecture looks absolutely stunning!!|, Just watched this film, I cannot believe this masterpiece has hid away from me for four years. This is not just a film, this is a piece of art. I think I found my new favorite film.|, I really enjoyed this movie as much as i enjoyed the Architecture featured. Two people with repulsing ideas on how they see life but brought together by space and time, figuratively. The heavy emotions of the two characters were complimented with astral musical scoring and the serenity of the linear structures. Every scene is breathe-taking, composition, cinematography and hues. There was such a nurturing balance of awe and sorrow.|, To me, this movie is like those few times in life when, by chance, you sit down with a good friend and time seems to slow down. When you have deep, vulnerable, meaningful conversations with each other. You reveal things to each other and learn things about each other and about yourself that you didn't know before. And afterwards, you see each other and the things around you differently. That's essentially what Jin and Casey do in the movie. Except they do it over several days and in the midst of some beautiful and stirring architecture and sights. The movie makes you reflect on family, duty, finding your path in life. It accomplishes that beautifully in my opinion. It's not for people looking for action, passion, and an adrenaline rush.|, I love how this film feels like a beautiful video essay that has its own unique wavelength-and yet so accessible-. 
It is a beautiful , warm and a poignant portrayal of subtle sadness of two very different type of people and how they try to close the Gap with such real conversation.|, _watched this film at 2 am & cried like a baby after it was over. what an incredible work of art._|, This is the most beautiful movie I have seen in a while. I keep coming back to this movie like every month or so, it’s almost always in the back of my mind. It haunts me beautifully ❤❤"

Yes I lost everything, but I gained so much more!!!!!|, I love this worship song God my King I love you, Jesus I love you, Holy Spirit I love you|, As a teacher of 10 years, I just wanted to say a sincere thank you for posting such uplifting music for me to use in my classroom while students are working.

Thank you SO much!|, - Even after 10 years, this song is ever relevant more in 2020. 🙌🏻👏🏻|, .still recall the painful moments I incurred in 2015..This song healed my soul❤🙌|, My beautiful church Worship team covered this song during a dedicated worship evening a few months ago and I had a vision of Jesus standing before me beckoning me gently with the most reassuring smile - to go with Him - which meant walking away from my abusive and drug addicted husband (who I was still holding in my heart) and allowing God to seperate our hearts and heal mine in that place all at the same time. Much healing was accomplished! Praise God for worship!|, Eleven years ago you sang this song. Today in 2022 God used this to speak to me in a profound way. Thankyou|, Come away with me

Come Play,COME PLAY - Official Trailer [HD] - In Theaters Halloween,LQwiqhdMQ7g,14573749,53451,3174,"Listen, this movie is worth the watch. It's not what you expect it to be. The moments of tension are so solid, the characters are fantastically human, and the emotional beats are incredible. I cried watching this. Horror that can make you feel a range of emotions and depths? That's good horror.|, This is not just a typical horror movie, it’s a story about the importance of having friends so you wouldn’t be lonely ,and the unconditional love of a mother 💖 The ending made me cry 🥺|, I watched the first 40min so far and this movie does horror really well. It doesn’t do cheap jumpscares. The jumpscares feel appropriate when they are revealed. The plot well is simple. There doesn’t seem to be any loopholes in it so far|, This was absolutely fantastic. I haven't seen horror this good for a long time. 10/10|, I usually avoid horror movies but if Gillian is in it I'm watching. There's no way she can make me sadder than what happened in Blackbird.|, My little brother and I just watched this and it was amazing!!!! I loved how it didn't have a corny ending like most horror movies and to me that just kills the entire movie idc about potential lol. I felt horror, sadness and happiness what a great watch!|, What excites me the most about this film is the moment at 2:16; I think creating an atmosphere of creepy is far more important than a jump scare. If this film is like this the entire time, I will definitely see it.|, IM SO GLAD THAT WE DECIDED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE! It’s definitely hard to find any decent horror movies these days but this one is definitely a watch! I felt almost all the emotions watching it, the characters are very realistic and were very well portrayed! 

That ending tho, such a heartbreaking moment 🥹|, This was SUCH a good movie, the suspense was insane, it’s so genuinely unsettling! It’s 1000% worth the watch it even got some screams out of me! By far the best movie I’ve watched in a VERY long time with some incredible twists|, Why does every scary movie look like it was filmed in the same house 😂"

And the pain gets worse depending on what I’m doing.|, Very informative video, great visuals but I hate the fact that they have used the word - 'damage' so many times. As a concussion specialist, I think it is very important that my patients don't start believing that they have brain damage. It is a functional injury and there are shearing forces to the axons and dendrites, the actual brain tissue is pretty much fine. Please also remind people that our body has the ability to heal itself and concussions can heal as well.|, since 7 years, after I got hit several times by a guy on my head, the shaking and hitting of my brain towards the skull has increased to an extent when normal jumping/jogging/tilting the head causes the brain to shake. I didn't feel this before concussion. It's really horrible and even I can feel the brain hitting the back side of the skull while walking on stairs. ANYBODY PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS!|, I believe my father experienced this as he was targeted screaming in his bed holding his head as if severe pressure was happening and he woke up with virtigo as well and got committed to a psych ward and was held for a week and was set to the hospital and suffered sever weakness and emotional problems and then died of a heart attack|, Its crazy our brain is just floating there like a extremely fragile pickled egg in a jar.|, I got a concussion playing rugby on July 16th 2022 and I’m still suffering from it today.

I’ve been out of work for over a month now trying to recover but it still won’t go away. I’ve been bed resting in a dark room with very limited  phone usage for 3 weeks now and although I’ve slowly been feeling better it still hurts and I’m getting frustrated feeling like this. I haven’t felt my self in over 3 months now and I just want to recover so I can get on with my life. Can someone help me?|, Hi everyone, I was hit by a gate 6 months ago. I was unconscious for about 20 minutes and had loss of memory for up to an hour. The symptoms I had were pressure, movement in my head and pain. I was given some painkiller drugs and an anti inflammatory drugs. The symptoms quickly disappeared after few weeks and I was fine for about 2 months.

What do you advise I do? What type of treatment do I need. It’s difficult to find a doctor who Understands this.

Please share your experience, what type of treatment did you undergo?|, Thanks! I'm an old RMT, and this was short and sweet, and exactly the perfect first video for me to start my morning, of trying to be a good ""Autodidact"". You've a new subscriber, this is shared already with a peer. Cheers!|, It’s important too see a doctor right away after an concussion. The reason is you could develop long term issues later on if you just let it go and not get the proper help in the healing process. If you are experiencing headaches , dizziness , memory loss , bad speech , nausea , loss of focus or basic motor functions like holding a pencil or a fork for examples you should really go see a doctor. Better to do it sooner then later."

I watched it randomly on a flight recently having never heard of it and was charmed. Funny, well written, and well acted - it reminds me a lot of the lovely mid-budget films we used to get before everything went to either streaming or franchises. Highly recommended, would love for them to make a sequel (but not holding my breath).|, It's good to see John Hamm and John Slattery working together again! They had such great chemistry on Mad Men.|, Aw, man. John Slattery and Jon Hamm in the same frame again. These two legends need more major roles. Untouchable actors.|, Low and behold, it’s already 1 year old!

This is a charming entry in the long dormant franchise 
Hamm is undeniably charming and he gets a lot of laughs with this sleuthing script 
The supporting cast is a lot of fun too with their banter and interpersonal relationships 
Sure the comedy isn't as grand as the first movie but Hamm's acting chops make this modern version of the character a joy to watch An amusing trifle even if disarming at times 
It's got a good amount of wit and sly humor|, Just watched this very well written and very fine film with an outstanding cast. Thank you so much for making this movie. I truly have not laughed this much since ...possibly MadMen. And thats a really long time! The writing is super funny. And everything is just very well put together. Jon Hamm does such a great job. Have really missed him as well as his Sterling counterpart. Marcia Gay Harden is really glowing and sizzles with gravitas! Love her Accent 😂 she reminds me very much of a relative and it was such a great caricature. That interview with Tatiana 😂 Jon Hamm he is such a character! The Dinner Party was absolutely hilarious too! The detective  😂 he is very funny. I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I actually was able to watch it and forget about my troubles the entire time...this is very rare for me. Usually I watch a film and get up and clean leave the room come back pause it turn it off watch it later....and mostly dont watch most movies bc I find them to be boring and uninteresting. This one. Not so. Far from it. Truly enjoyed! Mucho Grazie! Bravo! 🙆🌟👍|, How did I not know about this film until now? I love Fletch and Johm Hamm is surprisingly hilarious, if you haven't seen Wet Hot American Summer he's great in it and so is everyone else|, I really liked this. Make more Fletch adaptations with Jon Hamm|, I've only seen about 10 minutes of this movie but Jon Hamm is hilarious in this. Funniest stuff I've seen in a long time.|, I loved Chevy Chase's Fletch as a kid but Jon Hamm's portrayal is so close to the novel that I really hope they produce Fletch's Fortune next.|, Wow somehow I have completely missed this. The original Fletch movies are some of my all-time favorite movies. I didn't realize they continued to make more. somehow it just doesn't seem the same without a Chevy Chase"

Amazing film.|, From the trailer alone, to people saying it’s inaccurate consider this:
The events themselves are probably not. 
However, the portrayal of Sissi’s emotions, how she must’ve felt in each moment, probably the most spot on.
It’s not a documentary in the sense of the events and timeline being accurate.

These were financially and socially powerful, well spoken, well dressed Asians - something that is a rare sight to see in Hollywood. Coming from a South Asian.|, Just went to see the movie yesterday. I'm black, and when I first saw the trailer, it may sound silly but I felt a sense of pride for Asians because I know how important it is to see yourself represented for a change.  I went with my wife. Great movie, and great reviews!  I hope Hollywood learns from this that there's more to the world than black and white.|, It's wonderful seeing Asians in positive roles. And I personally love this movie. I'm African American and it's very cool seeing people of color in these situations in the movies.|, This movie is absolutely everything. Reasons:
1. You leave happy.
2. You come out wanting to marry a crazy rich asian bachelor.
4. Astrid. You'll see what I mean.
5. Henry. Still not over him.
6. Michelle Yeoh. The one real crazy rich Asian in the movie. She's royalty.
6. Awkwafina. Definitely.|, i just finished watching this movie and it called me poor in 1000 languages.

I mean look at the *Creative wedding, a river flowing when the bride came?*

*WOW JUST WOW*|, This movie was and is fabulous and beautiful. I loved the wedding scene, and I love seeing these beautiful people. And their culture being displayed in a beautiful manner. I had a feeling that I would like it, but I wasn't sure what to expect. Two thumbs up from me. I will probably watch it again.|, I wanted to be crazy rich asian as well, but unfortunately I'm just a crazy asian, and broke"

I’ll never forget it. Now we sing to it! This song and “Clover Cage - Warr Is Only Won With Love” are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times.

Only Rocky Balboa could deliver that line, knowing what he knew about the Drago family.|, I’m telling you all, this is a must watch! Just saw it literally 1 hour ago and it will hit you in the feels and pump you up|, “ If we don’t do what we love ... Then we wouldn’t exist .. “

- Michael B Jordan|, In 2018, Michael B. Jordan was in two different movies where he fought the son of the guy who killed his father.|, Creed trailers is a special type of art.
CAN'T WAIT!|, The part where he’s lying in the ring and starts punching the floor.. I can’t even describe how emotional that scene made me because you can almost feel his pain and frustration. AMAZING acting. 1:43|, I love the parallels, too. Drago training in the cold, while Creed's hardening himself in the burning heat. This movie was amazing.|, I just saw it last night. I don't care what the critics say, this was a fantastic sequel!  The story lines and parallels to previous films can truly be appreciated by die hard Rocky fans. Lots of emotional highs and lows in this one, and in my opinion, a perfect ending. I think this should definitely be the last film in the series."

I remember taking him to see Creed 2 when his health started to decline. Though I can’t physically take him with me to see Creed 3, I know he will be there and this will be a tough one to watch especially. But very excited for the progress of these films and Michael B Jordan is killing it. Stay humble folks|, I worked on this movie towards the ending of filming last year and I’m still pinching myself over it, such a surreal and positive experience, everyone involved was so dope 🙏|, I went to the cinema to watch this yesterday and it was an amazing film. I personally would say it's the best out of the 3 Creed films so far. I'd highly recommend watching it especially in a cinema on a big screen. That 3rd round between Creed and Dame at the end where everyone disappeared but them was mind blowing how it was filmed I was like a little kid again watching Rocky. Great film and for Michael B Jordan directorial debut it was a masterpiece.|, A fantastic trailer. You can sense dread when Damien shows up, and it becomes more and more clear that he is the greatest threat and a nemesis for Baby Creed. Even taking him under his wing, doesn't matter. This has a very realistic feel about it|, This will be incredible!|, “I need you to let go of your fear , let go of the guilt , let go of whatever was , and walk into what is“    POWERFUL|, That moment at 0:49 where Jonathan Majors switches from smiling to serious in an instant.

Crimes of the Future,CRIMES OF THE FUTURE Trailer (2022),xyCI741MqPY,793748,6996,861,"I'm more excited for this than I've ever been for a movie. I can't believe it has been since ExistenZ since we have had some Cronenberg body horror, but also for me it's not about the gore or sexuality. David Cronenberg has always had something to say and I have found that what he usually has to say reflects our culture more than we may like or feel comfortable with.|, I struggle to truely enjoy Cronenberg’s films but I appreciate that he always has a point to make. His film are articulate, intelligent and well acted. I do find him a very clinical, sober and uncompromising director. I find his films in general cold, distant and difficult to connect with but I cannot deny he is a master of his craft. I’ll always watch his films and appreciate them but have never felt it to be a pleasant experience…..something I think he intends. 

His warmest film emotionally for me was the Fly…..and that had inverted Gibbons(?) and a guy having appendages melted off. Go figure|, If you're a Cronenberg fan, you're a Cronenberg fan, and this has Cronenberg written all over it! From Naked Lunch, eXistenZ, Videodrome, to the Fly and Scanners, they're mind bending movies that challenge, amaze and leave a lasting impression. I find it harder to watch gruesome  stuff as I get older and since becoming a dad (I don't know something just changed in my constitution LOL), but I'll make an exception for this. He does sci-fi horror in a way that makes the unknown so exciting and terrifying, in a kind of Lovecraftian way!|, Who would have thought Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson would evolve into such intriguing and fascinating actors. both of them have been putting out solid work|, Cronenberg going back to body horror is like Beethoven going back to music.|, Ansioso para assistir o filme 😍|, I can't decide if i should watch the movie or just wait another 5 years to see it become reality.|, A movie for the whole family!|, very different, difficult watch but if you make it through, gives you a lot to think about. um, it even 'moved' me which might sound odd because the physical aspect of the movie makes one feel ill throughout; I think viewers who are born or become 'different', or become disabled, handicapped, really dehumanized (at least in my case), the movie might have a very different meaning to you, at least some parts, and though it's a harrowing experience, you will find the will power to watch it in entirety and think about it. there are people in the world who feel underrepresented in films most often about race and/or ethnicity; this film feels as if it was made for and speaks to humans who are physically different and the mental/spiritual adaptation (or film's phrasing ""evolution"") to the physical world and in particular continued existence in mainstream society.|, David Cronenberg is a legend when comes to making body horror films, can't wait to see this."

Not a horror film, a Gothic Romance with ghosts and blood, but mostly about the characters who represent a battle between light and dark, future and past, love and fear. The film's a beautiful work of art, don't expect a scarefest, that's not what it's about.|, this wasn't scary, it was frankly the most beautiful thing I've seen in a really long time. the details were sublime even the smallest moment was so well planned and executed perfectly. the contrast of the angular Gothic architecture to the soft curved lines of Mia gave such a strong impact.  my love for DelToro has grown by miles.  utter perfection 😍|, we need more gothic romance movies like this|, peopel have to understand that not every horror movie is going to be a keep you up all night & shot your pants, scariest movie you've ever seen. this movie was good because it was dark, the acting was on point. the scenery was amazing and there was a solid plot so don't hate in this movie just because it was all out gore and mayham|, A beautiful work of art - tragic and redemptive love. Top level acting, cinematography, costume and production design.  Gothic story filled with classic tropes and clever subversion.  Del Toro creates a whole gorgeous, creepy world that calls out to be revisited - great for multiple viewings, you see more each time.|, I just watched this movie and its so captivating. An absolute piece of art. The intensity of dark love and pure love can never be picturized so beautifully as it was done in this movie. Simply loved it.|, A GORGEOUS and brilliant movie,  Loved every minute.  Great acting.|, Pure gothic bliss. Wonderful movie - also flat-out gorgeous. Loved Mia, Tom and Jessica and the characters they played. Jim Beaver was also excellent.|, I don't care if most considered Crimson Peak boring to me it was a fantastic movie a throwback to old school goth horror films. I love the visuals and the Sharpe Siblings.|, This movie was amazing. The story is so intense and I throughly enjoyed the movie. It wasn't super scary or horrific, but more tragic, with some supernatural elements and slasher components. All in all, we need more movies like this XD."

Every one here is missing the fact that she didn't actually kill any dalmations in the Cruella movie. She was eccentric, and wanted people to think she was bad. In the Cruella movie, she actually grew a soft spot for the dalmations.|, To everyone who is sceptical about this because it's another Disney live action: give it a chance, this one is not like the other live actions and can be seen as a completely seperate original story and it's really great!|, ""I used to think my life was a tragedy... but now I realize its a comedy,"" Cruella|, This was beautifully done.

I remember the first movie that made be a fan of Mr. Eastwood. It was ""Any Which Way But Loose"", after that I watched all his ""Western"" movies and dirty ""Harry"" moves. I became an instant fan of his movie director career. If your a fan of his I encourage you to watch this at the theater, you'll  get that feeling my wife and I got. This were we met Clint in the big screen, and this ware will say Good-Bye,  Thank-you Mr. Eastwood.  P.S. Don't listen to the movie critics, this movie is not for everyone, I believe this one is just for the fans.|, Clint is a shining example of how even though we get older on the outside, inside we may feel as young as ever. You may become too old for a lot of things, but your never too old to be a badass.|, ""I used to be a lot of things, but I'm not now.""

You have and always will be, Clint. Always.|, The way that Clint Eastwood is still directing AND starring in films is an amazing achievement even at his age.|, Clint is giving us advice.

Cyrano,CYRANO | Official Trailer | MGM Studios,5e8apSFDXsQ,7000425,35164,2303,"""Children need love, adults need money.""

Yeah. I felt that one.|, I love this adaptation beyond the telling. It's so delicate, and the songs are so quiet, almost incidental. Dinklage's Cyrano is a revelation, wonderfully complex because yes, now there is the visible defect that goes beyond the easy false nose—his stature—while at the same time, the idea of Roxanne loving anyone else is absurd, because Dinklage is so handsome and charismatic whatever his height. As with life, what's really holding Cyrano back isn't his self-proclaimed ugliness, but his fear of being vulnerable and honest about his feelings. Just a gorgeous film.|, ""My fate is to love her from afar"" OMG the way Peter say it. He is perfect, just perfect for a romantic lead. I cannot wait to see this movie...bonus is a freaking MUSICAL 😍|, The moment where Roxanne confesses her love for Christian you can see the heartbreak on his face. Peter Dinklage is such an expressive actor that he doesn’t even need to speak to convey emotion. Can’t wait|, 'I will make you romantic. Will you make me handsome?' That line and especially the way Peter Dinklage/ Cyrano delivered it ...was simply heartbreaking. Beautiful in its simplicity and heartbreaking.|, Such an incredible musical, I wasn’t prepared to cry. Stellar songs by stellar actors and actresses|, So good to see Peter in a proper lead role. This here is one of the best actors ever.|, Such an amazing trailer! The timing, the transitions, the scenes they chose, the music... it's so perfect. I could just watch this trailer over and over again (which I have already been doing for months)|, I saw Mr. Dinklage perform Cyrano with the new group at Daryl Roth Theater. It was an intimate, smaller stage experience, and I was about 6 feet away from the stage. I can promise you, if this film holds up to that same standard of excellence, you will not want to miss it!|, “She must have the choice!” *FINALLY!!!!!* it’s not longer “let’s fight for her affections!” It’s “let her decides who she’s wants to love.” I’ve been waiting for this kind of emotional maturity in a movie"

I can't wait to see Krypto and his new team on the big screen!|, This trailer: ""They should call me Iron Man""

Eternals: ""That's Superman!""

Perfectly balanced|, You know, this might be worth a watch. I was expecting to see more of the traditional DC Super Pets, but nothing wrong with using new characters as long they're done right.

And the little girl, I see greatness in her future.|, This movie was so great. Anyone that admires Pacino will appreciate this movie. His personality really shines through.|, I love the John Lennon sentiment and use of the idea of being pushed into motivation by a Lennon letter.

Just great, and i will watch the movie just because of that.  
And the fact that Pacino is an amazing actor.|, This movie was great!! I loved every second. It made me cry and made me laugh, ths was simply incredible.|, Just finished watching this.  Say whatever you want, but this is one of Pacino's best films in a very, *very* long time.|, This movie was fantastic Al Pacino has done his best role in years really awesome movie|, This looks really fantastic. I believe that Al is going to release another great movie again. Seems like it's been a while!|, Great film. Pacino's best performance in years. Annette Benning is hilarious and Bobby Cannavale. What an actor! Everyone was great in this but those 3. Cannavale is starting to be my new favourite actor. Especially after his performance in Boardwalk Empire.|, ¡ Grande Al pacino !
me hiciste llorar, reír y pasar un muy buen momento en Cine Hoyts.

Dark Phoenix,Dark Phoenix | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,1-q8C_c-nlM,14497872,128685,14345,"Whatever Disney decide to do with X-Men, I will always have a special place for this X-Men in my heart. I'll never forget the likes of hugh Jackman as wolverine, James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart as xaiver and Michael fassbender and Ian McKellen as magneto.|, I love how incredibly fucked the timeline is for the x men|, I hope they keep Fassbender as Magneto in the reboot. He’s the best Magneto ever|, Although this movie seemed to disappoint a lot out there, personally I loved it. The Magneto fight scene on the train was awesome. Phoenix was one of my favorite characters growing up when watching X-Men on FoX every Saturday morning. Shes supposed to be very powerful. I just wished they had put more into her fight scene in the end... it was good, but a bit short, I wanted to see more. Cant wait to see the next one, we all know the Pheonix will rise again. Maybe to help the X-Men fight a new villan or villans...  Onslaught? Omega red? Mr. Sinister? AVENGERS?|, This actually looks cool.|, Watching this movie again made me realized that the movie wasn't even as bad as they say it was. It was pretty dark and a really good movie. Just had a bunch of flaws but it was still amazing. It just didn't deserve the hate it got.|, I am going to be cautiously optimistic for this movie. With this being the last X-Men movie before Marvel takes back the rights I really hope that it is good. At least for the sake of those of us who have stuck with this franchise for the last 19 years.|, Needs more Quicksilver. Evan Peters is outstanding! 😍|, So am I right in interpreting that Jean was using her Telekinetic powers to crush Magneto's helmet while he was simultaneously using his magnetic powers to stop the helmet from crushing his skull? Because, if so, that's kinda awesome.|, This film is actually good and it is worth seeing it. Sophie Turner is amazing."
Dark Skies,The Killer Plane That Nazis Were Really Scared Of,G7skMYM0DVU,165889,6007,214,"My Grandfather was crew on the Hampden. One mission they developed engine trouble and were separated from the rest of the flight. Returning to England (outside of scheduled flights), the guns on the coast shot the plane down. My father has a photograph of the crew standing in front of the downed plane, with a couple of farmhands (with pitchforks) who'd come to investigate.|, A lot of young men lost their lives on these raids and I sometimes wonder if, in my early twenties, I could have gone through what these men did.|, A plane that was in fact designed by a German, Gustav Lachman. He was arrested in January 1940 and contined to work for Handley Page from Lingfield prison. He bacame a British citizen in 1949.|, My uncle was an 18yr old Blenheim gunner.
As kids we were warned WWII was a taboo subject in his presence.|, My father worked on them at ""Fleet"" in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada.  He always liked the Hampden and wrote articles about it for the National Archives but did comment on the lack of room inside. He understood the pace of advancement of aviation wartime design.  Unfortunately, due to such pace, the longevity of many lovely designs was cut short, so we never really developed long-term love affairs with some pretty nice planes.|, I met a man who flew Hampdens on long range weather forecasting missions for RAF Coastal Command. The issue of relieving oneself came up and he revealed that there was a rubber tube in the pilot's cockpit for that purpose.|, The design of these WWII airplanes have always seemed  so beautiful.|, After withdrawal from bomber operations the Hampden was repurposed as a torpedo bomber and maritime reconnaissance aircraft until replaced by aircraft such as the Beaufort and Beaufighter, in September 1942 two Hampden TB.1 squadrons, 144 RAF and 455 RAAF were detached to Russia to provide cover for Arctic convoys from German surface ships, the personnel from both squadrons left in late 1942 but before leaving trained up Soviet aircrew of the Soviet VMF, Soviet Naval Aviation, to operate the Hampdens which the Russians did until mid 1943 when losses and a lack of spares finally stopped them.|, Hi Dark Skies, the main issue with the Hampden and it's inlined engines counterpart the Hereford, was that was no room for a copilot, he had climbed into the cockpit where his crew member, claustrophobia bekonds, had entered the fuselage, so there was no way that his crew members could pull him out of the pilot seat, if he was injured or killed|, 5:50  Wilfred ""Mike"" Lewis is my grandfather.  So damn proud right now....also he's Canadian, not British.  Flew with the RAF at the beginning of the war.  Oddly enough was shot down in a Manchester by a night fighter in Sept. '41 in northern Holland.  Spent the rest of the war as a POW"
Dark Waters,DARK WATERS | Official Trailer | In Theaters November 22,RvAOuhyunhY,7755623,20169,1494,"The only thing worse than watching a horror movie is watching a true story|, A true story very well documented. It portrays how large corporations whose fundamental principle is to profit and grow, become monsters that do not care for human lives. Its heart wrenching to discover that we are still paying the price.|, Great, powerful movie. Hats off to the lawyer who pursued this for over a decade and the work he did unrelentingly just so the truth comes out and justice be done. What a great man.|, I found this movie because of a movie review that I need to do for my final grading. There were several themes for the assignment, including water pollution, which I chose, so I ended up with this. The movie gave me the most rollercoaster drop feeling ever. The fear, the chills, the repulse, the anger, the gut-wrenching realization I felt throughout was eye opening. It made for a great movie review material, I got A+ but what I saw in this movie has made me distrust large corporations. The lengths they went to hide the dangers for profit, the way they silenced the ones who know, the lack of remorse towards their victims, and their feeble attempt at covering up their trail of crimes made my heart drop. The ending, with the music and the zooming out, made me feel so awfully small and insignificant, and so utterly helpless being led by advertisements and claims that may or may not be true. I highly recommend this movie|, I think we all need more movies like this!|, It is a shame that this movie was not nominated for an Oscar. The movie and Mark Ruffalo were really great.|, That lawyer has balls of steel! I’m glad all his hard work paid off.
It’s unbelievable how DuPont is still kicking after everything they have done.|, His acting was outstanding, almost made me cry. And if you see videos of Rob Bilott, you'll see Mark did a great job of personifying him. The purity..|, This was just such a good movie and so eye opening to me, who lives in Cincinnati and had no idea of the courageous acts of a few to expose such unethical, criminal, injustice! Thank you to all who worked on this!!!|, I literally just left the movie theaters and saw this! It was so good and eye opening. They did such a great job with everything!  Y'all have to see this I'm so glad I went. I would definitely see it again! Not giving away any spoilers"

He’s come so far and it’s criminal if he’s not recognized as one of the best drummers alive today.|, This songs feels as if it were off of the deliver us album. So glad my favorite band is still making music to this day. Been with you guys since mark of the Judas. Keep it up guys! Still miss Ryan Perrish and Kris Norris.|, Almost 30 years and still putting out music that pushes the genre forward. Unreal. This rules|, No other band in existence does melodic riffing the way Darkest Hour does!! Welcome back!|, So hyped!!! We are ready!!!!|, Thank god this band still making Metalcore with that melodeath touch 🙏👌🔥|, This band is criminally underrated.

AMAZING!|, This movie was great. One of the best movies i ever seen. It was unpredictable and fun to watch. I dont understand how all these people are critisizing it for no reason|, Watched this today, & can honestly say it's the best movie of 2014 so far. Better than Godzilla, better than Xmen. This movie had everyone on the edge of their seat, gasping and cheering throughout the movie. I haven't been so emotionally drawn into a movie in a very very long time. This movie far exceeded my expectations. Literally was ""moviestruck"" after I came out the theater. Truly incredible film. MUST WATCH!! P.s make sure you've watched the first one before you watch this.|, This movie was masterpiece...It has emotions,family,war and deep message💖|, This movie reminds me of shakespearean works. It hits every plot and emotion brilliantly. Let's admit it, a movie about intelligent apes wielding firearms on horseback seeking war in an apocalypse is a pretty far fetched idea that in the wrong hands could have gone horribly wrong. The director, cast and CGI have made this movie an incredible story to experience.|, All of these three movies are amazing but somehow progressively get better. Probably my favorite movies of all time.|, Absolutely loved the movie and went higher than my expectations!|, We saw this film today, it was extremely intense and awesome, intellectually and emotionally stimulating, way better than we had thought it might be from the trailers.|, I knew Koba was gonna be trouble even in the first movie. This looks like it will easily be one of the best movies of the summer. With all of the action movies that are pumped out each year, this franchise is really set on a great course.|, These movies were incredible achievements. Andy Serkis is fantastic as Caesar. Koba is a fantastic villain.

I cant wait to see the virus evolve again and create the mutant humans with telepathic super powers as seen in Beneath the Planet of the Apes."

I can't wait for this movie!|, A much better movie than expected. Intense, subtle chemistry and an understated intelligence.|, One of the most underrated movies ever . Such a masterpiece . My favorite movie of all time .|, This is such an amazing movie yet soo underrated! Screw these so called critics. I had such a great time watching this movie. I literally had to get High for this. The 2 main leads Colin and Naomi and their chemistry are DOPE 🔥|, I like the Vertigo homage. Some of the slowmo shots though... seemed choppy. I don't think it was effect, but rather lack of equipment.|, Not to mention a great movie, this trailer is spectacular. The music with the visuals is a masterpiece. Starting at 2:05 I'm nothing short of blown away. Going down that staircase, it was beautiful|, very underrated movie. originally thought it was another dumb thoughtless action flick but its actually relatively smart and solid action scenes.|, Terrance Howard always does a terrific job in representing the role of his character and any film but he was cast in.... ""From hustle and flow"" to ""dead man down"" he has done an excellent job with class & understanding of what character would do in real time👍
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Five Stars |, Its crazy to see how many great movies come out each year that we don't even hear about.|, great movie, good story, no unnecessary killing and explosions...good job Colin Farrell"

Gets me
Every time|, Let's give a shout out to the beard dude who got kicked out of the back. Man is dragged down the freeway, holding on to a speeding car doing 65, resulting in the mother of all road rash, but still climbs back in and tries to take Deadpool out. Like, props to you, bro. Major props.|, The best thing about this movie is that it struck the perfect balance between being funny and being serious. One of the best examples of this comes from Deadpools 4th wall breaks. From a serious standing point he is a crazy assassin who thinks he can see the fourth wall, from a funny standing point he is an actor who is allowed to poke fun at the product he is working in. You can interpret the movie however you want without ruining the story, giving it extremely wide appeal!|, Probably one of the strongest opening sequences in recent film history. Really nails the tone from the very start.|, Deadpool is like one of those happy anime characters where once he acts serious, hes like a total badass|, I don’t know how these movie directors always manage to find the PERFECT actors for these roles. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Ryan Reynolds as Dead Pool, Chris Evans as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. All so perfect it’s almost unbelievable. There will never be a good replacement for any of these characters, and that’s just scratching the surface.|, You can’t even see his face but you tell that he has a smile the whole time.|, Ryan didn't even have a script, he just slapped on some red suit, took a camera, swords, and went to the highway.|, 1:16 “have you seen this man?” Is the funniest line for me.|, 2:24 ""Shit. Did I leave the stove on?"" always gets me every day. 😂😂❤"

I liked the first one, but I LOVED the 2nd one|, I struggled to hold back tears at the end of the movie. The script was brilliant and I love how Ryan Reynolds used his new powers to save his own career!|, This was one of the best movies lol. From the beginning sarcastic credits to the very end. I do love Ryan Reynolds. His humor seems so natural and it works so well. I still can't stop laughing.|, The movie was so cool so many nostalgia moments ...and the post credits just wow just wow 😂😂😂 you sure are gonna love it...this movie is unconventional like previous one and just perfect with those fourth wall breaking dialogues..|, The requirement to play a FOX superhero character:
- Tough
- Morally flexible
- Young enough to carry their own franchise for 10 to 12 years|, GET READY FOR THE SECOND COMING!|, One of the best sequels ever made...well done to all, loved it! Not bad for a trainee.|, I have a feeling this movie is going to be even better than the first one, and I honestly didnt think that was possible.|, I like how they hype the X Force only to kill them."

Dear Evan Hansen,Dear Evan Hansen - Official Trailer [HD],g_c_Jd-hP-s,23181285,126495,9459,"Don't mind me.... just tearing up with the stupidest grin on my face over this trailer for one of my all time favorite musicals....|, Always love when they show the whole movie for a “preview”|, Love how they made a 27 year old actor, through makeup look like he truly is 35.|, I had horrible acne as a child and teen. Even a teacher once told me that ""it looked like my face was on fire and they tried to put it out with a pick axe.""  The things the kids said to me were worse. I am 60 now. I have been married to my best friend for almost 40 years. I am far from perfect, but each day I try to be a better person. I try to lead by example. We are all in this together, whether we want to believe that or not. I am so glad there are songs and stories and movies like this. I felt very alone and thought of suicide daily. I am exhausted from living, but can't wait to see what tomorrow has in store for me. Be safe people.|, When I saw this movie, I completely broke down in tears. Speaking as someone who went through a crisis when this movie came out, I’m glad to see a movie that shows people who are alone that the aren’t really alone.🥺😢|, This movie had me crying throughout the whole movie. Different types of depression and how people try to cope with their struggles, it’s heartbreaking. The parents view and family members struggles trying to keep their lives above surface, finding closure. As a parent I struggle to try to make my kid feel better, and it’s so hard, with all the ups and downs, depression is invisible to the rest of the world but it’s so hard for the person with the condition and for the family members, it’s like walking on eggshells constantly with the fear that you can lose your beloved, and one of the two most precious people in your life. May the Lord give us strength to endure and be victorious over depression. We’re not alone, God bless you all!!!|, This is my favorite musical. It stopped me from suicide and got me out of self harm. I’m so excited to finally see this story get brought to life in front of so many more people than a show could do. Thank you, Evan Hansen. -sincerely Kaiden, and sincerely me.|, I am sitting here in tears..... and not because of the amazing performances portrayed in the trailer, but because of an experience that I had in my High School years...... I had an acquaintance named Mark ..... he was picked on and largely ignored when not being ridiculed..... He was from a family of Italian immigrants..... In my Junior - Senior year he would hitch a ride with me on the odd occasion i had driven my Mom's car to school, as he lived in a different neighborhood on my end of town..... In the last week of school he came to me and we exchanged yearbooks..... I wrote him a nice note acknowledging our friendship, etc., ....... Two years later i received a phone call from a barely intelligible woman (heavy accent) ..... She identified herself as Mark's mother..... She informed me that Mark had passed away (unbeknownst to me he had been born with a heart defect, which had foreshortened his life...... Mark's mother told me that she found my name and phone number in Mark's Yearbook, and that (get this) I was the only one who had signed it...... She said that she just wanted to let me know and to thank me for having shown kindness to Mark ....... I spent the better part of the rest of that day weeping over his passing, and over the realization of how important it is that we treat others as we would expect to be treated ourselves...... Two years later, I decided to become a Public School teacher, and spent the next 35 years carrying ""Mark's message"" to over 3,000 students (Grade 7) who passed through my classroom.|, As someone who's struggled with depression, seeing this trailer has made me feel so conflicted. Genuinely looks like a good movie|, But all other things aside - which I think are minor quibbles, Dear Evan Hansen despite its flaws & not being a ‘perfect musical’ does address the current issues of: loneliness, isolation, mental health, suicide, grief in all its stages and forms. It shines a light on those among us who are “living lives of quiet desperation” and even if only for that reason alone, IT DESERVES TO EXIST AS A PIECE OF THEATRE & CINEMATIC ART."

Ebony is the only one off her meds.|, Spencer is so in character it’s scary. She became an actual goth girl for this dungeon.|, When I ran this for my group I changed things up a bit. When the group made it to the attic and found the children, the children asked the group to come play with them before the group all pass out and awaken to find themselves still in the attic but something is not quite right when they  realize that they are in the doll house looking out the window to see their bodies unconscious in the attic. They are forced to play hide and seek with dolls of the children and in the process find the hidden door to the basement and the child apologise for trapping them in the doll house and explain that they have been alone for so long and that the monster will not let them rest in peace.

I changed the mound to a mound of flesh with the baby brother at its core.|, 4:15 Jacob's face as Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Ravenway introduces herself. The look at the camera.

Just some friends playing a module for fun. Good video guys. Keep it up|, The first time I played through the death house, my DM turned the Shambling Mound into a giant flesh monster and it was both horrifying and amazing at the same time. I heard someone give this as a suggestion in the end and as a player, I can honestly say that that definitely left an impression. I was so excited for the rest of the game!|, Jacob: Make the edgiest character you possibly can.
Spencer: *My Time Has Come*|, Death House was actually my first experience into DnD! Absolutely loved every second of the campaign and I got what my friends called a legendary moment! What a first impression this game left on me!|, There is a better monster to use in place of the specter: The  Indentured Spirit from Ravnica. It still does 3d6 damage, resists everything, passes through walls etc, but it can't drain max hp and it has less hp. It's still CR 1, but it actually belongs there. Lore-wise its somebody who died indebted to the Orzhov Syndicate and now has to keep working for them until it pays off its debt. I don't think it's at all a stretch to say you become one if you die owing money to your evil cult leader boss."

I don’t care what people say about the lead, or how certain actors and actresses were “wasted”
The story was told incredibly well, the visuals were amazing, and it genuinely had me guessing all the way up until the reveal. 
This next story looks to be just as beautiful and intriguing, and I honestly can’t wait to see it|, I freaking love all of Agatha Christie's novels and I especially love the Hercule Poirot ones so I'm super excited for this one 💚|, Saw this movie yesterday. Great movie and visuals. My only negative point would be that the killer was wayyyy too easy to figure out. My friends and I guessed it right away and we all thought: “there's no way it's that easy”, but we were wrong on that last part, it was THAT easy to figure out.|, It's a solid 8/10 from me. I felt it took a lot of liberties hence my lower rating, but the manner in which it was filmed, well casted, and excellently scored, made it a great experience. It is truly a new era for Poirot, and I think it doesn't degrade the source material at all.|, “You accuse me of murder?”
“He accuses everyone of murder”
“It is a problem, I admit”

The 2 hour runtime is the only issue which makes some of the scenes and storylines a bit rushed. Much better than most other detective movies which tries to portray the lead as action stars. 
An intelligent story with enough twists to keep you engaged. Some of the clues left early in the movie that are easy to miss and more importantly some which you think are absurd and unrealistic plot holes will all make sense at the end when it all interconnects.|, Oh my god the Cinematography in this is amazing and the person who did it deserves a raise"
Death on the Nile,Official Trailer | Death on the Nile | 20th Century Studios,dZRqB0JLizw,20553965,181440,9164,"Glad movies like these are starting to come back to theaters.|, The 2017 version of Murder on the Orient Express was incredible. I don’t care what people say about the lead, or how certain actors and actresses were “wasted”
The story was told incredibly well, the visuals were amazing, and it genuinely had me guessing all the way up until the reveal. 
This next story looks to be just as beautiful and intriguing, and I honestly can’t wait to see it|, I freaking love all of Agatha Christie's novels and I especially love the Hercule Poirot ones so I'm super excited for this one 💚|, Saw this movie yesterday. Great movie and visuals. My only negative point would be that the killer was wayyyy too easy to figure out. My friends and I guessed it right away and we all thought: “there's no way it's that easy”, but we were wrong on that last part, it was THAT easy to figure out.|, It's a solid 8/10 from me. I felt it took a lot of liberties hence my lower rating, but the manner in which it was filmed, well casted, and excellently scored, made it a great experience. It is truly a new era for Poirot, and I think it doesn't degrade the source material at all.|, “You accuse me of murder?”
“He accuses everyone of murder”
“It is a problem, I admit”

Deepwater Horizon,Deepwater Horizon In Their Own Words (Full Episode) | In Their Own Words,vbl7QeqfE-Q,1771529,16968,1128,"I worked on the Horizon for two years and was on crew change when this occurred.  I can attest that these men and women in the video were first-class and wonderful people.  My heart still aches for the 11, and I think of them often.  JS--Rig Mechanic|, felt like learning something today. I didn't think I would learn something like this. How powerful. When it's on the news, it doesn't feel personal(unless it's affecting you.) and if it makes you upset you can turn the TV off. But the lives of 137 people and their families were massively affected that day, and this puts it into perspective. It's amazing how even in the face of danger, risking their lives in a way they hoped they never had to, the personnel onboard the horizon forgot themselves for a while and assumed their emergency responsibilities. what amazing people. To the rescue crew as well...must have been terrifying to approach that monster.|, Two things that get left out of this story. The big one being, another rig was brought in. They directional drilled into that well bore. Killed the well, and plugged it. That’s amazing if you really think about it. The other is, the news kept reporting gallons per day flowing from the well. We don’t count fluid by gallons in the oilfield. We count by barrels. The news kept saying 60,000 gallons. It was flowing 60,000 barrels a day.|, I worked in the fishing industry in the gulf when this happened. It was so horrible seeing all the wildlife and marine life fighting for life. Not to mention the financial emergency it put us all into due to the fisheries being closed for so long. Many were going to the Atlantic or to the pacific to try to make a living. Long ride on a boat with a catch.|, My husband survived a blowout. Eerily, his rig was not far from where Horizon was.  Until I heard from him, I was a bundle of nerves. Pictures of the rig afterwards were scary. So much heat, it melted the derrick. When it first happened, the company he worked for called families to tell us about the blowout. Without any tact, they said, “we don’t know if there’s any survivors.”|, Fantastic group of heroes who leapt into action to save every life they could both on and off the rig.|, The jobs people do for a paycheck!!
My heart goes out to the wives, children, and all the family members enduring that loss to this day. Many thanks to those brave people trying to rescue survivors while witnessing the biggest fire they've ever seen...that there is integrity 👏!!|, My son was on the DH several times. He had just gotten back to shore from different rig job when the DH exploded. RIP in the deep to the 11 workers who perished. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🕯🕯|, I just watched the movie ""Deepwater Horizon"" so it was very powerful to listen to the actual people that survived this disaster.|, Worked for ODECO back in the 70's and knew a lot of the men who worked on the rigs.  They are a special breed of men, great workers who know how dangerous their jobs are.  God bless them."

- Davis

A nice emotional movie.
The character portration of Davis was so realistic.
If you are looking for a movie that is unique from normal drama. This is for you.|, Although it may not appeal to broader audience i found it to be smart, kind, subtle and very subversive picture. Its unique storytelling, gorgeous cinematography and corky characters are what really impressed me here. At first it may look pretentious and self indulging, but i thought that it was a superb metaphore about a man who in its own unique way of grieving finds some type of catharsis. Acting is good, dialogue is clever, there are more than few jabs at todays society that work and while some parts of it are familiar and predictable, the way the story is told felt fresh and different. 3.5/5|, This movie is sooo underrated. It's a perfect movie and I can't believe Jake Gyllenhaal hasn't got an Oscar yet.|, This was a fucking sick film. Trailer doesn't do it justice. Anyone who went through this knows how true and relatable it is"

WOW for Christian Gudegast's direction and screenplay.

The story is knitted with so much details, and the direction makes it so engaging that you have to be alert at every single moment so that you do not miss anything, something like that I felt while watching Interstellar. It is not a easy watch, but if you put a little effort its almost impossible to divert your attention for one second. The story has the essence of Byomkesh Bakshi created by Sharadindu Bandopadhyay, but also its new addition and charm woven brilliantly into the story. Respect #DibakarBanerjee.
With my little knowledge about cinematography I found some amazing camerawork. Sometimes the camera takes you towards the scene but then decides to take separate route than the direct one , so you sit with your heart pumping at your throat with a eagerness to reach there.
 And the production design, I mean really how can you create a Kolkata that existed 70 years back so convincingly? I want to know how much money was invested for art direction :P 
All the actors were good. Neeraj Kabi deserves a special mention.
It loosens up a little while it comes to the reveal the mystery, but you forgive that because of what you have already received. In one word, it was a treat to watch.|, I think we should all demand his all movies to be screened again on theaters to give him a tribute|, I watched this movie literally more than 70 times. But sadly, this is a highly underrated movie. It deserves a sequel. When will they realize a STAR based movie is just going to be overhyped garbage most of the times. The audience needs to value a good story over so-called STAR actors.|, He is not just a detective. He is a Bengali icon. He is Bengali's emotion.

Disobedience,DISOBEDIENCE | Official Trailer,HEVonh8bjC0,9343660,35420,2669,"Anyone else loved how profound Esti's husband's character development was? At first Fruma was my favorite character but then Dovid's questioning of the community's definition of freedom punched my heart|, Finally saw it at a local film festival last week. Twice. Brilliant movie. Absolutely stunning. It was fraught with tension and emotion and the director's choice for not using a score or background music for certain scenes really amped up the feeling of repression and struggle the characters were going through. I can't wait to watch it again when it comes out on DVD.|, Definitely one of the best well written movies I had watched. Love all the casts and their performances!|, This movie is just incredible. The cast is stunning. After watching this movie I can call Rachel McAdams not just extremely talented (that I had always known), but really one of the world’s greatest actresses of the 21st century. Huge thanks to the director, to both Rachels and to the whole team for this precious Wonder!❤❤❤|, Rachel Mcadams should definitely be an Oscar nominee...! Such a great performance!|, This is finally available on Netflix (U.S) and it’s absolutely mesmerizing. What a deep system of emotional roots woven so tightly through the foundation of this film that I often found the suspense to be palpable. My heart shook.|, Saw this last night and I haven’t stopped thinking about the film. Absolutely stunning performances from the Rachel’s. Their scenes together are powerful|, It's been 6 years now and I just rewatched this movie an hour ago and I'm glad I had watched it again. I finally able to understand it more now that I'm older and have different opinions. I am satisfied with the ending. They may not end up together but they both have their freedom to choose especially Esti. Esti also promised to tell Ronit her whereabouts in the future so there's a huge possibility that they will reunite again.|, I just now watched this film, and I honestly loved it, I think it was genuinely good, and that it really shines a light on very legitimate issues/struggles that go on within - not just the orthodox Jewish community, but in many religious communities.

I read in the comments that the movie is quite different than the book, though. That, in the book, Estie essentially comes out to the synagogue, but chooses to repress the fact that she's gay and still stay married and live as a straight woman, because that's what aligns with her religion. And that is actually (unfortunately) a much more accurate representation of what often happens in highly religious/conservative communities like this. 

I will never forget a conversation I had with my father years ago, because his answer and the way he said it was just so chilling to me. I was raised highly conservative/Christian (in an offshoot of pentecostal). I got out when I was around 17, but my parents continued to pressure me. Anyway, In one of the many conversations/arguments with my dad, I said that people are not turned gay, that they are literally born gay, and without hesitation he said ""I know"". I just stood there for a moment, then asked him ""well if you know God creates people to be gay from birth, then why do you believe it to be a sin?"", and again, without hesitation, he said (this is a summary, btw) ""God creates murderers and pedophiles, too. Just as they have to resist their urges to sin - to murder, or to assault children - gay people have to resist their urges to sin, too. It's just their cross to bear"". I was like ""So... you absolutely believe that gay people are born gay. That God creates gay people. But you think that they ALL should just have to live loveless lives? 😳"" and he was like ""Yes"" - dead serious. 

This is legit the way a lot of religious people think. And unfortunately, the queer kids who have been indoctrinated in this sh*t from birth often grow up to be brainwashed into believing it themselves, and living lives full of inner torment. It's deeply sad, and as someone who has a lot of religious trauma too, it's also utterly infuriating. I am beyond tired of religion sinking it's claws into children and destroying them before they can even become adults. Smdh.|, this movie is freaking AMAZING!  wasn't a fan of both rachels before but now, ughh!  i can't stop craving for their movies! rachel mcadams truly deserves an OSCAR for this. I fell in love with both rachels! their acting in this film was so believable/convincing and powerful. the chemistry is so palpable! and the story was very well told.. thumbs up also  to sebastian lelio!"

All his damn novels are best sellers he's a freaking genius|, The amount of people that slept on this movie is criminal|, The fact that the director brought a bond between both Stephen King and Stanly Kubricks vision makes me appreciate this all the more. That long standing disappointment of Kings opinion on Kubricks work has always made me sad. I've read the books and seen the movies. They both were masters at their craft. And this brings it all together in a weirdly heartwarming way.|, One of the best horror films I’ve seen in a long time. The actors absolutely nailed their roles and brilliant work by Mike Flanagan|, People will appreciate this film as a classic years from now|, Never imagined it was even possible for a sequel to the Shining . My first clue was that It was written by the Master himself Steven King and but somehow when I saw Ewen MacGregor cast as the adult Danny - well it was explosively excellent ! I read the original Shining decades ago and of course there are significant differences between Kubrick’s film and the book . It’s Kubrick’s production money and screenplay and seeing how he’s one of the greatest film makers whoever lived - he added his own touches . Those ******* sisters in blue dresses and terrifying hallway with Guilded Age wallpaper , I don’t recall them being a focal point of the book but as a Kubrick disciple and after streaming it again last night for who knows how many times those ******* sisters still creep me out thank heavens Kubrick had them in very fast shots but thier bulbous protruding skulls I can’t take it still . 💀💀|, I was not prepared for how great this movie was.|, They did such a great job with this movie. The book is a sequel to the book of The Shining, which is vastly different to the Kubrick movie. But the movie is one of the most beloved horror movies ever, so they couldn't just forget all that. Loved the way they adapted the Dr Sleep story so it was a sequel to both the Shining book and the movie!|, “Based on Stephen King's best-selling novel”
Has he ever written a novel that DIDN’T became a best-seller?|, just finished this book after reading The Shining for the first time. Loved it! Heard there was a Dr Sleep movie too and had to come see if it looked good. It does!"

Both movies were pure gold because it was written in a way where either the whole cast were villains or they were all victims in their personal circumstances. Stephan Lang is incredible! This whole movie was him confronting his own demons as he came up against people who were just as insane (morally) as he is and only to be defeated by them in the end, was the BEST way to end the movie - it made him realise truly how much of a monster he really was when faced with monsters like himself.

One of the best Nic Cage performances this year!|, You say this might be too weird for the Academy. But remember, last year's best movie award went to _Everything Everywhere All at Once_
There is hope for Cage being recognised for this!|, This movie is two parts Twilight Zone, one part Black Mirror, and more proof that A24 is our most innovative Hollywood studio working today.|, Dude, that scene you mentioned had me and my wife in tears. There were only a few other people in the theater and NONE of them reacted, so we were sitting there trying to stifle our laughter so as not to bother the others, but man, it was insanely funny.|, I love that A24 is slowly becoming the new prestige of production studios. I can’t remember the first time I noticed that movies I loved seemed to all come from A24, but ever since I’ve ALWAYS been interested in everything they produce.|, This movie has a very interesting premise that actually can be done with every genre. With a comedy, an horror movie or even a thriller movie|, The description for this movie reminds me of a short film I saw a years ago called Sequence.  It was about a guy who wakes up one day to realize that everyone has had the same dream about him, and pretty much everyone is afraid of him.  I won't spoil anything for those that want to see it, but I recommend giving it a watch.|, Anything nic Cage does nowadays is amazing. He really went from mediocre movies to some of the best movies of the last 10 years.|, Not only has this movie gotten plenty of great buzz from advanced screenings, but I was already willing to watch it both due to starring Nic Cage and being from A24.

The story, the actresses, the chemistry and the little details make this film a little gem!|, Wow that was hurtful to watch. How manipulative Sergio was towards Nima. How she crossed her boundaries. How self centered she acted when Nima cried that she needed a break. How abusive she was by locking her in her own bathroom. How she doesn't respect privacy at all. How she gaslighted her especially in the end. She was such a toxic person, I'm so glad Nima didn't get back together with her.|, I think that it was like they skipped the whole getting to know each other part of dating (or at least Sergio did) and went straight in for the real thing within 24 hours.

Dude deserves it so much.|, This movie could actually be the catalyst for another surge in share price and I'm ready for it.|, Didn’t expect to like this as much as I did! Lots of fun moments, not too preachy with the info - memes tastefully integrated and the story stays shockingly true to life, down to recreating sets, keith’s costumes, and Keith’s speech in detail. No brands or big names are hidden here - YouTube live and youtube studio are shown on screen as well as popular tik tok dance songs of the time, all building up a layered world of the film that makes it serve as kind of a time capsule for this mind boggling post pandemic story.  Lots of fun banter between characters you come to love (and hate) - a few of the film’s jokes might be lost for people who weren’t chronically online during that time, but I appreciate the little winks and nods (like Pete Davidson’s character having to explain to their mom “I’m not a cat”). At a time when we were disconnected from each other, this event brought so many folks  together and showed the power of the people - Dumb Money is a well captured and relatable david and goliath story.|, Having watched all of this unfold live, there has never been a movie I have been more hyped for.|, The cast is soild and the movie looks great. But I think it's still too early to make a movie out of the Gamestop situation, because the actual story hasn't concluded yet.|, Absolutely loved this movie. And I almost understood what they were talking about. 😂 The acting is superb and the script is brilliant. I think I’ll go see it again. Power to the people, people.|, Paul Dano is seriously amazing, his range is unbelievable. This movie looks great it has a solid cast and an interesting story. I can’t wait|, I don't care If it does not reach a good critics level, this has to be a must watch, and including that cast, this projects to be awesome|, Love this! cant wait to see it|, When the game is rigged ..... It still is rigged and this play is not over!

Dumb and Dumber To,Dumb And Dumber To - Official Trailer (HD),dmNddThxi4c,2504062,5749,408,"I absolutely love Dumb and Dumber, to me it's one of the best comedies ever. It's so well written, acted, and the jokes are all done so well that you believe that they are just innocently dumb. In this movie, its just bad in my opinion. At the end, they didn't know what sex was......are you kidding me?|, A flawed sequel but it was great seeing Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels back together again, these two knuckleheads always cracked me up in the original movie and both of them are great dramatic actors as well. 😊|, I'm a Jim Carrey fan from day one, so even though this movie isn't as hilarious as the original, I still liked it. I just hope Jim does better in his future films.|, I liked this movie, it was definitely a “dumb” movie 😂, the fact that Lloyd pranked him for 20 years I think and Harry pranked him back for a kidney but made Lloyd remove his kidney for him, was pretty hilarious, not to mention again, the plot was pretty much like the first first one, basically for nothing, which was disappointing, but was the whole point of the movie.|, i love dumb and dumber and this one is also amazing.you should absolutely give it a try.|, FINALLY! Jim Carey going back to his old roots and what made him! Can't wait|, It’s 2022 and I didn’t even know they made a part 2.
I must have been on some good shit back then|, Hey look, a sequel to a Jim Carrey movie with Jim Carrey in it.|, gotta see it just cause its a classic to my childhood|, Ainda faltam 12 anos pra lançarem o terceiro filme 😭"
Dumbo,Dumbo Official Trailer,7NiYVoqBt-8,21434713,254904,20323,"Thank you Disney for making my childhood come to life again. This movie will always be my favorite. I can relate so much to dumbo and the pain of having his mother taken away. I was separated from my parents at a young age. I often felt like I was trapped in a cage looking through a whole wishing to be left free. This movie brings me so much joy I can't even put in words. Love you Walt Disney for all the beautiful and amazing things you have brought to my life.


- Thank you from a little kid who grew up wishing for a family.|, 1:29 started and I honestly burst into tears. I don’t care what the critics say... I haven’t seen the movie yet but I firmly believe that I will feel all the feelings when I do.|, Tim Burton didn't let me down.  Wonderful film.  Hit all the right emotional chords.|, There’s something about Tim Burton Disney remakes that really make them stand out compared to the others.  They don’t feel like cash grabs, they actually feel like they’re well executed and a sense of imagination|, Don’t understand why there’s so much dislike for this movie. I saw it today.  It was very different from the 1941 cartoon, but I liked the new spin on it.  The wide range of emotion they gave Dumbo is what pulled your heart strings. At least that’s what it did for me.|, O filme do dumbo é lindo !!! Fala do amor de mãe pra filho e vice versa ...que esta passando na globo hoje .|, Kudos to the special effects team who created Dumbo. They did a fantastic job.|, Já chorei só com o trailer imagina  com o filme. ❤|, The only scene that gets me all choked up is when Dumbos mother reaches her trunk out of the cage and wraps it around her baby Dumbo. That scene even got me in  the original.|, I love this Dumbo movie. It's heartwarming. I cried when Ms.Jumbo was locked in the cage and Dumbo missed her mother so much, just like the original did. Idk why I prefer this than the animated Dumbo. It just... different.. Yeah, and I love it, but the animation one was good actually. It's just only the children's acting that wasn't good entire this movie, but I am okay with that. 

It's sad that most of people hate this movie very much and they said this movie sucks :""("
Dune,Dune: Part Two | Official Trailer 2,_YUzQa_1RCE,22166152,208652,10825,"'Because all my visions lead to horror.' 'Why? Because you lose control?' 'No because I gain it.' Not a quote from the book, but a perfect encapsulation of the entire epic story.|, A 3 and a half hour movie?! I’ll enjoy every second 💜|, Thank God we have Denis Villeneuve making movies. He's an utter gem for the industry. Real movies, real scripts, no nonsense (and you all know what I'm talking about).|, “There is nothing more dangerous than a charismatic leader.” -Frank Herbert

I can feel the darker turn around the corner and I love the feel this trailer gives. I am excited! I know I’ve only read the first three Dune books, but is it foolish to hope the six OG books all get adapted?|, ""A longstanding dream of mine is to adapt Dune, but it’s a long process to get the rights, and I don’t think I will succeed""
-Denis Villeneuve, September 2016 during the ""Arrival"" promotion

And now he's fulfilling his dream in getting a chance to adapt his beloved sci fi story, i'm so proud of him 👍|, I don’t think I’ve ever been so hyped for a movie in a long time.|, “The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it.” One of the most powerful lines in the book. Glad to hear it!|, I just love that shot of Paul saying ""long live the fighters."" Can't wait to see this thing.|, I love where this is going. Power and revenge. Paul is living in a very harsh environment and having his whole house destroyed in front of him has hardened him and given him a taste for getting back what was taken from him. I’m very stoked to see part II. Looks like it will be amazing!|, The look of pure religious zeal and fervor in Stilgar's face at 2:29 is so incredibly well done my jaw dropped. It's in the trailer for less than half a second but I don't think I've ever seen an actor portray such an intense and complicated emotion w just their face in half a second. Javier Bardem is otherworldly, pun intended"

Watch Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves on digital NOW: https://paramnt.us/HonorAmongThieves 🐉⚔|, This looks like the director dmed a campaign for the main cast and turned it into a script, which is the vibe I want from. A dnd movie|, Just got back from the theater. Was expecting nothing special and was surprised to find an actually solid and enjoyable movie. Funny and emotional at times. Great stuff!|, This has ""Guardians of the Galaxy goes medieval fantasy"" written all over it, and I'm down for that.|, I was blown away by how accurate to DnD this movie was. It feels like a love letter to DnD made by people who play DnD. I was expecting the usual watered down ""made for general audiences"" MCU style film and instead we got what was essentially a DnD campaign in movie form. Everything from the locations, to the spells, to the monsters, to the magic items all perfectly represented DnD. The film also utilizes show-dont-tell in a way that most Hollywood movies struggle with due to their need for as general of an audience as possible. Nobody needs to explain the bag of holding, or what a displacer beast is, or how breaking concentration affects certain spells, unless the explanation itself is relevant to the plot. Even when they do explain things, it never feels clunky or out of place.|, I hope someone says ""that's like a 1 in 20 chance of happening"" when something lucky happens. That'll be fucking awesome|, Watched it last night at the early release, was definitely a fun night! The movie doesn’t take itself too seriously, that’s the best part|, This is genuinely good D&D energy.
The DM is trying his hardest to tell a serious story but the players are having none of that.|, For the real D&D experience, the druid says ""Can I turn into an Owlbear, PLEASE!?!?"" and the dm goes ""Oh, alright, fine.""|, The conversation between the bard and the druid is ripped straight from a D&D session, and has convinced me to see this movie"

It's an experience.|, Y'all came here for Harry but I came here for Tommy fookin Shelby|, God bless all the souls lost in ww2.
Let's just hope there won't ever be another war of that magnitude.|, This film was absolutely brutal to watch.  Every time you get little glimmers of hope for the main characters, you just end up being swallowed by crushing despair due to the situations they later find themselves in.

10/10 would definitely recommend|, Honestly I don't care who stars in it, I can't wait for this movie. It will be amazing no doubt, in  Nolan we trust.|, 50 % are here for harry styles
30 % are here for cillian murphy 
20 % are here for the actual plot|, Simplesmente demais|, Extremely raw and realistic picture of a war which makes you feel you are there. Without unnecessary drama and individual heroism.

Dutch,Easy Dutch 1 - Basic Phrases from the streets,sgiDZvYZyMQ,2430583,28448,2691,"thank you guys :) I wish I would have more focus and time to cooperate with you on this. I will have an Easy Dutch Translation group on Facebook and then I will invite you there so you could help us before it's too late. |, Dutch is like the love child of English and German|, I've been studying Dutch since so long and I can understand naturally all of these expressions, they sound very familiar to me. This shows that I'm doing well with my studies! 🇳🇱😄|, I completed a 45-day streak of learning Dutch on Duolingo, and I found this video very motivating. I'll study further to understand all the expressions used here.|, As a native English speaker with some, albeit limited, German and an interest in old English and the Scandinavian languages, Nederlands has always fascinated me. It seems that either I get the gist of what people are saying to me, or feel like I really should have. I genuinely enjoy the way it sounds.
At first, it's the guttural consonants that draw your attention, but those are pretty easy and can even sort of serve as a marker in a word or sentence to keep you from losing your way. What I find difficult to reproduce are the vowel sounds. Some of them seem to hover tantalizingly just out of reach...langzamer alstublieft spreken|, Dutch is so straightforward. I had no struggles understanding what they were saying. Believe it or not I’ve never learnt this language at all. I’m a native English speaker and I did some German for a couple of weeks. I look forward to learning Dutch when ready|, Dutch sounds like if a German person got really really drunk and tried speaking English to someone|, I spent 1.5 weeks in Amsterdam, using public transportation, before the end of my trip I swear I was basically able to read it, and understand 1/3rd of what the locals were saying 😂.  Dutch has to be the closest language to Americans/English speakers.  Also by the end of my trip.  
  Another weed thing about it was I was so adjusted to hearing Dutch and other foreign languages that when I heard a couple who were Americans from NY staying at my hostel speaking in American accents I looked at them confused, it took me about 10 seconds to figure out they were actually speaking “American” English.  It sounded super weird, yes most people in Europe speak English but not hearing an American accent for awhile sounds super foreign and strange.|, As an English speaker, natively, Dutch, as written, seems like a mixture of English and German. Therefore, much of the vocabulary if you pay attention is quite similar.|, 1:43 Are we going to ignore the fact that this man needs help and we do nothing?"

It's part of their success and storytelling|, I'm a bit sad that they are doing computer animated,  it lacks the warm cozy feeling of the usual ghibli films. But its a different director so he deserves a chance.  I'll still watch it|, I was a little worried because as an artist I’ve always loved ghiblis relaxing style of 2D animation, but upon hearing that they plan to continue making movies in both styles I am excited to see how their 3d style progresses in future. I bought the DVD and am waiting to have time to watch it but the trailer looks pretty good so far :)|, Ghibli is known for their beautiful animation, I feel like this just drops the ball|, While the animation isn't perfect, I'm not surprised judging by the fact that it's the studio's first venture into the third dimension, and I'm sure I'll still be able to appreciate the movie overall, it still looks really cool. Being a 3D animator myself, I actually think seeing Studio Ghibli try out another art medium is really cool.|, Loved this movie, at first the animation didn’t feel right but then realised that it really does suit this movie and it is Studio Ghibli’s first CGI movie, they’ll get better at it!|, imagine this movie being in the normal studio ghibli animation style, than is would be amaaaazing :'(((((|, You can just tell that this would look amazing in traditional 2D animation|, Relax. Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement again-again 
and is working on his ""true"" final film as we speak.😭💙 It will be in his traditional 2D.
THIS is directed by his son Goro, who has always been experimental, compared to his father's work.

It's not a problem. Why shouldn't they be allowed to at least try the 3D format once? They're allowed.🏆|, Honestly I’m really hyped for this! The animation still looks great even though it’s cgi, I love the character design as well!"

Truly, Eddie is the only thing I remember about the 1988 Olympics and his story. Took my family to the show today, hoping Eddie leaves a mark on their lives as he did with mine and many others from Canada and the world. Cheers Eddie, great story for all👍🏻|, I love this movie. It’s an amazing story. Got me teary eyed a few times. 
The soundtrack is awesome too!|, I'm not a massive Hugh Jackman fan; but that moment of him/Bronson Peary doing the jump in the night, sublimely accompanied by Thin Lizzy's The Cowboy Song, is just magnificent.  It surpasses even the rawest Wolverine scenes in it's sheer masculine vigor.  Definitely one of my favourite movie moments. 
Ah, and yes, the rest of the movie is well worth a watch, too.|, Love how supportive the mom is.|, at the end of the movie, his mom says "" Where do you think you've been, young man? "". Then Eddie says ""Competing in the Olympics, mum"" 
i honestly cried :') and it's really inspiring to watch :') 
love the movie <3|, I couldn't love this movie any more if I tried!  There's nothing better than a good underdog movie with heart and this movie--and Eddie himself--give you something good to root for.  Loved all of the themes and symbolism, too.|, They even got the color of the suit just right, except you missed the little eagle on the shoulder if I recall correctly.:) Eddie gave that suit to my Dad since they were the same size, I stomped around in it as a kid, even wore it with all his medals hanging around my neck as a costume. What a tremendous man and great person, we all loved his sense of humor and humbleness, and daring love of the sport. To all who shared his story and help keep jumping alive.....Keep flying Eddie...... Best, a Chivers kid.|, This is one of my favorite sports movies of all time. So inspiring and fun.|, Not many trailers that send shivers down my spine but this is one of them|, It's funny, I don't remember who won a medal in ski jumping in Olympics.

I still remember, back when it had released people weren't ready to accompany me to the theatre and how I had to watch it all alone. There were hardly 4-5 people in there. They still don't know what they ended up missing.

Eighth Grade,Eighth Grade | Official Trailer HD | A24,y8lFgF_IjPw,8028843,86188,8575,"This movie was amazing and painful to sit through at the same time, finally a film about being a teenager going through puberty that feels relatable! I'm in my late 20s but this movie managed to capture this awkward time around 13/14 perfectly, which most teen movies don't accomplish. The plot is nothing crazy which makes it even more realistic. It's really easy to sympathize with Kayla, as almost everyone goes through what she does, more or less! It catapulted me back in time and brought back memories of my own struggles and feelings, when I was that age.|, as someone who grew up with crippling social anxiety, this movie made me feel so much less alone. it's so accurate to having anxiety and/or being socially awkward in general. i love this movie so much. bo burnham is an artist.|, Don't let the trailer confuse you, this movie is far from cringey and actually hits home on the aspects of today's generation.|, As someone who has been an 8th grade girl this movie was viscerally uncomfortable in places. It was so accurate to some of the feelings and experiences I had at that age that it was almost painful to watch. The authenticity is incredible.|, I'm stunned!  A movie about 8th graders where the actors actually look like 8th graders instead of 30 years old.|, I cried like a little girl in the last scene with her father, it is what every girl with social phobia wants to hear from her father, I still remember it and it moves me, beautiful movie|, Thank God. A coming of age film that actually uses actors who are the proper ages and looks like the director actually has used social media before and understands how actual teenagers interact. This looks great.|, Turns 5!

Let's face it, at one point or another we've all felt awkward or out of place 
Elsie Fisher as Kayla is the one who can relate to so many youths in the audience 
Much like Kayla we grew up in school not knowing what to expect
We talk nervously, say the wrong things, try to be like everyone else to be cool or noticed etc.
It's the worst thing we go through feeling alone, nervous or anti-social
She's about to graduate from eighth grade in middle school and wants badly to make as much of an impact to many of her classmates
Kayla even has an internet blog sharing her feelings and opinions on what it's like for someone like her to swim through difficult waters
At one point she even worries she'll disappoint her father
Director Bo Burnham offers a perceptive look at adolescence; all the highs, lows, the strangeness, the surprises
Young adulthood is also what Burnham himself went through heavily and you can clearly see what transcends to the screen
It's really all about the anxiety we carry as we get older but unaware of how to act around our peers
Confidence and self-esteem aren't the easiest things to face but they are things we can overcome
You can't be brave without being scared, we can see past embarrassment and only focus what's in front of us, being yourself is the best you can be, growing up happens and there's no stopping the good or bad parts involved 
It's good too this also holds a lot of power for adults even for those who've left school behind them
For a film like this it's so refreshing to have the needs and wants of young girls represented in a relatable manner given that teens now are so immersed in social media getting likes and shares, there's almost no frame in this whole thing where someone isn't looking at their phone
Plus with Elsie Fisher it remains very authentic given she's an actual 13 year old not all glamoured up and presented as flawed
At times the movie lags in spots but we're allowed to spend time with this girl knowing she's stressing about moving up in the world
Not strictly for teens but welcome for grown ups to to have deep, meaningful discussions about the subject|, Honestly, this is the movie every middle schooler needs. This is so realistic, teens aren't being played by twenty year olds, they are imperfect and awkward and I love Kayla so much and I love Bo Burnham so much and wow|, Honestly the kid sniffing the highlighter was such a mood tho"

A talented actress and singer.|, She's so honest and real and that's honestly one of her best traits!!! I'm so excited for her new album!!!!|, I loved these questions that you asked Dove as it was so nice to hear different questions and her honest responses! Dove is such a talented actress and singer - love her!|, Her personally is so magnetic that I instantly feel happier hearing her talk and watching her laugh 💗|, I love that she never forgot about Cameron and I mean obviously she wouldn’t, they worked together, they were best friends, but it’s just so sweet to see her bring him up|, her honesty is another reason to admire her more|, Dove cameron and powerpuff??? I NEED IT!!!! Dove cameron is absolutely stunning its so amazing to see how much she has grown up throughout the years!!|, Ive always seen her as someone who seems sensitive but tries to present herself as someone with a tough exterior. The rbf thing though...hun, me too. My husband was asking me recently if i was ok and i told him i just have a bad case of rbf.|, Dove Cameron is iconic! ❤|, I literally love Dove so much. She is such a fun person and i shall indeed give her a hug if i see her in public"
Elvis,Elvis,O-NlByW28HM,0,1320,196,"I’m a 90’s kid and grew up with an uncle who sang to Elvis Presley. He definitely had me falling in love with blues and rock. What a time to be alive and see him perform live. The showmanship he gave every performance. Long live the king 👑|, Best movie of the year! Austin Butler is so gifted that he really became Elvis! The African Americans that influenced Elvis'  choice of music and style was so eye-opening. I learned so much about Elvis as a person and his Manager too.|, 45 years after his death he’s still gaining new fans, this movie completely changed my misconceptions about him and is such a great movie as well! I was 2 when he died and never liked him or gave him the time of day…my mother was a super fan so maybe that’s where my distain comes from but now I’m totally in and obsessed lol way to go Elvis…rockin me from the grave in my 40’s!!|, I was only 5 when Elvis died, and still remember that summer morning. The radio played only Elvis all day, even it was in Canada. What a legend...|, The start of this trailer touches my very soul. The tears filled my eyes as I saw this trailer for the first time. I grew up listening to Elvis Presley. As a adult I can relate to and appreciate his music. Especially when you lose someone you LOVE.|, I grew up listening to Elvis. I was introduced to him by my parents at an early age. I had all of his records, I watched all of his movies and I watched him do the live satellite show in Hawaii on the TV. I remember where I was and what I was doing when it was announced that he died. The whole world mourned Elvis’ death and I believe that we all secretly hoped that he did indeed fake his death and went on to live a life where he could go outside for a walk, to watch the sun set…all by himself. Thank you for giving us all joy in our lives, Elvis, because, sadly, in order for us to have the joy that you gave to us all, you had to take away from yourself and sacrifice your own freedom to do so. God bless Elvis Presley. 🙏❤️🙏|, Amazing and soo sad that such a talent ended this way :( forever missed Elvis 💙|, The most impactful movie I’ve seen to date. Austin brought something truly special to this role that I don’t believe anyone else could. Truly amazing. You can see the dedication put into this film from everyone involved, absolutely incredible. Deserves everything it can get and more.|, I absolutely adore  Elvis Presley...I have been a fan since I was a little  and it was way before my time... so for people who've never really watched him or heard of him this is great ...as far as the movie's concerned.  it's like one big never ending trailer to a movie.. it's great the way it's made but it doesn't really hit home to me... so much they could have done much better job but it's a new age of directing and producing movies like I said it's like watching a never ending trailer to a movie that you yet still have to watch ...it's really hard to explain It ...still worth a watch but they could have done so much better anyways to the new fans out there enjoy and go Watch his movies watch his videos to his songs and you will be blown away at watching the real thing , trust me...|, BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!! WATCHED 5 TIMES ON THEATRES, NO REGRETS!! SUCH A MASTER PIECE!"
Elvis & Nixon,"Elvis &amp; Nixon Official Trailer #1 (2016) - Michael Shannon, Kevin Spacey Movie HD",o9x3Z6b0Z1g,1920465,8559,1462,"39 years after his death and Elvis is still entertaining us. The King is Back!|, I loved it - I remember many things mentioned - doesn't bother me that the actor didn't really look like Elvis - he played it his way and I think it was great.  I'd love to see a sequel, there are tons of Elvis stories - music was great, very funny and very insightful in lots of places.  They took some true events and made a story around it, we don't know if it's factual but who cares - it was a diamond of a movie.  Elvis was such a classic, I love how he was portrayed in the movie.  He was such an interesting person. I heard he made many donations and helped lots of people. My older brother and sister and mother talked about Elvis like he was a relative in another state, they adored him. I played Elvis' religious songs for my mother at her funeral.  :)|, Words cannot even describe how amazing this trailer is to me.|, Holy crap. Why'd they pick someone who looks NOTHING like Elvis?|, This looks absolutely incredible, just shot to one of my most anticipated of 2016.|, This must be the new Elvis movie everyone is talking about!|, I was really surprised how good Michael Shannon did as Elvis even though he didn’t look like him he had his portrayal his personality down packed in my opinion|, love this movie!!!!!   and the history behind this!|, A big Michael Shannon fan.
He was great in Boardwalk Empire.
His 'E' looks pretty damn cool to me.
And of course Spacey is always good.|, This movie rules. It'd oddly touching and is very emotional in spots especially when Elvis is talking to ""Nixon"" before he meets him about his ""twin brother"". Scenes like that will go over people's heads but I foun d it very refreshing."
Elysium,ELYSIUM - Official Trailer (HD),oIBtePb-dGY,12261340,41979,6848,"I really appreciated this movie.. It indirectly shows what is happening in our world- the widening gap between the rich and poor, medication and protection only for the wealthy, how the poor have to struggle to find even a mediocre job.. The action scenes were awesome (that rail gun was exquisite).. The ending was heart-warming.. Above all, I especially liked Kruger's funny dialogues... I give it 9/10.|, Something that I'm loving from Blompkamp's movies is that they contain some crazy overpowered futuristic guns. Portable surface-to-space missiles, chemrail gun, ARC Guns... They all look like videogame weapons and some may even be considered far fetched but turns out they're pure awesomeness once you see them in action.

I hope this trend continues with his next film (known as ""Chappie"" for now and inspired by his short film titled ""Tetra Vaal""), if the story allows for this kind of things.|, galera, o filme é sensacional!! há mto tempo não saia do cinema tão feliz de ver um filme tão bom. nota 10!! já virou um dos meus filmes favoritos!|, Insanely underrated sci-fi action. One of the best in 21 century|, I still think of this movie all the time after nearly a decade later... I feel more and more every day like we are heading towards this as a reality. It was cool seeing another version of this elite's only city in Alita Battle Angel as Zalem.|, *Fantastic movie.* A grim look into the possibilities of what humanity could become if we continue to be ruled by sick, power hungry 'leaders.' Great use of film techniques and the interrelation between various scenes to create an emotional impact was very well done. *This film drew me right in. 8.5/10* |, This is what I loved about District 9 as well. All the action sequences were in daylight. And CGI was fantastic. This is going down the same path. Stoked.|, I know there are a lot of people saying it was bad, but I loved it. And I'm one of those people who is super picky about every little detail about anything. If you like District 9, this is just as awesome.|, Neill Blomkamp is a genius director.. From a Short Film maker and VFX artist to an academy award nomination for his debut movie as a director.. Also he has some unique movie making skills where the VFX and storyline blends effectively to create a masterpiece|, This movie was surprisingly good. I actually enjoyed it more than District 9. The film demonstrates an important aspect of human technological progress, in that it matters a great deal WHO controls our technology base. We have the ability today to produce enough food for everyone to eat, but yet we still have millions in third-world countries who are starving and malnourished. We see absolutely fantastic technologies present in the film, but all this super-tech is controlled and accessed by only a slim and privileged fraction of the human race, namely Elysium. In both the film and our world, the benefit of technology is straddled by the presence of economic culture that diverts wealth and resources to a few and at the expense of others. Elysium has almost miraculous medical technology that can resolve a person of almost any illness or injury, but it is withheld from the majority of the population by the economic elites in Elysium. As in the scene where Frey pleads her doctor colleague for treatment for her terminally-ill daughter, the doctor replies ""This isn't Elysium, we can't just heal her..."" - Access to the life-saving technology is restricted by an X-amount of capital that supposedly represents the arbitrary cost of a human life. We see the same thing with health care in our own society. Is this good or bad? I think it's neither, since one can argue that without economic stipulation attached to the access of technology, there won't be any motivation or incentive to develop the technologies we have in the first place, life-saving or not. At least not with the current prevalent human mindset that revolves around us not willing do something unless there was self-enrichment attached. Watching Elysium continually puts questions in my mind; what are we as a species? Are we simply meant to be creatures of greed and self-indulgence? No matter how advance or expansive the human species becomes, are we doomed to continue such cycle of self-exploitation and stratification? Elysium is not a script-heavy dialogue of meaningful social issues, but instead a base visual landscape that provides a canvas for its audience to extrapolate their own interpretation of the film and its analogical premise. In that respect, I consider it a great film worth watching.     "

Emily the Criminal,Emily The Criminal | Official Trailer | In Theaters August 12,Xzf1YCEkLDI,2510720,6078,470,"What I Love about this, is how even the criminal profit isn’t something extremely luxurious, but just something comfortable. Dude just wants to buy affordable living estates, while she just wants to pay off student loans. It hits a real, down to earth, tune that many just simply ignore as working class problems.|, For those who think that Aubrey only can portrayed awkward characters you need to see her on Black Bear and this one... Stunning.|, Aubrey was brilliant in this role. Each scene it's like doubling down on the previous one getting more and more danger. Thinking this whole thing is over at anytime but has such an amazing complete story. It was suspenseful to say the least.|, Just finished this and loved the movie. It's different and raw and a film that is so direct it's so clear and easy to watch. Glad theo rossi is getting more big screen time hes a great actor|, Just got to see a screening of this at a SAG-AFTRA event and I have to say it is brilliant. So well edited considering it's  brief run time, spectacularly acted. The director leaves you VERY tense from beginning to end, feeling like you are going to get caught like she must have felt. Highly recommended.|, This was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The acting, the plotline, the twists, the whole thing was solid. Bear in mind this is coming from someone that dislikes almost every movie out there and is very picky. But Emily The Criminal was solid.|, Loved this movie! Its message is true af!|, I've seen Aubrey do comedy brilliantly but when I saw the darkness in her watching Ingrid Goes West I knew she was extraordinary. She also fantastic in Black Bear. I love when she does dark roles.|, As a college grad struggling to find steady, sustaining work with considerable student debt, this movie connects with me.  I love dark movies that speak to issues that society overlooks.|, This trailer gave me goosebumps practically throughout the whole thing! I love Aubrey Plaza. I'm going to add this to my must-watch list."
Emma.,are you mad at me?,8dgN0RqrIW0,3169774,186888,8700,"how can we be mad at you?! i’m so happy you took this break.|, I adore how private and intimate this is. It's so nice to watch Emma enjoying a good time with her friends.|, Emma's vlogs aren't your typical vlogs anymore. It is a piece of art.|, I love emma so much. She reminds me to stay alive and really live without even trying. Like just being a human being. She's like a sunday afternoon.|, Emma has really mastered the art of melancholy. There are so many moments in this video that remind me of several scenes from The Graduate - the face fall, the blank stare, the listless sigh. Like Nichols & Hoffman, Emma knows how to capture and almost romanticize those pockets of numbness and ennui we all experience. It's how - even as we watch her move around her multi-million dollar home - we still relate to her.|, its kind of bittersweet. Because I know were all so proud of how far she's come, like she went from teen YouTuber to celebrity fashion icon; not only while staying true to herself but by transitioning to that status with such grace. I miss the vlogs and the collabs but im also so freaking proud of her. she's been doing so much lately, she deserves the break.|, i love how intimate yet so private this is. seeing emma having fun and out with her friends is so refreshing|, seeing the way your cats love you is the best sign to tell you’re a good person|, I just love how Emma is really a reflection of us that we don’t show to the world lol|, Emma needs to direct a movie, she would do a great job with the opportunity to use her creative mindset"
Empire of Light,EMPIRE OF LIGHT | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures,3JA3bD5xs-Q,2750252,4053,357,"An absolutely beautiful film on so many levels. It made me laugh, cry and feel a full spectrum of emotions in between! It took me on a journey back in time to the 80s and left me feeling nostalgic and uplifted. Sam Mendes is an incredible filmmaker!|, Finally a good trailer I could watch all the way through without getting a story completely spoiled for me which honestly is a rarity as I'm sure alot of other people have come to notice recently.
Looks like such a great film, I hope Coleman wins an award for this one, or at the very least a nomination. Visually stunning feature also. 😍😍|, I saw a preview last night and loved this. Stunning photography, beautiful art decoration, great soundtrack and the performances… simply outstanding. A couple critics at the three film festivals it screened at missed the point. The story follows the people at a subtle but pivotal time in England’s history (1981). I applauded when it ended. Hopefully you will too.|, Ignore the film critics, go and see this wonderful film! It’s about LIFE and the many relationships it involves, going up and down depending on whether we feel in love and loved, sex, race, family and much more… Anyone wondering about the age gap (love story btw Olivia Coleman’s and Micheal Ward’s characters) - you wouldn’t be asking if you were a young man who had a formative relationship with an older woman. Same with the racism theme - Steven explains it in very basic terms to Hilary precisely because she is blind to it, it doesn’t affect her. So many other themes beautifully explored!.. And yes, the way the film looks, sounds, the actors’ work - it’s very obviously a labour of love. Mendes devoted it to his mother but every viewer will be moved. You may well cry but, ultimately, it’s uplifting.|, Any other former (or current) indie cinema employees who were absolutely wrecked by this movie? 

“Look around you. This whole place is for people who want to escape. People who don’t belong anywhere else.” That was exactly how it felt.|, what performance by Olivia isn't a 'career-best' ? But I'm always here for Olivia in melt-down mode, and the cinematography/sets look amazing.|, Absolutely brilliant film  im in my 50s and grew up during the 80s being then in my early teens so i fully understand the vibe of this film and can relate to that 80s style very well. The filming has indeed captured the 80s so well.This is how films should be good plot and meaningful i am so fed up the movies being churned out these days it was very refreshing to see something like this which i thought was a thing of the past now such amazing photography and filming style and top class acting from all.|, It's only the trailer and I already know this film is going to destroy me. And then I'm only gonna ask for more. That long shot of olivia reacting to the door crashing open is genius. Sam Mendes + Roger Deakins + Olivia Colman + Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross + Michael Ward = magic.|, I've watched this movie and I can say Olivia Colman gave justice to this. Such an amazing performance here. I'm sad she got snubbed in Oscars for this role as best performance in a leading actress.|, Watched this today. A wonderful story of so many relationships, really makes you think about life. Olivia is just amazing 🤩"

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiNVoBckLqLk7vXlEdsOi0YbPYhhVBdsk|, I love how everyone is smiling in the family portrait while Bruno looks like he's staring through time and space.|, The world doesn't deserve someone like Mirabel. Idealizing a family and a community that treats you like garbage for no reason is just unrequited love but still a pure showing of love.|, I read the trivia about the Madrigals and it turns out that Pedro and Alma’s triplets represent past, present, and future. Julieta (the oldest child) can heal past wounds, Pepa (the middle child) can affect the present weather, and Bruno (the youngest child) can see future visions.|, I just love it when she sang ""okay, okay, okay, okay"" and when the kids go ""Mirabel... Mirabel..."" endlessly.|, 2:25 the two mini families having their own color palettes is such a nice little touch|, I love how she's like, ""My family's amazing and I'm in my family so,"" almost as if she's trying to assure herself that she IS amazing.|, It's so cool how she is not negative about not having a gift while all her family members has it. If I was her, it'll be my villain origin story.|, I'm sure it's been mentioned before, but the townspeople who threw her the accordion are SHADY; the audience and kids don't know it yet, but THEY know she didn't get a gift, and they still threw her an accordion with huge smiles like, ""Go on, tell them about how the house rejected you"".|, I love that even in this super upbeat and positive song...that unconscious resentment of her older siblings is absolutely there. Referring to Isabella as ""the perfect Golden Child"" (which often occurs in textbook narcissistic parenting cases) and the line ""the beauty and the brawn, can do no wrong..."" so much is implied in that one line."
End of Watch,End Of Watch Official Trailer #1 (2012) Jake Gyllenhaal Movie HD,9mQYxib26FM,1517389,9557,468,"What made this movie so good, was the chemistry between Jake and Michael Pena. Watching this, you would literally think they've been partners for years. Incredible job by all the cast, but especially Jake and Micheal.|, This movie was always somewhat sad to me, but after I became a cop and especially after going some of the stuff I’ve gone through on the streets and watching it again, this movie hit me on another emotional level that I can’t explain. Especially the funeral scene at the end holy crap|, Until you actually work in law enforcement, you will never know how hard this movie hits you in the feels. Whoever wrote this did a phenomenal job.|, This didn’t even feel like a movie. It felt like an experience|, I’ve watched this movie maybe 5 times now and I can still say that it makes me tear up every time. God bless our men and women in law enforcement.|, Man this movie straight up made me cry|, As others have said here, best police movie of all time - visionary. I laughed, I wept, I saw a vision of what it's like to work with a family and save lives.

In these times, what else can you ask for? Fantastic film. Everybody iinvolved should be proud.|, no cop movie will beat this 1 hands down best of all time|, I just watched this for the first time. Great movie. Great acting. Great representation. Ending broke my heart. Thank you to every officer risking your lives everyday. WE APPRECIATE YOU!!|, I just watched this movie again for the second time and the first time was when it came out but I wanted to write for anyone who cares to listen that our officers of the law have one of the hardest job in the states and no matter what the bad ones commit, we have have to appreciate what the good/true ones do for us and for our communities to stay safe! Thank the officers and their families for what they have to endure for our safety and protection! Thank you to the men and women that lace up their boots each and everyday! God bless America 🇺🇸"
End of the Century,End of the Century (official trailer),tAlBU6IzDHM,284527,2305,182,"What a haunting meditation on the lives we could have lived but didn't. This film cast a spell over me, slowly but surely. It almost felt like ""Weekend"" but with an existential twist, and I also appreciated how it trusts the audience to follow along with the surprising directions that it goes in. Barberini and Pujol are superb in the leading roles.|, For the past two and a half years ‘Call me by your Name’ has been my go to film for many reasons - the location, scenery, pure niceness of people, early 1980s vibe. Has ‘End of the Century’ - Fin de Siglo surpassed it? In a way, yes!

This film is beautiful - it’s sensitive with real integrity. The two main characters Ocho (Juan Barberini) and Javi (Ramon Pujol) make this film 100% as it is so easy to be attracted to them along with Mia Maestro. Even though I am truly in love with ‘Call me by your Name’ I was never able to warm 100% to Elio and Oliver and was more attracted to Elio’s parents because of their pure elegance, outward thinking, love of culture and intelligence!

I guess that it is incredibly important to like the people in ‘End of the Century’ as the film really does focus on Ocho and Javi, mostly talking on the balcony in Barcelona. Having Barcelona as my ‘spiritual home’, I was excited to see parts of it in the film - I’d love to have seen more shots of the city in it, but hey!

The dancing scene with the 1982 record ‘Space Age Love Song’ by A Flock of Seagulls has a great vibe to it that you can really feel. Fin de Siglo has introduced me to this tune which never leaves my iPhone - I cycle to the gym listening to it, dance around the house and I guess that it would make a brilliant road trip tune in the hot, sexy summer months :) 

I love the sincerity of the balcony late night chat. It’s real, deep and full of integrity.

Towards the end of the film is heart wrenching but that’s all that i’m saying as no spoilers here from me.

Everything about this film is beautiful and being honest, I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m desperate to see it again and again!

Production values are exemplary - beautiful, punchy, crisp (uncompressed sounding) audio with thought provoking camera shots allowing vibrant picture quality. 



5 STARS. Absolute perfection. Fin de Siglo - FILM OF THE YEAR.|, Saw it last night, it was really good! The story is simple but very interesting and dare I say real? the actors have an undeniable chemistry. Btw, the full living room dance sequence made me so happy!|, This movie pulled my strings in an almost unsettling manner. I had almost given up on the thought that Call Me By Your Name can ever be replaced BUT this did. It scared me. Most of you don't get it though. The two guys never meet each other - it's all in his head. The guy is suffering from loneliness and sees this fine man out on his balcony one day - the rest of it is imagined by him. Even the ""friend"" Sonia, is just a girl who performs on the street NOTHING else. NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. Last scene was real though he sees him in real - ONE LAST TIME.|, An exceptional film which contrasts with the clichés of the usual cinematographic productions on love. It's beautiful, intelligent, moving, and it's not just Argentinian: it's universal. Mister Lucio Castro, we wish you a long artistique life also in Europe !

Un film exceptionnel qui contraste avec les clichés des productions cinématographiques habituelles sur l'amour. C'est beau, intelligent, émouvant, et ce n'est pas seulement argentin: c'est universel. Monsieur Lucio Castro, nous vous souhaitons une longue vie artistique aussi en Europe !|, Nice story, a bit confusing in the middle I was like...did it really happen or just some kind of illusion, but later on it didn't matter any more.  Maybe it's not about perfect logic, it's more about the true feeling at that particular moment. Memory, love, sense of loss... I think a lot of people can find their own pieces of life here and there in this movie. Well done! Personally I really enjoy Spanish homosexual movies, very natural performance and good story line,  like ' the blonde one', ‘The man with the answers' etc.|, This is such a clever film. The film opens with a tourist visiting Barcelona( for the first time) puts 4 cans of beer in the fridge, takes one , goes to the balcony, while drinking it, he sees a passing man. At the end of the film, when the same can of beer from the beginning is consumed, he goes back to the fridge . There are the remaining 3 cans still there. Nothing else in the fridge . We have been observing his fantasies as invented by the director in a haunting film . The whole film has created a visual representation for us the audience , of what flashed through his imagination in a matter of minutes as a result of briefly seeing the attractive man from his balcony. It’s what we all do every day of our lives. We allow our thoughts to wander . Like in a dream that seemed to be real and lasted ages but probably was over in minutes. We have just watched 5 or  so minutes of a man’s life , seen from inside his head.|, Very interesting film!!! Seeing it for the first time was like you're in for a joy ride of storytelling. But I don't think I could watch it again as the magical feeling would be completely different. 9/10|, One of the most remarkable movie. You may notice some of the details that you suppose to be mistake of the scripts, but the ending will explain all of those. And I am sure there is only one ending, one story, no other reality.|, Finally watched it yesterday on DVD.
A gift of a movie. Marvellous!"
Ender's Game,Ender&#39;s Game Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Harrison Ford Movie HD,2SRizeR4MmU,5237776,19114,3491,"Holy crap the no-gravity training room looks even cooler than it did in my mind when reading the books|, I remember when I went to go see this- the movie was spectacular! Very mind-blowing, I just felt like a normal, non-intellectual human being lol. I loved it!!! Harrison Ford definitely killed it, Viola Davis made it great, and Asa Butterfield was just the star of it all. 10/10!  |, I read the entire series (both Bean's saga and Ender's). and I loved it. When I saw that they were making a movie, and that it has some of my favorite actors in it, it was unreal. Especially the end part with Dr. Device, It look so epic.|, This movie was legendary! teaches you things and relates to the world we live in now... I hope they consider part 2!|, This trailer does the movie no justice at all. The movie is absolutely AMAZING!! I watched it with my kids several times and loved it every time!!|, Every time after they win the final battle I get tears in my eyes ,I may be a man and a bit sensible but my mind knows and recognizes the human cruelty ,the way we prefer to think and the fact that this is all a reality in brings an even bitter taste in my mouth ,shatters my soul from within and ironically ends me.|, I just saw this and and was very pleased with the movie. Although some parts were rushed or taken out, overall it was filled with good acting,  excitement and drama|, Lots of people complaining about the variation between book and film, primarily the age differences. In the book, Ender is 6 at Battle School and 10 at Command School. But changing actors mid-way tends to make us not care about the character either way. And in the film Ender (and his crew) to me are probably more in the 12-15 range, which is also probably more acceptable to people, since the idea of a 10 year old tactical mastermind is pretty outlandish to most people. Another big change, they seriously toned down just how violent Ender's response to his bullies actually was, in the novel he actually kills Stilson and Bonzo both.

All in all this is a great film, and while generally I hate changes made in the film adaptations of novels/comics (X-Men being my most hated example), the changes made here are presented in a way that makes them very acceptable. And any film that features Harrison Ford being a badass is bound to be great (although frankly, Ford is always a badass, on AND off film) I definitely recommend this to people looking for a great sci-fi flick.|, At 29 I come back to this movie every so often and enjoy it every time. I'd sit through hours of this if it had been a series. I am interested in reading the books now|, This movie makes me feel special. An underrated master piece, just the way I like it."
Endless Love,ENDLESS LOVE,WhRwltVQXyU,701829,12615,1797,"This film is full of emotion and teaches the power of true love. It shows that some men will always love their partners, no matter what challenges they face. This film reminds us that it is important to believe in, have patience for, and encourage our partners. Men do a lot for their families, and they are the foundation that holds us all up. May God bless every genuine man who goes out every day to provide for and take care of his family.
Bro Frederick Leonard is a fantastic actor who brings passion to his roles. For a few minutes, I was so caught up in the story that I thought the events were real. Frederick Leonard's performance was so convincing that I was completely immersed in the film. I also want to commend Aunty Peggy's performance. She acted flawlessly and brought so much emotion to her role. Overall, this film is everything a movie should be. It's emotional, thought-provoking, and inspiring. I highly recommend it.
Uncle Fredrick is sooo Good,Gush i want to like this movie a million times.|, When you have matured casts on your set all you do is enjoy them do their craft and say yes they are the best.

Enough Said,ENOUGH SAID: Official HD Trailer,R09EnVNGnio,1072600,1299,98,"A very believable, relatable love story.   James steals every scene in this film alone, and it still remains one of my absolute favorites.   Heartwarming, poignant, beautiful and actually quite romantic.|, I could watch this movie every day multiple times a day. Loved how both main characters acted. So believable and heart warming.|, The movie is 10 years old!
I remember seeing it at the manlius art cinema 

Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini in one of his last roles
Director Nicole Holofcener tells an adult romantic-comedy showing the sobering depiction of being middle-aged

This movie succeeds being approachable with its treatment of mid-life crisis with humor and tenderness 
It helps this will resonate with many adult viewers
Eva's character deals with the crossroads of reaching this point in her life while also facing the reality of her daughter packing up and leaving for college 
It’s both Eva and Albert's character that are past their prime forced to overcome their own cynical views
Parents don’t have to lose touch with their inner selves raising a child, duplicity is what can cause a rift in a relationship, cynicism can tear its ugly head, the dark side of mid life crisis is the bitterness and viewing life and people around you through pettiness, facing your middle years is another facet of life
The two leads have never been better in this kind of dramedy even of this script is very shallow
Some of the line readings are awkward and stilted plus it feels restrained considering the age jokes present
Still Holofcener makes the appeal of Dreyfus and Gandolfini sparkle looking at dating in real life as the years pass
Even the ending I was getting a bit teary eyed|, This film is tremendous. Both Gandolfini and Dreyfus are incredibly good playing normal people/characters. Dreyfus in particular shows a lot of depth to her talent here in the subtlest of ways (when here daughter leaves for college scene). She should have been nominated for an Oscar.|, I just happened to see the trailer for this on another disc last week, and bought this disc on the strength of the trailer . What a film! One of the, if not the, most heartwarming romance I've seen. A phenomenal film, a simple story beautifully told, and superbly acted. I coudm watch it again right away. If you haven't seen it, do so. Should be far better known than it seems to be.|, How have I never seen this? I found it at just  the right time in my life. Two of my favorite actors in such a beautiful movie. I’m sure I’ll see this more than a few more times. They both stole my heart. ❤️|, This is such a wonderful film, and maybe James Gandolfini's best and most poignant performance.  It's so sad that he never lived to see it released.  RIP.|, This is one of my favourite films. I've lost count of how many times I've seen it ❤️|, Its so sad that James is gone, may RIP. This is the perfect role for him. He is timid, but honest and yet he is so likable as a gentle giant who really found pleasure in the little tnhings in life. He never breakes out of his comfort zone and yet he is so gentle, and kind, he lauds his ex-wife because he can find the beauty in the right stuff in her, he is just so charming and genuine, you can't nit like him, even for his beautiful soul. This is so well played by James in his sublime behavior. He still fosters a sense of love in his daughter when she may be breaking down his flaws but being the actor that James was, he comes across as an innocent man torn by his divorce and his need to find someone else to fill the emotional void he confronts on a day-to-day basis, liking his wife and daughter, despite their myriad of flaws and personal flaws gentle and innocent nature in his love life and his work. To have that ability to escape into movies, to find some solice in his job and in his work, is so lovely portrayed in James acting ability. James you are gone, but to find peace in the valley, as Johnny Cash would say, you did your job beautifully and you are a legend in the Sopronos and much more. You are a unqie gentleman and amazing actor, father and husband, you will always be idolized for your acting abitilty and kind nature. You should be here in sunshine or in shadow, oh Jimmy boy, UI love you so>|, James was a great actor. Could fit many different roles. Taken too soon god rest his soul"

Couldn’t stop laughing and glad I binged it but sad it’s over. Honestly never related so much with TV show’s character as E and turtle.

I just felt very bad to watch people suffer and die.|, Remember watching this on theater. And when the movie ends and people were about to leave, they locked the doors and flashed on screen ""ESCAPE ROOM"". We freaked out 😂 lol|, I remember when it came out, people were hating on it so much so I didn't watch it. 
A week ago, I saw it and it was bloody great in my opinion. I recommend it if you like these types of movies.|, This movie was surprisingly good! I don't usually care for modern movies since films these days are cliche or have crappy plots. But this one was actually GREAT. The effects were excellent, the characters actually grew on me, the story was nicely handled and actually original, and I am DEFINITELY going to spend some money to see the sequel (if the storytelling hasn't wavered that is). I seriously hope the next movie is good just this like was! And I'll admit... 

I ship Ben and Zoey! Hoping they don't die in Escape Room 2! Otherwise, I will be seriously bummed out.|, This movie was phenomenal. I really hope they make a sequel (especially since it left on such a cliffhanger)|, This was way better than I expected from yet another escape room movie. I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Definitely worth watching.|, Just watched it.  And yes it's a good movie.  Good actors and the ending was good. I'll wait for the part 2 👌|, This was by far the best Escape room movie to date. Perfectly executed, great visuals and sound effects that will have you grasping tight to your couch. 9/10.

Extremely fun film and well-written.|, I put this on half heartedly last night, not really expecting much but lacking anything better that I hadn't seen before.  I really enjoyed it.

I personally loved it. I think that is was some of Josh Hutchersons best work. His acting was amazing this movie deserves more praise than it got.|, I watched this at home on bluray last night. Absolutely brilliant. Not perfect but far out, the last hour is just gut wrenching tension. Del Toro is creepy ask and Hutcherson is brilliant in the tense panic moments.|, I really love  how the story evolves and the situations lived by the main character. It is not the story of Pablo Escobar once again, it would be the story of someone's Life shattered because of Escobar|, This was a great movie. 
Very well done, it’s a fictional tale about a real character. 
I would say watch it and see every scene. A true masterpiece and it shows how a man is loved by so many but in reality, he’s a monster.|, Although I don't like it when people only associate Colombia with cocaine I really am excited for this film. Escobar's story is an amazing one to tell. His reign was such a dark time for Colombia; but the people of the country have risen little by little trying to make Colombia a better place and giving it a better name.|, Muero por ir al cine a verla por fin... la mansion donde fue filmada esta peli queda a unos metros detras de mi casa y me alegrara ver a mis vecinos y amigos haciendo papel de extras en esta peli, lastima que por el trabajo no pude participar... buen trailer gracias por subirlo :D|, Very underrated movie. Del Toro's performance was beyond brilliant.|, These are the best trailers. Trailer like this one givs you the story so you know what you're getting yourself into, but it doesn't tell you so much that you feel like you already watched the movie. It leaves a bit of mystery for you to uncover.|, This looks like its going to be good! Great to see Josh branching out too.|, Yay! Josh Hutchersons Manager and Agent are finally getting him good gigs! This looks severely interesting and also shows another side of Josh Hutcherson's versatility that I was questionable about. His most recent movie with Mocking Jay: Part 1 was a big step towards what he is capable of but I think he could do so much more. This trailer makes me think this could be the movie he does it with. Congrats. Can't wait to see it <3"

The feeling of terror when The Celestial appears after that. I love it|, Eternals is interesting but could've been absolutely stellar as a TV show. The potential for storytelling across human history and finishing it with a movie that serves as a series finale. What could've been...|, I finally watched this movie on Disney+, and I gotta say It’s not a great movie but it’s not terrible either. The movie is very slow paced especially for an MCU film and the fights often felt anti-climactic, but it definitely has unique elements and feels like one of the more unique MCU films.|, For me, 
This movie isn't bad at all. for the storyline 7/10, but the cinematography 10000/10.|, I don’t know why this movie is hated by others. I really enjoyed it. I think it has the best cinematography out of any marvel movie. Has the best use of imax scenes.|, Still impressed by the Celestials. They made them so terrifying and made you respect them. I want Eternals 2!|, Music by Ramin Djawadi!!!! 
Cannot wait to hear the legend's soundtrack for Eternals!|, Eternals is not that bad as the critics suggests. It's a pretty good depiction of Marvel's cosmic universe. It's like an origin story of the MCU itself. Liked the way they Integrated the story to human civilizations.|, This movie has such mixed reviews that are all over the place. I actually love this movie. People say it's stupid slow, I love the pacing that gives everything more breathing room than just being another rumpedy pumpedy action movie made for short attention spans. I felt the acting, writing, music, cinematography was all such a genuine feeling. Visual effects and cinematography were ridiculously good. VFX were insanely consistent as well throughout the entire film which does not happen all the time. Usually they only save the highest quality work and renders for the most cinematic or action packed scenes.|, Great movie"

Very touching, informative, emotional, a must see|, I am intersex, with AIS. I was born with no uterus or ovaries, no cervix and one kidney. I have one internal teste. When I first found out I was 18 (21 years ago) and the terms intersex and AIS were not taught to me. I didn’t even learn about my XY chromosomes until 3 years ago (age 36) when I took a 23 and Me test and a scientist emailed me to ask if I knew. It was so affirming though and really helped me accept myself in a whole new way. The world needs this documentary. I want to be more apart of this work. I live in the PNW and would love to help this movement somehow; to help teach people more about us! ❤|, i totally bawled when they showed the david reimer interview|, This film is PROFOUND. Groundbreaking. Saw it last night at Cinemark in Ann Arbor. It piqued my interest when I saw the movie trailer on MSNBC. Besides myself, there were only four other young women in the entire screening room, one of whom was one of the producers who helped to fund this extraordinary documentary. I wish I could purchase copies of the DVD and gift it to certain members and friends. As a nation, as a world, we need to know what this film presents. The true stars of this film are the three brave individuals who, articulately and empathetically, bared their souls to tell their own heart breaking stories in order to to help those who couldn't, or can't. Articulate and empathetic, these three indivuals speak with complete candor in regards to what happened to them and what they endured. The storytelling and cinematography is FIRST RATE. This film is QUALITY and should absolutely be considered for major awards. NETFLIX: This film should be on your radar. Help to inform and educate, show this to the world. Straight forward, relevant. Enquiring minds need to know. Especially those who DON'T enquire or who ignorantly pass judgments without even attempting to educate themselves to understand LGBTQIA individuals. People like Tucker Carlson and Ron DeSantis (to name only two, but the list is endless) who say publically polarizing things in the media, which causes a litany of problems and fallout. If these people can't read or rock a book, how about sitting for an hour and a half to watch this excellent, straight forward,  film?  This nation, this world, NEEDS to know these things. We need to know in order to stop these things from continuing. It might impart some things we desperately need and keen for in this country: Greater Understanding and Compassion for all God's Beings.|, finally.  :)|, Just saw it this afternoon and it was LIFE CHANGING. I hope everyone goes. I learned so much, cried so much, it was wonderful.|, All of my education about Intersex folks was from the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides. I'm excited to see this and learn directly from real individuals. Hooray for the reality of nature's diversity!|, I can’t wait for this to be out. These stories need to be told and lifted.|, The I in LGBTQIA. I've known some Intersex people, who were unhappy or unsupportive of being part of the community, but they were respectful about it.|, Thank you for this documentary. I am looking forward to seeing the film hold an honest conversation about being intersex with respect, understanding, and compassion."

It really did feel like the sequel to dazed and confused. Makes me want to ring up some friends and hang. Richard Linklater, always captures the essence of interaction in real life American culture. Each character had their own personalities and was believable, it makes you go ""Man I use to know a guy like that"". Yet another masterpiece from Richard Linklater.|, This a movie that you won't know you wanted and needed to watch. It's got great directing, smooth pace and dialogue, it's witty and funny. Great choice of cast, chemistry blends perfectly between all characters over the space of 3 days. It's not your typical boy makes mistake, get's in trouble for it with other guys or girl movie. This makes it even more enjoyable and entertaining the whole way through considering there isn't a step by step narrative, it's just fulfilling to watch, makes you feel good and makes you want more. I wouldn't go to imdb with this one, the reviews are overly pretentious and harsh.|, If you are a Dazed and Confused fan, rest assured this movie is AMAZING.|, I️ loved this movie I️ didn’t want it to end|, One of the funniest films of recent times, enjoyed this one a lot! Something very heartfelt and authentic about their acting, and the movie as a whole, it's not your typical film about a bunch of college dudes. Refreshing!|, Terrific movie.  Brings back memories of my childhood.  Completely puts the viewer in the summer of 1980, perfectly, from the music to the clothing, everything.|, I CANNOT WAIT!! I am an 80's kid & from those who have seen it & who are also ""Dazed & Confused"" fans like me, it's the older brother to it! Richard Linklater always knows how to make a great movie! So blessed to be an 80's kid....life was cooler & easier & not as scary as today!|, really great film, one of those what makes you want to be there having the time of your life with the guys. I think the dude who played finn stole the show, great character.|, One of the best movies of the year IMO and would like to see it win an Oscar for the screenplay"

This film will win every award that's landed on it.|, What I loved about this movie is either you don’t get it, or it hits. And when it hits, it HITS.|, I'm ashamed that I waited so long to watch this film. What a beautiful, poignant, funny, emotional movie this is.  Everything from the story, the themes, the writing, the acting, and the editing makes this movie a masterpiece of cinema. Michelle Yeoh puts on a tour-de-force performance for the ages and she deserves every award she won. The same goes for the movie. I've seen iconic movies from Citizen Kane, Vertigo, The Godfather, Goodfellas, Forrest Gump, and The Shawshank Redemption, Back to the Future and this movie should be held in the same regard as those classics. It's absolutely incredible and is quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made.|, Across all the universes, we live in the one where this movie makes history as the most-awarded film of all time. I sobbed a lot watching the Oscars last night. I'm going to rewatch it and bring back all the feelings this movie has brought me. Just revolutionary!|, This film has it all. Outstanding performances. Excellent direction as well as writing. I loved how the visual effects are employed to complement the plot rather than being the main focus of the film. It is both emotionally charged and action-packed. It delivers a powerful message while retaining a plausible story. It was perplexing as well as interesting, and it left me wanting more.|, I have no idea what's going on and it looks amazing.|, This movie changed my whole perspective on my life and my family. This is beyond incredible. Brings me to tears everytime. Thank you for this movie.|, This movie makes you cry and then burst out in laughter 2 seconds later, felt like putting a large spoonful of sugar, chilli powder, and lemon juice in my mouth and chewing it at the same time|, The fact they use multiverse in a regular movie like this to make it entertaining is a brilliant idea. We always see the multiverse in DC and Marvel shows but for once they use it to make a regular movie into a masterpiece.|, The fact that this covers the concepts of  at least 11 dimensions in a time frame of a non-epic (in length) movie after I tried to learn and grasp my mind around them is so mind boggling and impressive. Kudos to everyone who worked on this."

Evil Dead,Evil Dead (2013) - Official Trailer (HD),vTGHA33Xyh4,1878608,12867,391,"The thing that i truly love about this movie is the fact that we have your sterotypical horror characters but instead of simply killing them, they tore them to pieces. When you cheer on the demons in a film like evil dead, youve done youre job.|, One of the best horror remakes ever.|, This movie was absolutely terrifying chills from start to finish can't wait to see evil dead rise 🙌|, I remember watching this in theatres and it was a full house.  Everyone was screaming and laughing and just having a good time!|, This is what a good remake should be. Using the same plot, but with just enough changes in the story, characters, effects, and ending to make it it's own thing.

I'm not saying it's better than the original trilogy, but it's enough to be a talking point of the franchise.|, One of the greatest horror franchises ever. Truly a Masterpiece.|, I remember seeing this film  for the first time when it was just released at the cinema with a friend when I was 16 years old . I almost peed on the seat, especially in the final scene. The special effects like the background music are very elaborate. This is really spooky!|, The movie is officially 10 years old!!!

This has some of the best gore I've seen in a long time 
Mainly during the climax is the best stuff because the action is kicked into high gear with an impressive score by Roque Banos with the filmmakers adding small nods to the original like the chainsaw, the infamous tree scene etc.
Not downright scary but it did make me jump a few times which is rare for a horror movie 
I found it funny they tried to add some emotional depth to this whole thing 
But the strengthened personal-trauma angle is a warm welcome for this Mia character while also trying to convince her friends she hasn't lost her mind due to withdrawal, after all the book is causing much more anxiety 
Jane Levy is the best thing in the movie becoming a final girl earning such scream queen status giving more of an edge having a wide range
Plus you are not loathing the characters waiting for them to die; their relationships aren't deep buy serviceable 
There's even a hilarious cameo after the credits that knocked my socks off!
This remake is way more visceral and intense plus less comedic than Raimi's version thanks to practical effects of severed heads, tongues, limbs 
Luckily too this paved the way for the franchise to become part of the mainstream horror
So it has enough to stand on its own acting as a continuation of Raimi's universe but also provide plenty of subtle hints to the original film|, Love this movie to death ❤|, Love this film. And this is coming from a guy who's favorite horror film is the original."

This looks absolutely wild and feels like it’s going to give the 2013 remake a run for its money…which is crazy because it was already REALLY good.|, What I love about the Evil Dead movies is once the horror starts, it does not end. It just escalates more and more.|, After just seeing this movie in theaters I can confidently say this has to be by far the best horror movie I've ever come across, It genuinely made my girl feel like she was about to have a panic attack. 10/10|, Saw it in theaters last night and it was the first Evil Dead movie I've ever watched. It was absolutely incredible and was such a great movie-going experience. The cinematography, the dialogue, and the chilling music, were all done beautifully. Highly recommend! Looking forward to another one.|, This movie was a masterpiece to me very creepy and I loved the atmosphere and the scarier tone it had. Also, the stakes was high for our kid characters very brutal and did not let up and so intense. The change of environment to was utilized to its fullest very claustrophobic and anxiety inducing and all the blood in the third act was gnarly I’m not sure how people don’t like this movie it’s evil dead baby!|, This is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a really really long time. Amazing cast, amazing special effects and very well written.|, The mother phrase at the door, the way she says it, her expression.. and also what the child says in her simplicity... GENIUS!!!
horror filmmakers should learn!|, This is probably one of the best horror films I've ever seen. That's saying alot. It's also hands down the most gory that's for sure. Intense from start to finish. Alyssa Sutherland (the mom) was phenomonal. She is what really set this one apart from the rest. 10/10|, Saw it last night and WHOAH! It truly terrified the living hell out of me and my boyfriend. It’s definitely the scariest Evil Dead film since the original. The scares just kept getting more and more intense, and the film upheld such a diabolical and ungodly tone. Alyssa Sutherland played a sick evil deadite so perfectly. The entire cast did an excellent job. I’m a huge horror buff and it frightened even me. Go see it guys! 🧟‍♂️🖤|, The actress who played the mom was just brilliant. I was genuinely creeped out at 29 years old😂. I even had to pause the scenes to brace myself cause how frightening some parts were. I’ll be watching the original series. I saw the 2013 remake which was pretty awesome too"
Ex Machina,"Ex Machina Official Teaser Trailer #1 (2015) - Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson Movie HD",EoQuVnKhxaM,9164863,28829,2843,"this movie was interesting and exciting.|, I'm actually genuinely impressed by this trailer. The opening quote sets the tone and theme of the movie impeccably. What intrigues me more is how not only is Domhall Gleeson's character finding it more difficult to differentiate whether Ava is machine or human, but how Ava in turn flips it over and makes him doubt whether he himself is human. This is such a fundamental effect of robots being indistinguishable from humans on our psyche that I'm surprised I have never really seen it on screen before. People would be driven hysterical. God would become irrelevant. Purpose is extinguished. I think this really could potentially mean the movie shifts from a Sci Fi premise into a psychological thriller. Damn, I'm intrigued.|, It's movies like these that are phenomenal to watch, love how they actually made me ask questions to myself regarding human life. Goodmovie!|, I love the lonely setting of the film and the acting was great. The music fits super well into the movie and the ending is shocking and very well made. I honestly love this movie and the aesthetic it creates. Most horror films focus on bloody slashers and kills but I love that this movie goes in a different direction. 10/10 film!|, honestly one of the best movies I've ever watched in my entire life -- kudos to the writers, actors, producers, and just the AMAZING cinematographers who just did a fabulous job with the graphics & animations|, Absolutely fantastic movie. The ending was so unpredicted. Everyone forgets that Ava was an AI, and not human - she was programmed to find a way to escape, through the means of deceiving humans, into thinking she cared for him. This meant She wasn't able to save Caleb, because that is not what she was programmed for. It took me a while to process it, but i gradually got a better understanding to why she did what she did. With that being said, it still confuses me to why she thought she told Nathan to ""stay there"", meaning she did Intend to lock him up - she would have escaped anyways.  Obviously Caleb didn't anticipate that she would do what she did, but with his brains, i think he should have listened to Nathan, when he was saying she was only using  him to escape, then that wouldn't have happened. Oh well, that's what love does to you; even though it was a Robot - A sexy one though hahaha|, For people who haven't seen the movie, this trailer gives absolutely nothing away and if you think you know where its going, you don't. |, One of the best sci-fi films I've seen in a long time. A lot better than I thought it would be.|, The way Ava says ""what will happen to me if I fail your test"" really makes me shiver all over. I seriously cannot wait to see this movie.|, Ahhh by far the most unique and amazing film of 2015. Incredible storytelling, acting and overall pacing of the film. One of those movies that leaves you thinking for an hour after in ends."
Exodus: Gods and Kings,Exodus: Gods and Kings | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,t-8YsulfxVI,15708476,44153,10023,"This was a spectacle. I enjoyed the scale, and the sense of grandness. I love the way Ridley Scott makes things so much more complex and Dark than they need to be. The only thing missing was a massive battle in the parted sea. The trailer tricked me on that one, but the movie was still very impressive.|, I absolutely LOVE this movie!!!!  I have likely watched it 100 times. It never gets old.|, Ridley Scott never fails :) I don't look at this as a religious movie and there is too much controversy over wrong issues. Although the story is still vague and mysterious to archeologists and historians it is a great material for a movie. The portrayal of characters and brotherly love that turns into a deadly duel is staggering in this story.
Moses got a more humane touch here. Most people imagine him as a ruthless avenger and a barbaric brute. The Ramses character is of the greatest interest to me. He seems quite sane and likeable as an unexperienced young leader only to lose his mind and turn into a dictator when he loses his grasp over the empire. In many ways this movie is a masterpiece.|, Great movie. Ridley Scott's movies are always cinematic epics. A lot of people have criticized this movie about its biblical inaccuracies, but you don't get your history from movies. I think Christian Bale's depiction of Moses was much more accurate to the Bible than Charlton Heston's version, but that is just my take on it.|, Wow, so much hate on this movie. I absolutely loved it and was completely blown away by it. The acting was incredible. Fantastic flick!|, I LOVE this movie and watch it as often as possible. I wish It would return to theatres in 3D someday soon....|, Im actually really excited to see this film. Regardless whether I have faith or not I think there is no denying this is going to be a spectacle to see and visually stunning. It looks epic and I cannot wait to eventually see it :-)|, I wanted to see this movie for a very long time. I watched it for the first time recently. I will say these things about the movie and leave it at that, nothing more.
I loved the costume designs and digital effects of the movie. The relationship between Moses and Rameses. It felt like brothers at war with one another. Awesome job. And I was impressed with the entire cast. They all did good in this film.
The battle scenes and plagues are awesome to watch and how they displayed Egypt back in the ancient times. The Red Sea wave was epic to me. I wish they would have spared the horses, I am a horse person so just being protective. 
Here comes the things I did not like about it.
It was not biblical like I thought it would be and wanted it to be. I was taken back by God being in the form of a child when speaking to Moses rather than how it is in the Bible and the film, Prince of Egypt. 
Other than that, a good film to watch.|, Nothing can beat the movie The Ten Commandments.  Yul Brynner as Ramses was incredible.  |, This movie is the most underrated movie ooh all time.  It's labeled 100 times better than the original. It's more realistic and so much more entrancing. This is a remarkable movie that I actually own it."

There's always going to be action stars past their prime to do these movies.|, Expendables are the type of movie that i can just relax with. Just sit down, not too much thinking, just action and humor.|, Each film in the franchise is packed with intense action, memorable one-liners, and the kind of explosive entertainment that keeps audiences coming back for more.|, I see a good old-fashioned action movie count me in!|, The Expendables is such a great franchise. Nobody is expecting anything Oscar worthy or groundbreaking. Just a bunch of likable, recognizable faces kicking ass and cracking jokes.|, These old school type of action films hold a special place in my heart, cos there’ll be a time when they don’t exist anymore. Newer “action” films try to be too deep and poetic, the expendables franchise is just good ol’ ass-kicking and badassery, and that’s all it needs to be.|, I feel like I’ve just been transported back to the 80s AND I LOVE IT|, Love that Stallone keeping his movies alive with his friends man. That's how you do it. Love all these guys.|, It is Jason’s altogether decent and likeable character that makes him such a hit! And it’s his fighting martial arts skills that make him special too!😊"

We wanted a triology about newt training his animals and maybe fighting grindewald, except in the 3rd movie we barley got screentime of newt|, That Harry Potter Theme Song! So excited, this looks really good!|, Just got back from seeing the movie, and I've already developed a theory. 
     So, the movie is based in early 1926, the same year Tom Riddle was born. Now, the entire series' timeline is going to stretch 19 years (1926-1945), just about as old as Tom Riddle was when he came to power. So, if my mind is being coherent, that means the last one or two movies could span throughout Tom's years at Hogwarts and showcase his rise to power. If that doesn't make you excited and craving more, then you need to sort out your priorities. 
     PEOPLE, WE COULD POTENTIALLY BE GETTING A MOVIE ABOUT TOM RIDDLE'S EARLY YEARS. HOW 'FANTASTIC' IS THAT??|, I think that a movie about the founders of Hogwarts would be pretty cool. We'd get to see the tension between Salazar and Godric and also how the houses were formed and maybe shed some light on Rowena and Helga too|, I found this movie exciting and creative.

Not just because from being close they ended up enemies but their ideologies as well. Grindelwald wanted the wizards to rule over muggles just how magneto wanted the mutants to rule. And dumbledore and Charles being the characters that didn't want to spare lives and tried to stop (grindelwald and magneto). It's just so similar.|, Just watched it, I really liked it. As much as I love Johnny and I hate that they removed him from the series, I personally think Mads fits Grindelwald much better, he's good at playing sinister sociopathic villains, much like his role as Hannibal, there's a certain sick feeling I get when watching it, that I didn't necessarily get when Johnny played Grindelwald. Mads really made me hate his character but love him as an actor for that exact reason.|, Johnny Depp 's grindelwald is like a villain from a superhero movie , while Mads Mikkelsen 's is more realistic/human in my opinion ,  both amazing but in different styles .|, I love that at the end of the film they mention traditional Polish dishes like pierogi I goloabki - so sweet :D|, I truly marvel at JK Rowling's incredible use of metaphors.
It would appear that she has a firm grasp on how politics shapes  our perceptions.
But I'm amazed at how well she has implanted defenses within her stories - these small glimpses into things made to appear complicated, break -down the ambiguities.
She has provided an excellent defense against the forces seeking to overturn the old, in favor of a consolidation of power.
Perhaps the future will one day realize what she has done- nonetheless, she has provided the template -
The beauty of this template is that is that it REQUIRES NO MAGIC.|, Kinda refreshing to see Dumbledore handing out points to a house not named Gryffindor for once.|, Of the actors that could have been chosen to replace Johnny Depp 
as Grindelwald, I think they've made the best ever choice in my opinion. Mads Mikkelson is a phenomenal actor, the number one choice.|, Es lomento de ver la saga completa nuevamente, muy buena película|, Una película que cuando la vez quieres una segunda parte 🤩"

Fantasy Island,FANTASY ISLAND - Official Trailer (HD),a6O30nJ02PU,19956692,111356,5274,"It’s not exactly scary but enough horribly ugly faces and violence to get you through along with some life lessons, I even shed a tear at the end. Definitely worth watching !|, Literally nobody is mentioning the fact that this is based off of a TV show that is about as far away from horror as it gets|, why does 7 rings actually fit so well|, Um filme bem construtivo com uma fotografia excelente, é um filme que não contém um terror macabro, e sim um terror psicólogico entre os personagens, o filme tem um enredo bom e uma história com reviravolta, é um filme bem trabalhado em cenário e no enredo aonde o telespectador se apega no desenrolar do filme, e aonde vai fazendo todo o sentido do porque do real motivo dos personagens irem parar na ilha.
O filme contém algumas cenas que de certo modo, os personagens são meio idiotas e tipo as coisas acontecem só por acontecer como fosse algo mal projetado, é como se o filme tivesse que continuar, mas os produtores não tiveram ideia de fazer a cena, como exemplo o personagem tem que morrer, mas como fazer isso, há vamos deixar o personagem que tem noventa e nove por cento de chance de viver, ficar esperando uma bala disparada de um revólver atingi-lo, esse é só um exemplo e não necessariamente que isso tenha acontecido no filme, mas como no exemplo tem cenas assim, então o filme ficou devendo nessa parte, e esse foi um ponto muito negativo para o filme, outro ponto negativo, foi as atuações que também ficaram devendo e já por conta das cenas mau projetadas, do mais o filme é bom.|, I’m really glad Lucy Hale is doing more horror films. Pretty Little Liars originally had slasher elements to it, and she’s done Fear Island, Scream 4, Truth or Dare, and now this. She’s becoming a new modern Scream Queen.|, Finally got around to watching this ...not the fantasy island you remember but loved how it explored the islands power and energy ...  had lots of great twists and turns and the ending will make any fantasy island fan smile and do a fist pump at the end ... enjoyed it|, I don’t know why there’s so many people saying the movie was bad, I saw it yesterday and I was fascinated, which doesn’t happen often when I watch horror movies. The concept was really well executed and the plot twists were more than unpredictable. Also a movie that doesn’t only rely on jump scares to make you feel emotions. Very good movie in my opinion?|, This movie is actually very interesting, unpredictable plot and quite creative.  Yes, it has few flaws as every movie, but that's fiction after all.|, I feel like this makes more sense than most people expected especially with the original show, after all isnt it sketchy how someone runs an island where every fantasy comes true no matter how strange or impossible? And I gotta give credit to whatever madlad came up with the story for the movie especially since it’s based on an old family sitcom|, I remember, I rented this and watched it with my little sister.. We both thought it was the worst movie we've ever seen. 😂 After the movie ended we both laughed our asses off, so it wasn't actually that bad of a experience. 😄"
Far from the Madding Crowd,Far from the Madding Crowd Official Trailer #2 (2015) - Carey Mulligan Movie HD,5-_9AFwMDmQ,3111304,14554,791,"this is such an incredible film I've seen it twice now and am just totally in love with Gabriel.  It's just so sweet how loyal he remains throughout.  The bit with the sheep at the start was just so sad, I've since gotten the 1998 version, but Matthias is lovely.|, Great book! I recall with nostalgia how that I read and used the literature during my A level schooldays in 1982 along with another title 'Tess of the Durbervilles'. It's good to know it has been adapted into a movie. Kudos to the producer and the actors. This will surely further preserve Thomas Hardy's literary legacy.|, This is a beautifull movie. I watched it on the airplain going back to Brazil and after less than 1 hour of the movie I was already crying! It's lovely.|, “It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in a language which is chiefly made by men to express theirs.”|, Very much looking forward to Carey's return to playing the lead role in a film. She has really only done it 3 times,  in ""An Education"" and ""Never Let Me Go"" and as Sally Sparrow in ""Blink"" episode of Doctor Who and she was awesome in all 3.|, I can tell most people leaving comments haven't read the book.  The story is a lot darker, deep, and more complex than simply 3 guys fighting over a girl, and her having to choose.  I don't think anyone who goes to see this will be bored.  I personally can't wait!|, I think this is the most beautiful trailer I've ever watched. And that soundtrack...🧡I just love the movie and the book!🎬💓|, Absolutely perfect. Once , of course,  you know that there is a book with the depth of the story in it and that this is the cinematographic representation of it.|, I believe this movie will be an instant classic. Carey Mulligan is one of the best new actresses. She reminds me of Audrey Hepburn.|, Mulligan is an exceedingly talented actress, but the best work she's ever done (and perhaps will ever do) was in An Education. The look on her face as she sits on the stairs at the end of that movie was, by itself, worthy of her oscar nomination."

Nicely synced to the music.|, ""I roll till I drop and ride till I die"". True lyrics indeed.

R.I.P Paul Walker, may you light up the skies just as well as you lit up the streets with your phenomenal driving skills. X|, I remember when the first one came out and I didn't really want to see it but my cousins talked me into it…i went back to the movies two more times after that to see it again. I was 16 then and now I'm 28. A lot of us grew up with this franchise so Paul's passing, for me anyway, feels like losing a friend. I feel so bad for his family and his ""fast family"". R.I.P. Paul Walker.|, Still a better love story than Twilight... |, i saw this movie in theaters it is honestly worth the money it was so much better than the last one in my opinion it is the best one yet.It was just great.I wanna see it again|, Fast and the Furious 6 is one of my favourite movies this year.R.I.P. Paul Walker you died a true hero fighting for those less fortunate than yourself, God is so lucky to have such a loving, caring and humble guy with him in heaven. You've finally reached the big one.Put the pedal to the medal and made God proud my brother."

Wish there will be 10 installments in the franchise genuinely.

1. Keanu Reeves
2. Don Lee (Ma Dong Seok)
3. John Cena
4. Bruce Willis
5. Jason Momoa|, Legends say Fast&Furious was once about street racing...|, Saw it last night and LOVED it!!!! So much fun! It’s a wild ride, lots of car chases, great action, over the top in so many ways (much like many of the other FF movies), and has a lot of great comedy, especially the banter between Hobbs and Shaw. One final thing I loved about it was it was not political. Looking forward to the sequel.|, I love how the Fast and the furious series just gets more and more pure action in their movies😍|, Deadly movie straight up🔥💯

So beautiful, so magical, so bright! So empowering! So empowered! I adore it x|, Gugu never fails us, we know this is a good movie|, I have to think for second...umm, yeah, I’ve been waiting my entire life for a movie like this. Just little more than 35 years...worth it. I’m here for it!|, I just keep coming back to this movie bc being the only mixed child of color in my family helps, and being the youngest. My mom told me she went to a fortune teller lady, she told my mom that someone unexpected was going to come into her life and that was me, but not from her husband. I was born from loneliness and attention, and I ALWAYS knew I was different, seen the world different. My dreams weren't normal, they always told me what was going to happen, I always look and see colors that aren't there, I have a much deeper connection to something unknown. My stepdad showed me to not fear the thunderstorms and rain...it's what made us bond more than my mom, I miss him, but I'm glad he is in a better place now, sometimes I see him in my dreams on the porch, smoking his cigarette.|, You only have 10 days to watch this movie on Netflix if you haven’t seen it is incredible, one of the best movies I have ever seen|, This was really good. The production may not have had the budget it needed for the special effects, but the performances are terrific. They lift this story which makes you care about each character. It's powerful and immediate.|, This movie got no publicity.  I found it intriguing and captivating. Not too long and it holds your attention.  A shame that it flew under the radar.  Hope there’s a part 2.|, Going back to the hive to find safety and re-establish the bonds that provide her the strength she needs to understand her purpose. A great movie for those of use who have forgotten what it takes to realize our purpose.|, I loved this movie for many reasons. The layers within are amazing. The superhero is imperfect and real plus a woman. What is possible is fascinating because of the brokeness we each experience. This will remain in my collection for years to come. What can we effect? Love love love.|, We need more movies like these. It is a fantastic movie and quite frankly, want to show support, a major wave of Blu-Ray, Digital, ans DVD sales would help make it work."

Father Stu,FATHER STU - Official Trailer (HD),DHREzAdyCPs,10538518,71505,4186,"This was not the direction I was expecting for Daddy’s Home 3|, I did not expect to be moved as much. I was trying to hold my tears back, but I could no longer help it during the final 10 or 20 minutes of the movie. This movie deserves more appreciation|, As a pastor's wife, I watched this movie yesterday and cried. Loved it. This Christian life IS not what we see portrayed in every day movies. We don't go around all day smiling, being perfect or smelling like gingerbread. Some of us are rough around the edges, we may not fit in the conventional cliques and may be outcasts like Father Stu - this movie is not for the perfect Christian, but the imperfect, who have a heart and a calling from God. God can use us, regardless of our background or afflictions, he knows the plans he has for us. Yes it has cursing, but so does life, it has imperfect people but so does life. But when I tell you this movie made me wept, it moved me. I loved the ordination scene. I tried telling someone about it today, and I cried. Lord help me to persevere. Help me to be ME and not a copy of what people want me to be, and use ME just the way I am. Thank you  Mr. Wahlberg.|, Mark and Mel both should get Oscar noms for their performance in this film. They were absolutely incredible. Brilliant film. Was on the brink of crying multiple times.|, I am a Muslim who raised up learning to have a fully respect to all humans. No matter you are religious or not. I just finished watching this movie. Can’t express how wonderful this movie was. It Has so many great life lessons and meaningful thoughts to learn from. 
Mark! you deserve an Oscar for this one! Great acting skills and highly appreciated efforts from all the cast to share with us this beautiful story as a movie. 🙏👏🏻|, I absolutely LOVE THIS MOVIE! I just finished watching it and had to jump on YouTube to comment on all the trailers. It was hysterical and had me in tears 😭. Haven’t seen a movie this good in such a long time. Thank God the story was told with rawness, cursing, rated R because any other way would have been fake. Praying for a HUGE success at the box office 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻|, My dad has this condition. Not once seen his type represented before. Muscular Dystrophy, is the condition. There are different types of it, with my dad having the one that develops later on in your life. It's all I have known; he started getting it when I was around 3. 

Thank you, Mark, for bringing attention to this condition. I look forward to seeing the movie.|, I watched this movie last night and it touched my heart. These are the type of movies I like when they are based on true stories and very well portrayed. This made me do some thinking on how loving and forgiving God is. Mark Walberg is definitely an elite actor and I can't wait to see other movies from him. Please keep making movies like these. Mel Gibson and his mom were good in their parts too.Of course everybody loves Mr. Gibson. Mark Walburg should win an Oscar for this!!!|, I just got done watching this movie with my mom and we loved it. It was sooo good and heartfelt, I cried a lot.  My mom and I aren't Catholic but we are believer's,  and of christian faith.   Movies, stories like this matter and often times help reaffirm or help people acknowledge their faith and the love they have for God. Movies, stories like this make you grateful for the faith you do have or even often doubt. It was powerful, and Mark and everyone else involved did a phenomenal job in this.|, I just saw this film last night. I hadn't seen the trailer and literally knew nothing about the storyline. I want to thank God for every person who facilitated the making of this beautiful movie, especially it's central character, Father Stu. So many deep and powerful messages are represented throughout it. If you are a person who knows suffering and longing and desires to know why...see this film! If you think there are no more compelling films being made...see this film! If you go with a broken heart, you will receive answers. Thank you, Mark!"

The best day of my life|, my father once grabbed me by the shoulder with a tear in his eye and said ""son you mean so much to me but I will beat you like Cherokee drum if you slam the fridge again""|, I think people get confused because they can't separate the awesome way Denzel delivered these lines and the horrible context of the words he delivered. A Father should know his Son idolizes him and he shouldn't just like him but love him. My Father clothed and fed me but he also hugged me and told me he loved me. He was my best friend until the day he died. I remember we were playing a Little League baseball championship and my Father said he couldn't make it because he had to work. I was at bat and I saw my Father running to watch the game. I cried like a baby in front of the team and we won the game. I hope Father's know the most manly thing you can do is take care of your family and not just like but love your kids. I understand the story though. The way some men and women are raised makes it hard for them to show emotions to their kids.|, Denzel is great in this scene, no doubt... But the stage performance James Earl jones delivered, gives you the chills.... I'm sure Denzel watched it dozen times to prep|, Troy does make one good point. You can't go through life life worrying about if someone likes you or not because people are too judgmental. You do need to make sure people treat you with respect as long you respect yourself.|, My father once told me, ""You're my son and I love you, I'll always love you. . . . . but I'm not always going to like you."".|, Denzel can be a motivator,a villain and a hero and he still can deliver lines like they have a powerful message behind them|, Ten years later: Why doesn’t my son ever come to visit or call me?"

The books are so well written and beautiful|, When I was younger I thought this movie was simply weird but now that I'm actually of age I actually see the appeal. This is a pretty well written trilogy.|, It sad that people think the first one was bad. If you never read all the books then you won't understand. Fifty shades darker was in my opinion the best book. Not just about sex, all three books are about how messed up he actually is and how much she really wants to heal him. Its pretty sweet. I can't wait for this movie!|, I'm so in love with this series that I'm crying after watching this, my heart is beating insanely fast, and I'm freaking out.|, I feel like this trailer went from romance, to horror, to a Bond film fast|, Oh céus! 😍😍😍😍😍
Esse trailer tá simplesmente fantástico (queria dizer mesmo fooooooooda😍❤).
cheeeeega logo fevereiro!!!!|, I loved the books and the movie.  The actor's portrayal of the characters was spot on.  I'm looking forward to the sequels.  The people who can't look beyond the obvious and see this (movie and books) for the beautiful love story that is, have no empathy,compassion or ability to see see behind the sex.  Which was pretty well done considering the suits wanted an R rating.  It would have been better as an NC17.|, The part where he says that if something were to happen to her and he could never forgive himself sounds exactly like Edward.|, amo muito este filme ....amoooo."

Truly one of the films.|, I love all the characters in 50 Shades of Grey, including Marcia Gay Harden that plays Christian's mum. And I love how Christian exercises his authority to everyone around him but he feels intimidated by his mum. The scene when his mum arrive at his place unannounced and he says ""fuck, it's my mum"" is so cool! He acts like a little boy that was caught doing something naughty. I love it!|, Hands down , best family film to watch 👍🏻👍🏻|, Imagine if a movie theater played this trailer before Frozen... the kids would be scarred for life|, 4 years passed and I'm back here finally legal to watch this film 😂😂|, Despite everything about this series, this trailer is one of the best i've ever watched. So dam good i always come back to it every once in a while to experience it.|, Knowing this started as a fanfiction of twilight and having just recently rewatched twilight, it makes so much sense. ""I can't stay away from you"" is literally what Edward said to Bella. More similarities than i'd thought.|, There's a genre for every movie and to make something like this as a film, you would surely HAVE TO outstep those boundaries, the entertainment industry is hard and no one has or will probably ever see a movie as intense as this. If it were never made, it would be something our society would have surely been afraid to approach. It shows that every love story is different and if every movie were the same and not to be brave enough to explore a different concept then what is the point of romance films? 50 shades of grey has really opened our eyes to real passion."

Amazing representation of Paige! <3|, This was one of the better movies I have seen lately, was completely different than what I assumed based on the trailer, I mean that in a great way. Kudos to the makers. A very positive film!!|, This is the only WWE movie that I'm really looking forward to.|, That girl is perfectly casted as Paige.|, Funny thing is, the Rock went through exactly this! He comes from a wrestling family, his grand father and father was a wrestler, from both sides of his family! When he first came to the wrestling scene he wasn't even accepted, until he reinvented himself as his rock persona. I'm not even surprised he's producing this movie, in some weird way, this is retelling of the Rock's story, minus a few changes and the protagonist is female. But it's pretty cool to see the Rock's journey come full circle, and is quite inspiring."

Final Portrait,Final Portrait | Official Trailer HD (2017),sRsiW5c29Sk,177528,937,49,"love this film -- seeing the impulsiveness of creativity and also the edgy unstable camerawork fits perfectly with the chaotic nature of the artist's process. Oh, and both major actors are wonderful!   I'd love to see more fine films like this on creative artist.  I read it is based on memoir but have to find out whose - James Lord's I guess.|, An incredible movie and yes definitely for the artist who understands what an artist is|, Bought this on dvd at discounted price, and watched it - it’s like I’m watching the two different characters develop in their own way: Rush in his eccentric way of striving for his accomplishment, and Hammer in his trying way to hold his patience and nerve for how long he can sit in for. The two differences bounce off each other perfectly. And I’m normally picky about what I watch.|, James Lord was a great writer with an expansive vocabulary.  He deserves recognition as well, especially since this movie is based on one of his books about Giacometti.|, Great cast, interesting plot. Also, directed by Tucci, who is himself a great actor. I'm sold.|, Wow,  after this movie I started to love the artist Giacometti !  Grateful|, How come so less views.. man its Armie ... how can u not desire to watch him everywhere u can|, i will love to see this movie, I'm a big fan of biographical movies about artist and musicians|, I love this actor from Call me by your Name !|, Armie Hammer 😍😍"

I can’t wait! ❤️🙌|, One of the few movies that deserve 10/10 from me for this year.  a masterpiece from every aspect, a cool story with great humor, emotions, and what a lovely beautiful place, I wish I've born in Ireland.|, Truly amazing movie, I was not at all expecting so much emotions from it. Little advice for those who hesitate: watch it, you won’t regret it!!|, The “story of my life” is the reason I’m gonna watch this movie just because it’s in the trailer|, Great movie!!! Beautiful filming, decent acting and good plot. NO SMUT, unlike Hollywood movies. It has values- like forgiveness.|, The look of the violin playing caught my eye on this. Very well done. As a violinist myself, it's usually painfully fake. I wonder how it was done? Did Rose really learn that much for the role?|, This movie is too good for everyone in the world to watch❤️❤️🤧 totally loved it|, I’m just crying bc “story of my life” is in the background!!!😭🖐🏻|, Absolutely beautiful movie!🥰So glad I came across it.|, It was such a sweet, heartwarming movie."

RichBoyJhae's video coming later today!|, Let's just take a moment to appreciate the perfection of those 501st walkers|, Always blown away by your star wars drip. Effort does not go unnoticed too- love this! (The micro build before the actual base was great too)

Happy to hear your recovery went well <3|, Very nice! Loose leaf on the plant stems always look great, used that technique once and that MOC is still built and on display in my shelves.
Gotta say, you knocked this out of the park especially with what you had to deal with, more power to you my friend! Also relief to see that you're doing good after that unexpected event.|, This came out incredible, especially since you only had half the time to do it! It’s great to see you putting my clone cadets and workout clones to good use in this MOC!|, its great to see such a well thought out and executed collab project in this space, fantastic build too dude!|, Such a great MOC and content.

I haven't seen the other builds yet, but I'm looking forward to see how they all stack up!!|, This feels like such a classic Lego Star Wars moc, loving this build challenge!"

Then in 2018 he took his own life, only a few months before Keith did the same thing. Me and my brother wanted it played at the cremation service but we got overruled (I guess it may not have been to everyone's taste!). Shame as it would have been a great way to honour his sense of humour. At least we got to play it at the wake.|, A perfect example of how can make a clip so stylish without using special effects. Perfection.|, man, this song hits so hard after all these years, and with a different feeling now.  RIP Keith you will be remembered for eternity|, Боги музыки 💪|, I was lucky enough to see  The Prodigy live. It was the most chaotic, intense and bonkers thing I've ever experienced! 🤟🤟🤟|, Without question one of the most iconic songs of the 90s|, 27 years later and this song sounds like it's from this time, even better than many songs from now...this band was on another level for that time|, I'm 32 years old, and these guys are still pumping!!! As I heard them at the age of 13 , I still jump breaking my knees ! Sleep well Keith!|, I still remember the first time I saw this video. I had no clue who these guys were. It was late at night in 1996 and MTV would play heavier music videos late at night. I fell in love with the video and the band after that first viewing. That was 27 years ago and it's still just as cool.|, This song can be 100 years old in the future and still never get boring such a quality song and video."

Me when A24 releases this trailer: Brilliant. Unstoppable. The human condition. My aura cried. Here’s my social security.|, I love how A24 can push out EVERY kind of movie imaginable! From disturbing and fucked-up movies like THE WITCH and MIDSOMMAR, to fast and anxiety-inducing movies like UNCUT GEMS and GOOD TIME,  to slow burn movies like UNDER THE SKIN and THE LIGHTHOUSE, to kickback and heartfelt movies like FIRST COW. Goes to show that they truly do have a versatile eye for artists!|, I LOVE A24. I know they're just a distributor but they've just been so consistent in releasing these great original films|, The ability for A24 to adapt to so many different genres and still produce good films is just mind boggling|, This looks like a live action movie made by Studio Ghibli.|, Kelly Reichardt is my favorite modern director! So happy to see A24 for recognizing her immense talent!|, This is the chillest trailer ever|, Kelly Reichardt finally receiving the recognition she deserves ♡♡ She has made some overlooked and amazing independent films like Old Joy (2006) and Wendy & Lucy (2008) and she cast her real dog (Lucy) in these films.

First Man,First Man - Official Trailer (HD),PSoRx87OO6k,8866360,39915,5604,"Its a shame we live in a world where a movie like this isn't appreciated much. Very few moments in cinema have made my tear up like the liftoff and landing scene in this movie. Its the perfect marriage of visuals and music. Hands down the greatest space movie ever made. Damien chazelle did a beautiful job at showing the scale of it all. 5 years after watching it in imax i recently re-watched on a smaller screen and the impact of this movie is almost the same|, This might be one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I was in tears at some points, because it is TRUE. Neil Armstrong managed to escape death over and over and over, the chance of success was comical. Space exploration will save humanity thousands of years from now, and I believe that is is so challenging that it will require us to unite as a species and pool all our resources. It all started here. Thank you to every Astronaut who risks their lives for that belief|, As an aerospace engineer this gets me right in the feels, Neil is a legend.|, This movie was amazing! Omg what a wonderful, sad and emotionally touching film. Loved it. One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.|, I just saw this movie and it is fantastic. So well done and like nothing I've ever seen before. Beautifully shot with subtle story telling that puts you right back in time.  This movie makes you feel like you are walking in Neil Armstrong's shoes. Absolutely excellent!|, My heart breaks when I read the reviews for this movie on IMDB and other places. A movie about Mr. Neil Armstrong was always going to be hard but this film does him justice. Whilst I do feel very much for the movie patrons who were expecting something other than what this is, yes you would feel duped and I understand that. But in life you should have more than one gear - just sayin. This is closer to 2001 - A Space Odyssey rather than Apollo 13. To be in the shoes of the people surrounded by extremes in both expectation and fallible technology, they overcame insurmountable odds to achieve something that has been dreamt about since we could first look up at the night sky - so basically forever. This is a film of the sacrifices made by the men, women and citizens of a nation who were responsible for getting all of us there. If you cannot or do not think you can be a witness to the majesty that underlies these events then please go and watch something else. FYI - I am not American but am capable of giving credit where it is due. Thanks for reading this far btw.|, This film is absolutely incredible. One of the best films ever made. Do not miss this experience on the big screen!|, Man I wish I could've seen this great film on the IMAX screen back when it came out in theaters, had I known it's such a great film. Great story, score, cinematography, effects... the score especially brings this film to life!|, have seen this movie a dozend times. still having a hard time holding back my tears. a MASTERPIECE|, I felt every piece of this movie, excellent cinematography and sound design. I haven't been soo touched by a movie like this before"
First Reformed,First Reformed | Official Trailer HD | A24,hCF5Y8dQpR4,6401462,16397,1114,"For me, this film had the effect of an electroconvulsive shock. After I left the theatre, I briefly saw the world through a new lens. Everything was much clearer, more vivid and intense, stripped of false pretense, infused with a sense of hope and despair in equal measure. That is the power of cinema and First Reformed unleashes it like a nuclear bomb.|, As a fan of many of Ethan Hawke's performances, I can honestly say without a doubt this is the best performance of his career. Much of the intensity that comes from the film comes from his performance, whether he is eventually going to break. Watched as usual on boxxy software with great dubbing. Don't miss it|, This is a really great movie. It's one of the best films of 2018 in my opinion. The story is engaging, Ethan Hawke's performance is amazing, and it deals with themes that really make you think about the movie days after you've seen it. I give it an 8/10.|, This film is underrated. The cinematography is stunning and Ethan hawke's preformence is amazing. I get it's a smaller budget but the film deserves more credit|, Watched this in a theater by myself and an elderly couple. Thank goodness they sat in the back, for never have I seen a movie in the cinema that leaves me staring blankly at the screen with my mouth agape and tears in my eyes, my mind a whirl. A provoking and startling watch, that has left me deep in thought into the night. Phenomenal. Thank you.|, Snubbed by the oscars. To me it's still the best movie of the year.|, I hope this is the film that brings the recognition Ethan Hawke deserves, truly one of the most under appreciated actors working today.|, incredible movie. i love A24. every movie they’ve put out is amazing|, Watched this for the first time last night and it was one of the most haunting films I’ve seen in a long time. It has stuck with me well past its ending.|, One of the very best American films of the 2010s, but I'm not sure I could stomach watching it at this moment in time. It doesn't just prod the soul; it impales it."
Fist Fight,Fist Fight - Official Trailer [HD],9aIzXYo6VCE,5027406,17788,741,"I can't believe they didn't put his daughter singing at the talent show that's like the best part|, Just watched this movie. It was not only full of colorful cursing, but funny as hell. Every bit of this ""feel-good"" movie was hysterical. There is one part where I couldn't stop laughing because of the audacity of it. Probably the best comedy that I will have seen for a long time coming. I give it 10/10.|, I remember when I was in high school and on my last senior day I started a food fight at the cafeteria. Now I work in McDonald's|, Charlie has really come full circle. From an illiterate janitor at a school to an english teacher at a high school!|, ""you're a grown man, now go on and take that ass whoopin"", some funny shit|, Finally after many years an old school comedy which is just there to entertain. And the entertainment is great.|, Kinda sad how we don’t see movies like this, at least not in theaters anymore. If it was released today it would definitely be dumped on a streaming service.|, I don't know why but this looks amazing.. such an epic trailer for the stupidest concept film ever. I can't wait!|, This is going to be a freaking hilarious movie, I can tell. Does anyone else just really love Charlie Day?|, Never in my life did I ever think I would see Luigi and Craig in a movie together."

U r willing to give them everything even when u don't have anything ♥️|, This was honestly one of the best romantic movies I have watched. The emotions were so real, and I can't even begin to describe how hurting my heart was at the end. Holy Christmas, I cried a lot|, you do not know how much I cried during this film not joking :(|, 2:09 the way he looks at her is *everything*|, I'm 17 years old and I never had someone who can hug me in that way.

I don’t care what the haters and critics say, even though it was gorey and scary enough, even if it wasn’t accurate to the lore, I felt like a kid again watching this and it was one of the best theater experiences I ever had|, Seen it today and it was better than I expected! I loved the whole back story for Mike and how it leads up to the ending. You can tell they’re setting up more than one movie. 8/10|, I love the plot. It’s gripping and it fits very well the original story. However, the story isn’t the same. All the characters are different and their personalities too. My favorite is the night guard, because he’s sharp and he cares a lot about his little sister. The soundtrack is the best thing of the whole trailer, I find it really original. The special effects are incredible. By the way, I love the animatronics. They seem so fluffy and adorable, but they could eat you if they wanted to, and in the worst of the ways.|, I just finished the movie and it was actually pretty fun and I LOVED the set design, visuals, animatronics and the atmosphere!! 
Also Josh Hutcherson’a acting is incredible!|, I watched the movie last Friday I honestly didn't expect it to be so good the plot twists were definitely crazy and entertaining I loved it|, This looks really interesting! Here's hoping the movie will be just as good as the games! 😃|, Just watched the movie. This movie was amazing, just how i anticipated. My childhood is finished. Thank you, Scott, for everything.|, I just saw this movie with my brother and it was awesome. A lot of people were freaking out at certain parts and the animatronics were really cool. I wasn't expecting that plot twist near the end and I really hope that this movie has a sequel.|, É emocionante como o enredo se encaixa na história orinal. Todos os personagens são diferentes e suas personalidades também."

Great movie.|, James Norton deserves more exposure in Hollywood. He's been hitting it out of the park in plenty of UK drama shows like Happy Valley, Grantchester, War & Peace etc.|, This is a pretty
good movie, I did not think it was bad at all. I have not seen the

thought it was pretty good. The concept of the story is cool I like

Godbless her cute, pure and passionate soul! rest in peace Madame Florence Foster Jenkins <3|, “Everyone said she couldn’t sing, but thay can never say she didn’t” ❤️❤️❤️|, This is so incredible. Thanks for posting. FFJ was not just a bad singer--she was a whole encyclopedia of wildly bad singing--a prodigy of bad taste and ineptitude--and her singing is so hilarious you can listen to it over and over and still be captivated and amazed. Most bad singing is merely sad and dull, but she made you feel like you were watching a fireworks show; it's dazzling in its badness.|, Before there was Tommy Wiseau, and before there was Ed Wood, and before there was Tiny Tim, there was Florence Foster Jenkins. She was truly ahead of her time.|, She had so much courage, not just in her performing, but living with the deadly disease she did most of her life.|, What is really sad is that her tone deafness was a result of  the syphilis which she contracted on her wedding night from her husband. ..
“The disease apparently affected her hearing, giving her tinnitus. Some reports even say that was what prevented her from singing in tune.”
In her younger years she was a promising student in music.|, In the end, I don't think it matters that she was a terrible singer, because one way or another she put on a great show and everyone left with a smile on their face! 

And isn't that what everyone wants ultimately, to be entertained?  I can't imagine anyone ever got bored during her performances! She was a great entertainer."

Not guns and heists and dogs and Vin Diesel. 😂|, I almost broke out in tears at the last scene. I can feel Shelby's emotions and grief. Love this movie. ❤|, Enzo Ferrari's ability to piss off big names into making crazy cars is his greatest legacy.|, Bale is - quite simply - the finest actor of his generation.|, RIP Ken Miles (November 1, 1918 – August 17, 1966), aged 47
And
RIP Carroll Shelby (January 11, 1923 – May 10, 2012), aged 89
You both will be remembered as legends.|, Words cannot describe how beautifully shot the cars are when racing. It's a perfect combination of lighting, angles, colors, composition and the wonderfully rounded shape of the cars.|, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, a duo we never knew we needed.|, Took me 3 years to finally watch this movie and oh man, this is a masterpiece. Not many good movies recently. But this one is hands down great. Has some great messages too. Loved it.|, The fact that Ford considers winning against Ferrari at Le Mans as its greatest achievement of all time really speaks volumes about the greatness of Ferrari. Ford had limitless resources and money and still needed the help from the British to have a chance against a small privately owned Italian car company without any outside help. Americans tell this story as if Ford was some tiny company that went against the GIANT Ferrari, when in reality it was exactly the other way around. Let's also not forget the fact that Ferrari got revenge on Ford in Ford's own backyard at the Daytona 24h in 1967 by finishing 1-2-3.|, Bloody hell that was a great movie."

Loved every minute of it!!!|, Much like nachos out of the microwave, this film is quick, simple, and a little too cheesy, but also enjoyable and without regrets. It made me think about my family relationships and what I'm doing to strengthen them. It also painted small town Louisiana in a very beautiful picture and that was nice to see.|, So happy for Jessica(the lead actress)! First saw her in La La Land and knew she had something special, then she did Happy Death Day and all the critics praised her, even when they didn't like the movie itself and now, she's doing more films.. So happy!|, Vou assistir só por causa da atriz que fez ""A morte te dá parabéns""ela é maravilhosa ❤️|, The plot is good. I really loved the movie. Highly recommended.

Four Good Days,"FOUR GOOD DAYS Trailer (2021) Mila Kunis, Glenn Close Drama Movie",Tb42RG3T1uk,4935774,52536,4152,"I am her story. So many of us are her story. We can live. We can make it through it.|, It was amazing going to the theater to see this last night. Our entire recovery group went and just took the place over. Heck we even made the people that didn't come with us a part of our group, cause that's just what we do. Everyone was crying and laughing ( even when it was probably inappropriate to do so) but we all lived it. 
 For me tho, man..... I brought my mom with me and it was just....something else. Hard to explain. We both did, and went thru the same things these main characters went thru, so much pain I caused and she endured...but there we were...together...happy... Three years sober this month and I STILL feel guilty for the things I put her thru.. but this movie helped heal us even more. I wish I could thank everyone who made this movie personally.|, As a child watching their mother have to go through this their whole life, this hits home hard. We lost our family and everything due to addiction. I hope this raises awareness of addiction instead of looking the other way.|, This hits home for my family.  Having two siblings in active addiction,  the heartbreak, waiting for the call at any second they are gone.  I think more people can relate to this, within their families, than most imagine.  Addiction doesn't discriminate,  it doesn't care if you're rich or poor, educated or not, old or young.  So many can look down and judge, that's the sad part. We are all human, addiction can happen to any of us. Those quick to turn their nose up, maybe just see from a different perspective,  talk about it, ask questions, be there for someone. It's hard as hell to not be so angry at someone you love for being an addict. I know because I feel it every day. I  still love them, it's a back and forth battle to know how to help, how to be there in a positive way,  yet not be an enabler. The hardest thing is loving them from a distance to protect my child.  All four of us grew up with addict parents, being raised  around it makes it easy to go down the same path. Everyone is different,  we handle trauma differently.  I didn't escape the abuse and drug filled life unscathed,  I just got lucky that I never wanted to do those things. It could easily have been me on drugs, or in an abusive relationship.  It can be hard to go down a better path, when your childhood was so immersed in that atmosphere.  Hard, but not impossible.  I have my own issues,  I'm no better than anyone, and I don't judge. We're all human, trying to find our way in this world,  trying to get over our hurt from the past.  
As the oldest sibling, I wish I could save my baby (grown yet still my baby siblings in my eyes)  brother and sister. I'd do anything,  however I realize,  and accept it has to be their choice to change. It still doesn't hurt any less watching those you love with all your heart & soul, slowly kill themselves. ❤❤❤|, I am currently in heart failure after my 20th overdose, I’m 24 years old. This shit made me tear up.. But I have 70 days today and I pray for everyone else that’s struggling with this too. I got love for y’all 💙

October 28th I will have 9 MONTHS CLEAN !!!!! I just want to express my gratitude for all of you guys and your support !! Honestly it means so much to me to read these comments and primarily see positivity from people who care… I love it. You guys make me smile more than you know 💙|, this movie is literally me. From opiate addiction to my mother trying to help me but failing, to relapses, and finally having the strength to break free of my addiction.|, Someone give glen close her oscar already whilst she is still alive to accept it in person.|, I cried watching this trailer. I couldn’t help it. It reminded me of me and what I went through with my parents. I was an opiate addict and I had such a good life before it. Then I hit rock bottom and moved back in with my parents when I was 25 and they watched me like a hawk. They said I could follow their rules and let them help me or I could leave and go do whatever I wanted but that I was on my own. I chose to stay with them. I couldn’t go anywhere by myself. I could go grocery shopping with my mom. Anytime I was on the phone or texting someone they would ask who it was. They did everything they could to help me and I know how much it killed them inside to see me like that. Well what they did worked and I’m 4 years clean now.|, The part where the mom said she didn't *want* to love her anymore: that really is how you feel loving someone with an addiction. The cycles of hope and betrayal, over and over again. It will break you. You just can't get through to them. You feel like their warden. You have to watch them all the time. And the minute you feel like it's safe to let your guard down, they give in and clobber you.|, Mila Kunis’ method acting is PHENOMENAL. she doesn’t even look like an actor, it looks like the real thing. so impressive."

The recording studio actually collapsed, killing the voice actor, but Vince Gilligan kept recording! This movie was truly ahead of it‘s time|, What makes the ""angry birds"" scene even better is that those native americans didn’t show up anywhere in the entire movie before this scene. These guys literally materialized into existence just to deliver a joke.|, One year ago today, Schaffrillas talked about the movie where they go back in time to the first Thanksgiving to get turkeys off the menu. That's right, one year ago today, Schaffrillas talked about the movie where they go back in time to the first Thanksgiving to get turkeys off the menu.|, 7:52 this damn line had my grandpa dying of laughter in the theater, he liked the joke so much he called one of his friends during the movie just to tell them abt the scene LOL|, This movie really makes you _feel_ as though you're watching the movie where they go back in time to the first thanksgiving to get turkeys off the menu.|, 9:18 The most historically inaccurate thing about this movie is that they depicted Chuck E.

It really felt like it was trying to show how everyone should enjoy their lives, not paying attention to all the negative stuff happening around him. Brilliant film|, This movie was SO good!! It was so clever, funny, and self aware all at the same time. It genuinely made me laugh as well as consider the world of futuristic gaming and possible AI|, Definitely 10/10.I laughed so hard when Ryan showed up the shield and Chris Evans suddenly appeared as cameo 🤣🤣🤣|, I love how him and his wife are good close friends to Mariah and she’s working behind the scenes with connections in the film and theatre industry. Gosh i forgot how many great artists she’s helped getting them into high positions because she’s been surrounded by billionaire chairmen since she was a teenager. I’m so excited for her bio series|, Ryan Reynolds gets paid to be himself on camera at this point|, Honestly, this is really underrated. This whole movie felt like it was over in 10 minutes. You will not get bored even a 5 seconds while you are watching. I was not expecting this to be that good.|, Hell of a movie man. I didn't think it was going to be all that and was thinking how typical this movie was going to be. I hung in there and allow the story to build and build to the point where it got meaning. It got really good with a quirky love story to boot. I have to say it was brilliant. It's kinda tough in this day and age to find true love and harder to tell the other person how you feel about that them without being weird. To my surprise, this movie really made my day and released a lot of restrictions for a moment. It was funny, and sweet. With a reminder of PUBG thrown in lol.|, This is one the best movies I've ever seen. I'm so obsessed with this movie. It's great acting, story plot, awesome action, and emotional as well."

Everybody watching this knows that he makes it. He's fine. It's a success. The worry is over. Yet it's still impossible to watch and not be terrified.|, If I train for several months I think I can watch this.|, I’m calling it: this will NEVER be repeated by another human being. 
The combination of sheer talent, tenacity, ambition, opportunity and fearlessness I don’t think will ever come together quite like this again.|, I have no idea why I get so emotional watching this documentary, especially his climb. It brings tears to my eyes and a great sense of awe whenever I watch it. In my humble opinion, I believe this is one of the best documentaries in existence.|, Just saw this tonight in a packed theatre in Toronto and it blew my mind. Seriously one of the most exciting documentaries I've ever witnessed. Utterly thrilling and the story is brilliantly well told. The filmmakers and Alex did an incredible job. Just blown away. Really glad I saw it on a big screen as the scenery is utterly gorgeous. The entire theatre was so on edge and you could hear everyone holding their breath during the best bits. So good!!|, I don't climb but this was one of the absolute best documentaries I've seen in years. Heart stopping and shows the limit of the human mind and body. Incredible!|, I saw this twice in the theaters and only after my second time could I put words to the feelings I had from watching it. The first time I was shaking, tears streaming down my face during the entire climb. After getting back to my car I sat in silence with my brother for a good 10 minutes. There are no superlatives that describe what we just witnessed. It goes so far beyond words.....

The second time I saw it, watching the climb it came to me why I couldn't find words to put to what I felt. There are none. What you witness (bear with me here, it's about to go existential, so if that's not your thing keep scrolling, lol) is a glimpse at Alex's soul. It's not him your watching climb, but everything he is. It's an act of such purity, beauty, and joy that it transcends the physical and mental. It's ineffable and one of the most moving things I've ever experienced. Some of you might dismiss me as a weirdo, or whatever, lol, and that's fine. To those of you who felt what I did, and do, you'll understand completely.|, I saw this doc yesterday.  A monumental, unparalleled achievement unlike anything you will ever see.  It's nearly beyond comprehension.  With his uncanny climbing abilities, Honnold almost becomes a part of El Capitan during his ascent.  This film demands to be seen on as big a screen as possible.  You will not be disappointed."

As a descendant of one of those boys, I am very excited about this film and pleased to know that someone, somewhere has FINALLY acknowledged the fact that not every southerner was a slave-owner or a servant of slave-owners who caused the Civil War in hopes of growing richer.|, So excited to see my family's story being told.  What rich history we have but more importantly the acknowledgement of Newton's mixed race nation which is where I am most proud of -- Thank you Matthew McConaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Keri Russell as well as all the other actors for bringing this story to the public.|, Newton Knight was a truly fascinating person. I'm glad he's finally getting the credit he deserves. For the longest time people have romanticised Confederate generals who fought to divide the country and keep slavery, yet we ignore southerners who stood up for what was right.|, Fabulous movie. The story is not over yet. The war has always been between the rich and poor, strong and weak.|, Just saw this on netflix. Surprised it wasn't more popular. Excellent movie. McConaughey's acting top-notch.|, Despite negative reviews saying this felt like history channel documentary i thought it was intriguing, interesting, educational and important film. It doesn't go into that blockbuster civil war cliches, it just describes more intimate, personal story which is driven by great motives and unity against the oppressors. 
Great performances, good writing, interesting directing approach, subtle messages and much more it is truly mesmerizing movie. It doesn't insult, it doesn't stereotype, it is quality film and as a society we still have not evolved from limitations of our minds which are explored here. 4/5|, As a 6th Generation descendant of Newt and Rachel Knight I've been in love with this story since first hearing it on my grandmothers Knee :)|, This is one of the best films I’ve seen in a long time. 10 out of 10.

If that doesn't make you smile, I'm not sure you have a heart.|, The movie made me cry so much, knowing this is based on a true story.
I'm so happy that now things are changing, and that more and more people are open-minded|, Wow... I saw this movie a few minutes ago.  It's extremely deep and shows the heartache that same sex couples have gone through.  I'm glad to see my hometown county eventually got it right.  And shame on those that feel it necessary to condemn, make fun of, and/or make ridiculous comments regarding peoples lives.  It's not a gay movie... It's a movie about equality and the right that all people  should have when they are in a committed, loving relationship. Kudos to Julianne Moore and Ellen Page for an outstanding performance.|, I just watched the movie and it's beautiful. It's not just a love story, it's about being equal and doing the right thing.

Hope that more movies like this ""come out"" and to show that this love has to be respected.|, Já chorei com o trailer!! Pelo amor de Deus, alguém marca essa estreia!|, This movie really tore me up.

Friend Request,Friend Request – Official Trailer – Warner Bros. UK,llEP88wJqiY,1631992,6657,396,"For the people who check trailers here before watching….. this is a hidden gem. It is sort of like unfriended, but if unfriended took place on more than just a computer screen. It feels like a classic 2000s horror movie and I say that because of all the jump scares and hip college/school setting. Some of the jump scares were very tense and well done, others were predictable. This did not hurt the movie though, because I understand the style it aimed for I was able to focus more on the plot, which also was good. The suspense was there, the movie feels very eerie, and the story did a decent job unraveling without the plot losing substance. Give this one a watch👍🏽 Beware watching with headphones RIP my ears|, I always love both Unfriended and Friend Request. They're both supernatural computer horror films.|, Trust me this is the Best horror movie i have ever seen🥺 true epic horror...i had mini heart attacks in every scene🙏 amazing story n cinematography|, Well?i love a lot horror!this was one of the most  awesome movie I ve ever seen!loved it a lot!it s teaching us that every  dark person has a secret to hide and  that internet  is extremely  dangerous!😆|, i watched this movie not expecting much as the rating was poor, but it was surprisingly good and really creepy.

Every now and then I fall
Every now and then I lose control
In your eyes I see your thoughts surrounding me
And I've a little bit of thought for you

'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
Every time I stare into your eyes

Your thrills I find
It's not hard to be left behind
So I'll run, you'll hide
We know better than to stay outside

You're cold and your awake
You said I should have never of stayed
But there's no better place for me

'Cause every now and then I fall a bit behind
Every time I stare into your eyes|, I saw Dan at Firefly 2014, he had a small crowd in the beginning of the day and absolutely delivered.

R.I.P Oscar Grant|, RIP Oscar Grant III 🙏🏼 as someone who is also a Bay Area native/resident. This hits so close to home. I too take BART to the city for NYE (it’s what folks in the Bay Area like to do on NYE). I also would take BART to catch an A’s game. (Fruitvale station being the 2nd to last station for the coliseum station) You will never be forgotten, I’ll always have a place for you in my heart & think of you frequently. *Rest In Peace Oscar*|, I watched Fruitvale Station yesterday. Rest In Peace Oscar Grant🕊 I promise you’ll never be forgotten, and you *will* get justice. God will handle the evil officers who *murdered* and disrespected you. I want to learn more about you. I’ll be praying for you, your family, and especially your beautiful daughter Tatiana who hopefully I get a miracle to meet. I love you Oscar, they took away your life and you were gonna do great things. Rest up Oscar, I and we love you❤️|, This is the first movie that ever made me tear up and I rarely cry.|, Good movie, RIP Oscar. 

It’s sad that this is the world we live in now days. Praying for my boys daily, praying that they shall live and not die until the man upstairs say it is so. Praying that all of our young kings make it…in Jesus name, Amen!|, Sign of the times.

#10yearsago💎🎞|, I first was here because Billie said it was a good movie. Then I watched it and i really, really like it!!|, Really well made movie for anyone who has enough of Hollywood BS.|, This was actually my 1st time hearing about this case, after watching the movie, on TV. I also didn't know it was a true story till end of movie writing came on, about the case. So I made sure I watched it closely the 2nd time it aired, to see the details of what went down. Definitely a hate crime, first off how they were roughing them up, arresting them, and look like one of the cops, kicked a guy, between his legs. It's just so awful how so called ""peace officers "",with a uniform, badge, and gun, with so much hate, in their heart, for a race, can even take a job like that. They need to get spiritually clean, first. Lesson 1, in that area, when your hate is so great, you hate yourself first, and hate anyone who don't look like you. Love yourself, and you can better love others. They evidently either don't believe in God, that He is watching their actions, or they believe in a white supremacy god. There is a lower case god that runs that garbage truck, of white supremacy, and a whole lot of other negative garbage, and his name is Satan. And what kind of defense saying he thought he was   pulling out a taser gun. A gun they have to unsnap, to pull it out, plus the gun weight is heavier. He knew what he was doing. Another case of injustice. But God's got this. He said justice is MINE.
My heart goes out to his mother, his wife, and esp. to his daughter. The saddest part, as he laid there, after being shot, he said more than once, ""I have a daughter"" and at the end of the movie, his daughter, 10 years later still look like she lost her best friend. Dear heart, baby girl, let me tell you this, in hope, to comfort you, its obvious your daddy's heart was with you, because of his last words speaking about you. The Bible says what is bound on earth, is bound in heaven. So his heart was here with you, and I can believe he has been with you, all this time. God knew what He was doing when He made him, your daddy. He gave you a daddy that would show you love, and gave you more love than many other children never have had. So be thankful for that, and just keep doing something, in the memory, of your daddy's legacy, to keep his name, out there. His death was not, in vain, and he will be remembered. God bless you all. Rest in PARADISE  Oscar Grant III✌❤🙏🌷🌲🎵💃|, Is it really that much of a coincidence that the officer pulled the black guy out of the train instead of the white guy as well, despite them being equally as aggressive? Glad to see Amerikkka's finest doing their best work as usual."

I watched it when it first came out and again last night. heartbreaking but you follow the journey of these soldiers and the bonds they created.|, My grandfather was in the 2nd armored div.

I've had telepathic messages as well since I can recall back to 2 yo.....& have met a humanoid type being as well as beings of light energies, & 1 hologram.
There are many people who've also experienced such, & the time is coming soon that everyone will know 'they' are here.
There's more to these various beings than what most realize tho.....like attracts like, hence, it's advisable to attract the benevolent wise ones.|, I was woken up one night by something touching my face very lightly and gently.          I opened my eyes and caught a glimpse of something next to my bed.....I got up on one elbow and looked harder....... I thought I was hallucinating........ I wasn’t.........there were two beings standing next to me.......one behind the other.........they looked so kindly at me......exuding immense love.......they were silent...........after a minute or so they were gone     🥰🥰🥰|, I watch these type of things often because I believe. 

I grew up in the 70s and 80s, we didn't have technology so everything we learned was through experience or stories others told. Most people did believe and had a story as to why but then they'd say ""shhhh they'll put you in a straight jacket and lock you away for seeing, for knowing, for interacting"" so we just didnt talk about it unless in a place like ""camping"", but never at home, never in our daily lives. 

Now it's all over the place and most people still dont talk about it because... We know, we always have known. Not what we're fed, what we or someone we know witnessed. 

What is new to many is the variety of different Alien races. So now I'm wondering if a few different Alien races look human or a distorted version of human they why aren't they simply approaching the vast majority of people who would not be in shock and awe, but have a conversation, get the message and task, shake hands, take a few photos and post the story/agenda/message to a platform uncensored? Because realistically most people around the globe over age 40 would do just that, have a conversation then spread the word because most people over age 40 already know and would welcome most Alien species to a civil conversation then gladly do the task of telling the story, but we'd say ""we need a selfie together otherwise my story is like the others and thats a rabbit hole, been there, done that, doesn't work, give me something to work with"". 

This isn't rocket science, an advanced civilization would know that at least half the worlds population knows, and would welcome communication but would also require a picture, a clear undeniable picture or artifact in order to tell the story. They'd be prepared to offer that. Some might argue they wouldn't due to government but it's obvious government stood down on the topic and let the public run with their stories and still an advanced civilization offers only stories, speculation, Hologram, and imagination but nothing physical, nothing tangible, nothing verifiable? 

This isn't the 50's. We have technology to create whatever we can imagine good and bad. We can create a world of peace or destruction without letting anyone know the truth, because our technology is advanced enough to create our own reality or live in any simulation our faith resides. 

I enjoy all the Alien stories but for me, they are all just that, someone's story. 

To the Alien species of many, 
Approach civilians around the world classified as poverty without a history of substance abuse. They, along with America's southerners (red necks) and most RH negative blood types that know, have waited a very long time to find each other and a reason to walk away and join the civilization of ""live and let live"". An advanced civilization watching us for thousands of years would know this and would know all they needed to do was introduce these groups of people and you'd see world peace, unity, and a lot of people willing to do a lot to help you, help them keep it that way. 
And that is why these stories will never be a trigger. It will never be enough. The agenda would never take place. Waiting is only assuming those 40+ will die off and truth will be what someone else programmed the people to think. 

Good luck.|, It's very true there are other what we would call advanced beings besides ourselves ( humans) not all are from outer space but rather other dimensions.  The 5 human senses can only experience a small spectrum of what is really there. If one develops their 6th sense you become more open to interaction with them.

And please tell me somebody else cried of laughter during that bullet removal scene vomiting omgggg|, 2 things:
1. This movie is SO underrated.
2. Rachel McAdams is SO beautiful.|, Just finished watching! and I have to say this is one of my favourite comedies in a long while! pleasant surprise!  this movie had humour from all the characters that I just found so great! all the characters worked well together and some of the cast in this I never knew before, but they were great! really fun movie, deffo recommend this! go watch it!|, Not gonna lie, when this movie was announced in production i thought the concept seemed a bit dumb and lazy but man they filmmakers executed it very well. Really hilarious and one of the most underrated comedy movies ever made. Also appriciate the fact that this is a movie based on an original script, something we rarely see in Hollywood nowadays|, I really liked this movie.  It had me laughing throughout.  I especially like Rachel Mac Adams.  Not only is she adorably cute, she has great comedic timing.  I think most people think of her tear jerking roles, which are great .  However many at the same time, forget about her roles in “The Hot Chick”, “ Mean Girls”, and “ The Wedding Crashers”.   She shines comedically in these movies, as well as “ Game night”.    I hope she makes some more movies in the near  future.|, Jason and Rachel need to do more movies together. I loved their chemistry. So fun.|, This movie was very entertaining! It had humour that will hit the spot for most adults and it was fast paced keeping you on the edge of your seat through out the movie. A must watch!!!|, spoiler alert!!!

i LOVE the end credit scene where you can see how Gary planned to hijack the game. it gave the feel that it's real, not just a plot twist thrown in just for the sake of having plot twist. BRILLIANT|, This cast is crazy talented!"

She played the role amazingly and with a lot of emotions that were so real and natural! Applause for this actress and for GANGU‘s story being spread as it should!
Bring her story to life!!
Watch this movie!!|, Her growth from student of the year to gangubai makes me so proud of her, she’s come a long way 🥹🤍|, No one could have portrayed Gangubai better than Alia and I'm not saying this just because I'm her fan but you can't deny that she nailed it. Salute to all those women who fought to get their freedom and rights during that period. 🙌❤|, Watched this on Netflix. I don’t have words express how good and well executed this story is. Amazing. I’ve never been a fan of Alia but I have always admired her acting. After this my respect for Alia’s acting became more  big. I still can’t imagine some other actress doing this role not alia. She nailed the character. Loved the movie.|, Alia Bhatt left me stunned with her performance. When an actor can move you to tears, not just with her sadness, but even her smile, she is on to something.|, She nailed it. I am not an admirer of hers but I can't be a stupid to not praise the work she has done in this movie. She literally lived the character.|, I saw this movie and I didn't know that Alia can dance and act like this - a great movie directed by a Sanjay Leela Bhansali who know how to get the most out of his actors and actresses - truly a great inspirational movie based upon a true story.|, No one does really understand the struggles behind the person and pain in the heart. We do only judge which isn't done. I cried after watching Gangubai's real and painful story. How brave she was. Applause to this film and Bhansaali Saab for coming up with this project. Kudos|, Hats off to Alia and SLB from Korea! Gangubai Kathiawadi is currently #2 in Korean Netflix, which is even more impressive since it's the first time an Indian movie made the Top 10 list in Korean Netflix. So happy to see countless fellow Koreans on social network praising not just Alia's beauty, but also her power and charisma. Hopefully Netflix will take the hint and bring us other wonderful Indian cinema."

Thank you, Cindy|, ✨🦅⚡️Heard you loud and clear! I love you so much and thank you for this reading!|, You’re the consult for this queen 👑 Thank you and December blessings your way, Cindy ✨♊️♥️🎄|, This is an amazing reading!! And completely resonates. Thankyou for the heads up!!❤|, No gemini my chart but this absolutely resonate. I left the cleaning company I work for a few weeks ago to self employment. I have had 2 customers follow me (out of the 45 I did each fortnight) and my old company is sending messages to all my old customers and their upper management, to say bs about me. Its really stressful for me but im just keeping my head down and not playing into it. They are digging their own grave but it is affecting my hours and im a single parent so I really do need my hours. Feeling like I left to relieve myself from drama, only to be put right in the firing line. One day at a time 😢|, Hey Cindy, whenever I tap in,  your process has me smilin' and giggling; so special:) The first part really hit home; hehe, my story for the past few years.  

I married, knowing it didn't look good, but felt I was to do it. 

The whole journey has been rubber-hitting the road moments where my integrity and strengths were stretched....I would warn, Don't take my kindnesses for weakness, and as my mother used to say, Every shut eye ain't sleep;0).  

Unconditional love continued, but tough love got thrown into the mix.  Under the umbrella of Self-love, healthy non-attachment, letting go, and boundaries manifested.

35yrs down the road and I see my growth/ evolving, and the partner, well, he made choices that set up these natural consequences of separation, though we still are under the same roof, omg.

It looks like I'm kinda stuck, to be brief, but I believe in miracles and continue to call more in:)

re the bad-mouthing or undermining....It's unbelievable and I've known about it like forever. Even recently, neighbours pulled me aside to tell me how they were in disbelief at the things he was saying about me( he's really loud on his cell;0) This is how a perpetual victim acts...Oh Brother! But the man is no longer mah biznezz;0)

The hard part is that no one understands my walk. It has bothered me how I might be judged as being in denial etc, and how I can continue to move through all this and be, in my highest aligning and continued trust, though I've had my wobbles/doubt in my journey....But Spirit encourages me with the word, That's because it's Your revelation, and not theirs.

Hehe, so I continue in my flow, in my gratitude for what I have, faithful to release my pain of heart when it bubbles up, and anticipate the expansion of the magical be-ing that I am....hehe, Alchemist at Work, even in stillness, says the Hermit:) xoxo

May my words be an encouragement to another. May each of us Rock our Journies to their highest good!!!

...with all my love, I am that, I am. xoxoxoxox|, Love love this and you! Thank you! 🤍🤍🤍|, This feels like  2021 when I was so done with coworkers and the big bosses. I saw no more toxic people I left the day on my job anniversary. No matter if a raise came I said I need to take care of me and work alone.|, Thank you for this reading. In my world, it relates to the recent message regarding abuse. Still trying to find a way out, but at least the fear and confusion is dissolving. At some point I’ll have to file for divorce and begin the legal process, but I can’t even buy tampons and toilet paper, so I’m not feeling great about a court battle. But the fear and confusion and overwhelm is gone, so I’m grateful for that. Thanks, Cindy!"
Gemini Man,Gemini Man (2019) - Official Trailer - Paramount Pictures,AbyJignbSj0,23250419,176072,13271,"Imagine if he wins best actor and best supporting actor at the academy's!|, Much respect for people that play more than 1 role in a movie. Just imagine having to rehearse each line for each character. That’s a lot of hard work!|, I don't care what critics say. This is a great film with a great execution and great themes. Ang Lee, you're great.|, What I love about this movie is that it's unapologeticly digital. 4K 60 frames per second, no fake film grain, no desaturated colors, no oversaturated colors, it's got a nice clear sterile look with natural true to life colors. So sick of action movies being shot at 24fps and trying to emulate the celluloid film look. I want that clarity, I want that detail and sharpness, I want to see the action, I don't want to watch some blurry desaturated grainy nonsense. Kudos to Ang Lee for doing his own thing.|, As a Gemini I approve of this movie and actors.|, Took my family to this movie today. Man it was cool. My wife and son both loved it too. I give it a 9 out of 10 stars. Very awesome gun fights and chases. Very realistic story. This is the best movie I have seen in two months, and I have seen one every week.|, When you can't find a better actor than Will Smith so you cast him twice|, I was quite surprised at how good this movie is. The story isn't so much about the action as it is about a couple moral themes on facing yourself, in this case literally, dealing with the moral consequences of a death dealing lifestyle, and using those experiences to prevent the same corruption of someone else. On the flip side, while I think the ending for the bad guy should've been different, it did a great job of showing what happens to people when there's no real love from a father figure, only a distorted teaching of respect and reasoning. The structural consequential frailty of playing God is balanced out by the fact you can always change.....if you so choose. Key scenes do very good at raising emotions and questions, so I highly recommend this movie to anybody who likes smooth flowing thought provoking tales.|, Hollywood's certainly getting bold with their casting choices with these adaptations, never thought I'd see the day where Will Smith plays Big Boss and Solid Snake.|, This movie has some badass action scenes, and Will Smith just nailed this role. Even this trailer is epic!"

Geostorm,GEOSTORM - OFFICIAL TRAILER 2 [HD],EuOlYPSEzSc,17759444,65877,5339,"The only person who can survive the Geostorm is the Cameraman.|, If you go to the movies for entertainment and if you liked movies such as Armageddon, then I can't understand why you wouldn't like Geostorm. The story was original, relevant, and I thought the cast did a great job. I read that some professional critics found the movie to be ""uninspiring"". We really have a major problem on our hands when a movie that discusses a potential scenario relating to climate change (something very important) is deemed ""uninspiring""!|, Normally one should avoid any movie with '-storm' in the name for the 95% chance of it being a B-movie, but this was awesome. I didn't check the details, so when Gerald Butler entered the scene I had a smile on my face.The weather events were all little too comical i.e. a tsunami in a desert, but overall really awesome. Next bit is about the ending, so SPOILER:

The ending was a bit cheesy though. Every human being having the look on their face of 'we've been saved'. Normally people would've been terrified. Neither can you tell me that storms that have been conjured up just subside 5 seconds after pressing a button. Actually humanity is still screwed because the 'net' was the only thing keeping earthly phenomena from going nuts. Guess this is the Independence Day-syndrome. These days movies have become more realistic, so I wish they would've done that with the ending too, but guess a typical Hollywood ending will have to suffice. Otherwise really great movie though!|, I can't believe how good this movie was. I just came back from seeing it, and I definitely recommend it. It's got a perfect mix of action, drama, and humor.|, i just watched this movie and if ur not sure if its worth a watch you should know its worth every single second of ur life i swear i rate this movie 100/10 i have good tastes for movies, this movie was and is epic i would love to watch it again
.. and the special effects??  *mind blown*|, ""a normal day in 2021""|, Inspired by true events ;)|, Ok...now I'm interested!!!...Good trailer and I feel it has just the right amount of ""over the top destruction""....something that most disaster movies often lack. Let's hope this doesn't disappoint.|, We went from a dark and gritty teaser, to a action-packed yet comedy-like trailer. A pretty strange transition there.|, This was a surprisingly very good movie with a great concept and some superb SFX and production design. And watch out for Nathan from MISFITS aka Robert Sheehan in a key role!!!"

It is the best time I've ever had in a cinema|, This movie is the perfect example that a horror movie doesn't always need a ghost to be scary
I mean this movie is bone chilling 
And those jumpscares were 😣|, I feel so bad for those that didn't ""get out""|, they should make a ""prequel"" not a ""sequel"" to this. going deep into how the family discovered the idea and who were the first candidates...|, This was really the first horror movie I became really obsessed with. I watched this trailer over and over again studying it being scared by it and eventually working up the courage to watch it. I had it spoiled but this film still truly blew me away. This was the start of my journey into Horror. Starting from wading my foot into the water of the genre with this film and a few others and than to the horror movie Junkie I am now having seen almost 100 and beginning to write my own horror film. Thank you Get Out.|, Imagine being a black man and you meet your white girls’ white parents for the first time. Go to their house, hang out, have dinner, then everybody sits down to watch a movie and this one gets picked...|, This movie is insanely good. The cinematography is incredible and the tension so subtle it works greatly. The twists ARE twists and are unpredictable!|, Just watched this film. Absolutely great stuff. There's so many run-of-the-mill 'horror' films that don't do the name of the genre justice, but once in a while you see one that restores your faith. This was properly creepy, and that's exactly what you need in a horror, not just blood and gore. I saw a review likening it to The Skeleton Key, and I absolutely get that... very similar premise... that was also one of those films that caught me by surprise when I first saw it... Orphan was another. If anyone's got any recommendations for similarly creepy films, then please tell me.|, This is an example of an EXCELLENT ""psychological"" horror ..a horror that doesnt have any monsters,  any FICTIONAL characters, not even bloody or gory but downright SCARY. I saw this when it first came out and another thing i REALLY loved about the movie is that it wasn't ""predictable"" and it wasn't a SLOW burn. It gets your attention right away and KEEPS it. You won't even want to pause it to go pee."

And the whole, ""There hasn't been a ghost sighting in 30 years"" line. Spot on.|, I love how Finn went from dressing as a ghostbuster in Stranger Things to being an actual one in this movie|, I just now watched the movie. This was incredible. Start to finish. Ending was emotional. 
Thank you for amazing memories from the past with this amazing movie.|, I value the 80’s original, but this was an exquisite film. All around. From every angle. A stellar cast, humorous dialogue with phenomenal cinematography. Even the computer- generated imagery was on point, classy and subtle. Loved it. Kudos!. Much respect.👻|, This was an excellent sequel - perfect mix of nostalgia, humor and action. I loved how they included the original actors so seamlessly and the homage to Harold was extremely respectful. The other Ghostbusters movie were utter garbage and a disgrace, and now I can finally forget that they ever existed with this beauty!|, Bring Harold into the picture is respectfully brilliant. May harold continues resting in peace. I like how some of us who seen 1984 film can relate to this. Seeing the crew together one last time is was a honor. Thanks to Harold family to allow cgi.|, Finn Wolfhard is gonna be an 80s Star without ever even living in the 80s|, This movie was phenomenal! Really faithful to the original. Rest in peace Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman|, Just watched it today. It’s story was great, it’s acting was awesome, the jokes were well timed and reminiscent of the original ghost busters and the plot was original but still payed respects to the original trilogy. Most parts even made me cry, and I’m not even an OG fan. Great movie, the critics can say what they want, but 93% of the people have spoken, we want more!|, I was born in 1983. I have been a huge Ghostbusters fan my entire life, with the first film being my absolute favourite. When Ghostbusters 2 was released in 1989, I was so excited to go and see it, so my dad took me to see it in the theater in January of 1990 for my seventh birthday.

Up until that time, I was used to The Real Ghostbusters children's cartoon, as well as the first film in it's ""censored for TV"" form. I watched it on a 14"" CRT TV that had a dial to tune into 13 different channels at the time. The experience of the first film was thus ""dialed back"" significantly from its original release in theaters, and as such, I was not prepared for the Cinema experience of the sequel. The bigger screen (biggest in the city at the time), coupled with the much louder audio experience, meant that when Vigo shot lightning out of his eyes, I was suddenly very, very scared, and I made my dad take me out of the movie halfway through.

I'm 38 now and this film gets released in 2021. I invite my father out to come and watch it with me. I told him that I have a debt to repay 31 years in the making. This time, we both watch the full thing, straight through. And we both agreed, this film is a fantastic third entry into the Ghostbusters franchise.

I love you, Dad."

We played it at his funeral.  His little 11 year old granddaughter sang it out loud and proud. They sang it together all the time.  Beautiful memories 😢😢😢 The last concert he was at was the stones in Dublin with his daughters and eldest grandson. This was the song he wanted all night. Thank you for playing it. ❤❤|, It still gives me chills after 50 years.|, Does anyone else get chills when Merry Clayton's voice breaks? Because I sure do.|, Many music critics and fans consider ""Gimme Shelter"" the greatest song ever produced by the Stones. Include me in that group. I always thought it was amazing that they kept Merry Clayton as the background singer since her powerful vocals dominate the song. It didn't seem like something that Jagger's ego could handle. But she contributed her parts in a few takes, which Jagger remarked was ""pretty amazing.""|, I can never get enough of that dark multi-layered guitar riff intro by Keith Richards echoing around Merry Clayton’s soaring vocal. It never grows old, I’ve loved it since I heard it as child in the early 70s. It’s the greatest intro I’ve ever heard in a rock song, it will never be bettered 🙏🏽|, This opening riff still sends chills. Absolutely haunting"

He absolutely murdered his role in this movie! (No pun intended)
His acting skills are improving leaps and bounds, its a nice thing to behold.|, This is the Definition of  ""As kids we admire the heroes, as we grow up we start to understand the villains""|, This movie is incredible. It is not a typical blockbuster.Nevertheless what critics and some people say it is an A movie.The acting,the score, the meaning behind it,even the pacing is appropriate for a deep psychological analysis of characters. It sets up it's own standards as a movie. It is clear why it didn't get a recognition it deserved.|, James McAvoy blew my mind with his acting. Simply incredible.
As far as the movie goes I have to say it's one of the best I've seen this year. Probably one of the most interesting and fascinating stories.
I just finished it and kind of want to watch it again.|, This movie will be remembered as an all time trilogy epic. Thank you Mr. Shyamalan for this original screenplay!|, They should really give James McAvoy an oscar for such a role with 23 personalities.|, What an epic end to this grand trilogy! Love the way he connected everything in this one. James McAvoy is out of this world! Unbelievable actor. Thanks, Mr. Shyamalan, for these three masterpieces. 
*22nd November 2023*|, The ending that the main characters get was fantastic. I love how massively understated it was! It was quite haunting how the 3 most powerful characters didn't get the big hoorah they wanted. I love having my expectations completely defeated and they were! Loved it.|, I love this trilogy soooooo much.
Thing that blows me away is how film critics can give any of the 3 films a bad review .
Unbreakable, was a different idea of the superhero genre and how it could be true and done.
Split, was the craziest twist when you heard that music score and then Bruce Willis gave me chills.
Glass, a beautiful rollercoaster of a story that maybe it's just a mental health issue, fitting for our time, but then it's a secret group that kills the superheroes to keep the status quo.

So amazing."

Check out the 80s Hits Party Playlist 💃🏼🥂🕺🏻 https://lnk.to/80sPartyMusicYC|, This song always reminds me of my mother. She had a pretty hard life, 2 divorces one from an abusive alcoholic, raised 4 kids, and died at 42 of cancer. But on occasion this song would play on the radio and she'd forget her worries for just a moment and sing it like Laura Brangahan herself. My best memories was when I was in college and we went to 2 weddings within 2 years and we danced to this practically clearing that dance floor.  I just remember her wide smile and how happy she was in the moment. After the 2nd wedding, she was gone by the following year, but before she went I played this for her in the hospital and tho she couldn't sing, she flashed that signature smile. This song will forever and always be her song to me.|, Her voice is phenomenal!|, Maravillosa  voz.|, Timeless classic, never get tired listening to her songs over and again 😊|, This is a really hard song to sing. Even in the original recording by Umberto Tozzi, you can hear he struggles a little to hit the high notes with the same emphasis and punchiness each time. Branigan absolutely nails it here; it's absolutely magnificient.|, One of the most prettiest women I have ever seen stunningly beautiful. R.I.P Laura Brannigan|, We lost her way too soon.

By the way I was in the moment I read Julianne Moore was in this.|, We need more films that show women as heroes and not victims. Love Julianne Moore and what a great choice for her leading man, John Turturro! Can’t wait to see it!|, Julianne Moore never fails to impress.

I grew up a Christian but slowly drifted away from God and his Grace. However, recently, Jesus has touched my heart in a way I have not felt in forever (because I ignored his calls). I was miserable, swore like a sailor and was just overall not a good person. Jesus gave me strength and reminded me what is it like to have the grace of God. I'm finally happy again through the love and grace of Lord God! Praise Lord God and the son Jesus Christ!|, song like this never gets old ❤|, God called me back today. I used to listen to this song nonstop as a kid at church, even tho i´m from Brazil. My hole family is christian and I´ve never really stoped going to the church. But today God called me to be His daughter again, not just another believer. I remembered this song immediatly. it´s never too late to go back and cry yourself for forgiveness and ask for peace in my heart. I do believe He really loves me, He just showed it, and i´ve never felt more loved in my hole life.|, My wife and I seen them Newsboys near Flint Michigan about a year ago. They were awesome and Franklin Graham preached a great sermon. People came to the Lord at the end of the service. God Bless them all.|, Just saw ya'll in real life playing this song on stage Jacksonville, FL. LOVE IT. GOD IS NOT DEAD HE IS SURELY ALIVE"

God's Own Country,God&#39;s Own Country Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Indie,ki3B3C2tGBQ,1190156,8873,711,"Just finished seeing this film. A movie with two gay men with a tender happy ending! No break-ups (like ""Call Me By Your Name""), no tragic deaths (like ""Brokeback Mountain""). Simply happiness. Finally! But what places this film above and beyond any movie in any genre is the incredible acting. The main protagonist, the silent, brutish English guy, is INCREDIBLE. Can this man act!  And the actress who plays his grandmother--another acting genius. They can say so much with just looks, it's truly a wonder to see. There's not a lot of dialogue, and when there is dialogue it's to emphasize how much these people hide their true feelings with bland talk of farm stuff. Definitely no oral exposition happens. It just has looks and stares. Lots and lots of looks and stares. But, damn, do those looks and stares say everything, about this man's devastatingly limited life, about his family's and community's reaction to him being openly gay, about this blossoming relationship with a hottie Romanian that literally changes him for the better. Very little is spelled out for you. But it's a great film because of it since you need to fill in the details yourself. 11 out of 10 in my book.|, Seriously, you're going to need a box of tissues for this film. Performances by every single actor are sublime, writing is sublime, pacing is sublime, cinematography is sublime, music.... you guessed it.... sublime. This film will wrench your heart out, take it to pieces and give it back to you. I haven't cried like this in a film... ever I don't think. 

Human love is beautiful, in every form.|, Such an incredibly simple, direct and relatable story. No pretentious jaw-breaking and tongue-twisting phrase chewing. Just a few people finding peace, and love, through understanding.|, The scene where Gheorghe prepares dinner for them and checks the salt... left me completely... in love ✨ What a beautiful movie !! Thank you 💚|, Absolutely stunning film that is now right up there among my all-time favourites. It's sensual and romantic; and raw and ugly at the same time which is actually quite an accomplishment. The partnership between O'Connor and Secareanu is incredibly effective.  Along with a breathttaking scenery and the haunting melodies of A Winged Victory for the Sullen, it's truly a film to remember and cherish.|, I love this film so much. The story of 2 people, one tender and open about his affection, one rough and closed off. It's really heartening seeing them two come together, seeing Gheorghe help Johnny learn how to love beyond the physical sense. AND it has happy ending! Please watch and give this film a lot of love, it certainly deserves much more.|, I can honestly say that I have never related so much to a film before. As well as having incredible acting, stunning scenery and such a beautiful romantic story, it truely portrays the intmacy, passion and energy of love, how it can get you out of the rut you are in, and make you see yourself and your life in new ways. I've only felt that with one person, and even though it did not have a happy ending, it really lifted me up and showed me there was so much more to life, and those changes have stayed with me. I was an emotional wreck by the end of it, my favourite film of all time for sure. Everyone involved in the making of it should be so proud.|, Sometimes you need to find the right person to find yourself. A wonderful love story about how the right kind of 'stranger' can brighten up one's gloomy life, even by putting the salt on his cup-noodle, or by showing how to be tender despite being strong. John needed that tender loving care that he did not consciously know he missed so much until Georgi brought it to him. A movie worth watching! :)|, I just finished watching this movie and it’s by far one of the best I’ve watched in a long time. From the scene where his dad puts his hand on his hand and says thank you made me burst into tears to his nan and dad understanding. I’m so happy that he managed to find him and be with someone who truly loves him. Masterpiece! 😍😍|, This is such a beautiful movie, the development of the characters', especially John, is notable here. Gheorghe seems to make him a better person, and I especially adored the nice ending. I don't regret seeing it"

It seems like fans LOVED it and critics hated it. The special effects were awesome, the story was intriguing….anyone who’s into this type of fantasy stuff will love this flick. Highly recommend!|, The character design and animation for the gods and demi-gods was really cool! And the subtle differences between man and god such as height, gold blood, ""magic/wisdom/etc."" and badass metal forms are very amazing ideas that blend great together and the idea that even gods die is very interesting and might represent change is just a part of life! I really love how they made the ""godly"" form coenside with the Egyptian descriptions and that not all of them transformed the same way or not at all is very creative. The journey and plot are really well planned and simple but not too simple. The civilization design and incorporation of religous beleifs/descriptons are original with a hint of moderncy. The personalities in the characters were very well acted and showing that even gods can have faults is really cool. I just really liked it a lot! lol|, Am I the only one who loves this movie? I watch it in 3D and its really good! 😊|, This movie was sick! :D I loved the effects, chatacters, acting and story! Amazing work!|, If you like fantasy type movie's then this is an awesome watch. I can honestly say I was glued to this the whole way through. Great storyline, Great acting, Great effects 9/10|, just watched the movie and it was simply wonderful. one of the greatest visual effects in history, it makes everything absolutely real and intense, like you're really there in person, besides a great story and accurate respect for Egypt's mysticism.|, I saw this movie and honestly, I loved it. Some of the mythology was faulty and incorrect though. The fact that I was obsessed with Egyptian mythology when I was younger and that I find it nearly impossible for me to dislike most movies probably contributed to why I liked it so much.|, Not the best movie when it comes to story and accurate history, but still, an extremely good movie for many unexpected reasons. The special effects were great and really made me experience how great the Egyptian empire was, I can't quite explain it. I could just feel how huge and complex the buildings were and how much effort went into making them. The special effects didn't only look good but they also made a significant emotional impact and that's exactly what movies are about. The whole movie was a lot of fun to watch, I was smiling from the start to the finish. The deaths of some of the main characters were quite unexpected and emotional, very good job there. Even though the whole plot made little sense and was predictable, I could tell the writers and director did that on purpose. They made a fun movie and had fun making it. I can honestly say that this movie, unexpectedly, had a big emotional impact on me. Even though most don't like it, I completely disagree.|, I loved this movie. It's a fantasy allegorical movie with mythical characters so I wasn't too concerned about the ethnicity of the actors playing the characters.|, I just watched this movie it was fantastic Fantasy war Power and true love I shed many tears for this movie"

But the Alligator shoots laser beams and is the size of a skyscraper.|, The fact this film didn’t get nominated for best special effects is beyond me. Overall this fight was beautifully done. Kindaaa wish the first fight was on skull island but it’s all goods lol|, I remember watching this at theaters, When Kong punches Godzilla everyone cheer out loud but When Godzilla slaps Kong and knocking him on the ground 80% half of the audience went dead silent 🤣|, That slow-mo shot of Kong avoiding Godzilla's atomic breath is still absolutely epic.|, You got to admire kong for still fighting Godzilla in the ocean he didn’t cower away he stood his ground|, I just like how aggressive Godzilla is  getting on the carrier and was like "" You order some radioactive a$$ whipping?""|, I love how the ship didn't sunk after 2 big Kaijus climbed on it|, Seeing this in theatres was nothing short of astounding.

Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"Nuclear Godzilla vs King Ghidorah | Godzilla: King of the Monsters [4k, HDR]",5BxqahE0fu8,101253656,1039819,65260,"0:56 This is probably my favorite part of this whole scene. The way Ghidorah, now crippled, falls to the ground and desperately tries to get away from Godzilla while blasting him to no effect. For the first time in this movie, possibly his entire life, this demonic, sadistic monster is absolutely _terrified._|, Almost 4 years later and this scene is still as kickass as it was in theaters! Gives me chills!!!|, Props to the translators who studied Kaiju language just to give us the subtitles for this most dangerous documentary.|, Mothra's pattern and scream in each of the Godzilla nuclear surges is absolutely incredible..|, Ghidorah’s original home planet was said to be Venus. We don’t know if this is true in the modern Monsterverse, but he at least had to come from a planet similar to Venus’ climate and atmosphere which means he should be used to extreme heat. So I can only imagine how hot Nuclear Godzilla must’ve gotten to literally burn Ghidorah’s wings and two heads off.|, I love that little detail where every time nuclear Godzilla released his orange blast, you could hear Mothra's shriek and you could see her wings. So I guess Mothra's death was not in vain.|, Godzilla: Saves the world twice
Humans: The world needs Kong|, 1:00 is still one of the, if not the, most menacing and awesomely terrifying looks of Godzilla in the Monsterverse ever. When he smiles as Ghidorah is desperately shooting him with their Gravity Beams that have no effect anymore is just so chilling. If Ghidorah could shit their pants, it would be at that moment.|, Give the CGI animators a round of applause for making ghidorah and burning godzilla look so OP|, The moment at 0:21 where we see the effects of Godzilla's incredible temperature before we even see him is just a brilliant visualization."

Helen is THE person to play Golda, one of the most iconic people in history|, Spot-on performance. No one will ever agree with all the details and motivations portrayed in any movie based on such a volatile history, but Helen once again showed her metal in portraying a tough old leader in an impossible position.|, I saw this as a play in Toronto many years ago, and the strangest thing happen. At the very end, the silence in the audience was overwhelming, and as if planned and rehearsed, the entire audience began singing Hatikvah and the applause that followed lasted for several minutes. I hope this happens in the theatres. Helen Mirren is certainly made to look like Golda, that I had shivers going up and down my back!  Except for voice, (impossible to duplicate), she looks, dresses and walks like Golda!! Another Academy Award, that is if Barbie doesn't take it!!! Never can predict the Academy voters, some of whom are outspoken antisemitics/antiisrael.|, This is quite good.

I rewatched the entire movie right after watching it the first time. Amazing. So well done. I can't imagine how anyone could be disappointed.|, The story and characters are going to have to be superb considering most people already know what the twist is. Nothing worse than waiting for the twist to happen when you already know it and the story is dragging.|, This is definitely the best movie I seen… ever. And it shows you how people take grief seriously and differently|, The og is one of my faves but Naomi Watts never disappoints when it comes to horror so I’ll be watching:)|, When I saw the name Naomi Watts, I wanted to watch the movie but I got bored watching, then came the climax which took the movie to another level. I literally cried watching the climax.  Naomi never disappoints her fans! 👍🏾|, Naomi is so so so underrated! Her acting is never bad or even mediocre. She's always giving it her all. That said this looks great! I""ll sub to prime for a month to watch this, more than likely.|, This looks alright. Will definitely check it out. You cant go past a good low budget thriller that still has high production value.|, Naomi Watts is almost always in suspense thrillers. Love her!|, The original is one of the best horror films ever. The remake has a lot to live up to.|, Wow honestly I did not see that coming at all! Fantastic movie I loved it!"

Bro went absolutely fucking insane. The level he’s at is completely unmatched. Effortlessly spazzes with his flow|, Denzel is one of the few rappers that can rap fast without it being corny.|, I'm the only one who gets goose bumps when he starts rapping? holy shits, he kills it|, Can’t believe how big he’s getting, finally getting the credit he deserves|, Sounds like a mix of gangsta, psychadelic, and a bit of new school... Perfect combo.|, 3 years and this song is still underrated smh|, Denzel killing this shit, only one of the few guys who actually deserved their spot on XXL.|, I saw him perform at a festival once and he has hands down the best live show I've ever seen|, Denzel killin' it as usual.

I am so down for this! So glad to be having actual Halloween movies for Halloween this year!|, The CGI in this looks really good and even if the original cast isn't in it I'm still gonna go see it bc I love the tv show and books. All in all just the concept alone is dope.|, I m looking forward for part 2 ... coz I loved the first one and I know this movie is also going to be good.. Hollywood always makes awesome movies..|, I can't wait for Goosebumps 2! Been waiting 3 years for a sequel and now I've finally got it!|, i love this cast but i love the other one more, maybe if they combined it would be better :)|, I wanted the old cast|, I had my initial doubts but this looks like it could be pretty good. The creatures actually coming from somewhere makes it fairly scary, and it doesn't try so hard to be a nostalgia fest. I can dig it.|, This honestly feels more like a teaser trailer. Mainly due to the fact that half of the trailer consisted of footage from the first movie.|, I’m 100% gonna go watch this when it comes out"
Gotti,Gotti 1996 FULL MOVIE FULL HD 1080p,Zh-xHOtURxc,3918979,31010,4874,"I watched this many times and it's amazing how Armand blows me away everytime with this performance. One of the most accurate portrayals of John Gotti and the mob lifestyle. This is an underated movie for sure.|, The way Armand Assante walks and moves is 1000% Gotti. What an awesome piece of acting he did|, Honestly, one of the best opening monologues of ANY crime movie, including The Godfather. 
You see, even in a made for TV movie, it can be something special when the writers actually TRY.|, One of my favorite comfort movies ever . The dialogue and music is so soothing . They don’t make them like this anymore 😔|, The way Armand says “consider the source” in the scene where Quinn visits him in jail is so authentic. Its such a simple dialogue, but the delivery is so so perfect. Asante is a powerhouse.|, “5 or 10 years from now their going to miss John Gotti”. Powerful monologue|, I see everybody in the comments giving Anthony Quinn and Armand all the credit for their acting skills and it’s rightly deserved. But I think the guy who played Sammy the Bull did an amazing job as well. This movie has the best acting of any mafia movie I’ve ever seen.|, Seen this movie so many times and it never gets old..what a performance by all.|, Who else is here because Micheal Franzese said this was the most accurate Mafia production ever made👍|, I’ve seen this movie more than 100 times. First time was 2009. Great movie, great actors, great music soundtrack 🎉"
Gran Turismo,GRAN TURISMO - Official Trailer (HD),GVPzGBvPrzw,18239280,190347,10762,"So stoked for this!|, This is one of the few times I've seen an entire movie theater go nuts at the end of a movie. Absolutely fantastic. I really hope we get more video game movies with this type of quality.|, As a gamer and a racing fan, the movie was something which couldn't be described, like the roller coaster of emotions, wish I could watch it again for the first time.|, This brought tears to my eyes. I remember playing Gran Turismo to help with my driving lessons. When used with the steering wheel set, it felt as real as it gets and helped me a great deal - held my license for 10 years plus now and this game helped a great deal. Watched this movie and it is awesome - A must-see!|, What a great film. I didn't think a movie like this was even possible this year. Definitely Top Gun/Karate Kid vibes. Solid story, surprisingly good performances and completely devoid of the MESSAGE. Nothing really exceptional here but it hits all the right beats.|, Just saw it today and it was even way better than what the trailer depicts or what I initially expected! The story line, the action, the drama was intense and emotional as well which is what makes this movie so awesome!|, This looks awesome!!😎😎|, I'm not a Gran Turismo fan, but just being a gamer in general. This brought tears into my eyes.|, Holy crap this movie was actually really good. It really went above and beyond my expectations. I'd highly recommend it and id honestly watch it again|, As someone who knew little to nothing about the games and was so sick of seeing the trailer every time I went to see something else,this is by far the biggest surprise I’ve seen all year. While any film that is based or inspired on a true story is most likely more fake than actually true,it’s still a well written film just on its own. The character development and acting is really strong and can get quite emotional. The racing sequences have a unique style to them that remain both intense and fun at the same time. With all that being said,It’s a really well made film based off of a real life story and a video game at the same time. It blends so much together and manages to balance it out quite nicely. Definitely one I’d rewatch many times in the future and hopefully one that doesn’t remain forgotten."

Gravity,Gravity by John Mayer,7VBex8zbDRs,76200489,380477,13566,"Depression has been my gravity. I’ve had everything and still dreamt of ways to throw it all away. This song speaks to my soul. God bless you John Mayer 🙏❤️|, When he sings ""just keep me where the light is"" my goodness I cry every single time. This song is perfection.  💙|, Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, I'll never known what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Whoa, gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Oh twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Whoa, gravity, stay the hell away from me
Whoa, gravity has taken better men than me
Now how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on keep me where the light is
Come on keep me where, keep me where the light is.|, WOW ❤❤❤|, This song was an instant timeless classic... it simply does not get sonically better than this.|, That’s a nice song I heard for the first time on The Voice! Love it!❤❤❤|, when I was 6 years old, my dad would play John Mayer's songs to help me sleep and calm down because of my anxiety. His songs still help me just as much today ❤|, First time hearing this song October 14th 2023.. Absolutely Wonderful,  definitely adding as a repeat on my play list ❤✝️❤️|, Dude it's amazing how John Mayer can put you in a calm vibe and get you through hard times it's really mind blowing!!!|, This song has saved my life more times than I can count. Just being able to relate to something so much helps.  I've been going through it for about 7 years now and I'm just thankful to still be here."
Green Book,Green Book (2018) - At The Orange Bird Jukejoint Scene (9/10) | Movieclips,eiqBbLVXbQg,2999990,25275,1415,"I’ve worked in restaurants sorta like this, and the chef walking out of the back to see wtf is going on is such a nice touch|, The house band offering to let you play with them is the greatest compliment a musician can receive|, As a pianist, I can tell you all that it takes a crazy amount of precision, coordination, and memory to play something like THAT without music.|, What i really enjoyed about this film was the look of awe, respect and admiration that Tony had for Don every time he laid his hands on the keys. In the film, I think Tony really had a passion for Don's music after hearing it the first time, and Viggo really sold that look EVERYTIME.|, I love how happy Doc looks. After playing countless times for people who just see him as a 'tool' to be entertained, he's being cheered on by a crowd who truly appreciates his talent, and supported by a band who enjoys playing alongside him. This is probably the first time, at least since becoming a famous musician, that he feels welcomed.|, When he started playing Chopin I almost cried. Perfect to show ones emotions through playing. So much can be said through someone's playing.|, I love the fact even though the crowd was taken aback by his initial song, they still clapped enthusiastically. Exactly the type of vibe I love from a club.|, I dont often watch films like this, but this has changed my mind.
Honestly, thought this film was a masterpiece.|, It doesn’t matter where you are at, or what type of music you are into. When something like that is played live, it touches your soul.|, This movie was awesome. It deserved to win best picture. Viggo was robbed!!!! These two men formed a lifelong friendship and changed each other for the better. I wouldn’t mind having either as a friend."
Green Room,Ken Carson - Green Room (Official Audio),AFTkc39TYiQ,266989,4596,194,"This song is so good that it makes me feel like I could be Batman, like you could be Batman. It wouldn’t even be that difficult, I just gotta get the gadgets.|, This song is so fucking fire bruh it couldn’t have been better by the slightest increment not even the worlds greatest renowned psychiatric hospital could figure how the thought crossed your mind to make this|, what a time to be alive in the golden age of hip hop|, I dont think no artist has ever dropped the same album twice and still do  crazy numbers that's crazy 🔥🔥🔥🐐|, No bs this is one of the best albums I’ve heard THIS YEAR. Thank you Ken|, album so good he had to drop it twice|, This song is too good. It’s not so good, no it’s literally too good|, That beat got me ASCENDING 🔥🔥|, The only person who can drop the same album twice and still sound brand new🔥|, Thank you Ken Carson you changed my life. I am truly a different man after listening to this beautiful album. You keep growing every time you drop. Your music resonates with me on a deep level, connecting to my emotions in ways I never thought possible. Each track is a journey, taking me to places I've never been before. Your talent shines through every lyric, every beat, and I can't help but be inspired by your artistry. Your music has become the soundtrack to my life, and I am forever grateful for the impact it has had on me."
Gretel & Hansel,GRETEL &amp; HANSEL Official Trailer (2020),QZblQLhKcZQ,30131428,51774,8501,"Just visually, this movie looks absolutely gorgeous.|, My favorite film of 2020. Saw it twice in the theaters. Really incredibly beautiful cinematography, great acting by Sophia Lillis and especially by Alice Krige. Some people complained that it was slow or boring or without much plot. However, fairytales are not necessarily heavy on plot...they are teaching something...and this movie has a lot to say if you pay attention.|, This movie is so worth it. The detail is amazing and the story is just jaw dropping. If you are into creepy witches and scary movies this is definitely the movie for you.|, Utterly adored this film. And if you appreciate beautifully shot, perfectly paced, slow-burning arthouse films with very grim/dark matter, you should adore this too. What you will see is a serious take on the well-known ""Hansel and Gretel"" fairytale. The eerie atmopshere and unsettling feeling it envokes is unmatched. Practically every shot is like a high-art photograph (I think I took about 50+ screencaps because they were so stunningly framed/unique). I liken the style of aesthetic, pace and mood similar to that of ""The VVitch"", ""Hereditary"" and various other A24 released dark films (so if you liked those, give this one a go).

My ONLY complaint is that I felt the film would have been far better had it not strayed completely in it's own direction near the end (ie. they should have just followed the basic fairy tale storyline throughout) -- would have been EXTREMELY strong had they just kept going in that direction (even damn well perfect). Regardless, its still a GREAT watch and I recommend this to any dark arthouse fans. *********8.5/10 (would have been a 10 if it weren't for the point I mentioned above...). Enjoy!|, Can't wait to watch ""Matrix The"" in a few years.|, Just finished watching. So incredibly shot, frame by frame. Reminded me so much of the beauty of The Fall and The Cell from director Tarsem Singh. Likewise, a cinematic masterpiece. Adding in Alice Krige who I fell in love with ever since Ghost Story in the 80's, she is the mistress of ""creepy"" with little effort, just a slight smile or a glance can make anyone feel ""uneasy"".  I treasure anything she's been in...Borg Queen to this and everything in between...Delicious.|, One of the best horror movies I've ever seen
the cinematography was terrifyingly good and the sound and music was just soothing and unsettling|, This movie honestly looks really good.  The imagery is really cool and dark, can’t wait to see it.|, Hansel & Gretel is a very popular story that has been made into movies, books etc over the years. Search Hansel and Gretel anywhere and you have to sift through the results to find which version you are looking for. With the name change (which also makes sense considering the sister is older) people won’t have trouble finding this particular version. Years and years from now when more variations of the story are made on top of what already exists, this version will be super easy to find because of that title change. From a marketing standpoint it’s really smart.|, I wasn't expecting THAT much from this movie but it was actually a happy surprise. I like it very much it gives you the same vibes as The witch. Also the acting it's amazing!  
Ps: I guess that the rearrange in the title it's more like an empowering of Gretel that it's actually the main character and not her brother who turns out to be a little pain the ass. A humble and unpopular opinion here :) Go and watch it"
Groundhog Day,Groundhog Day (1993) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers,GncQtURdcE4,1507753,13371,800,"This movie has a deep meaning behind it. If you feel like everyday is the same, you might not be in the right direction.
It might get to the point of deep depression and sense of despair, but killing yourself is not the answer (Like in the movie).
Explore your passions, find the thing that genuinly fulfills you and stick to it, and also, a companion for the ride wouldn't hurt.|, It's strange how some films become classics. I remember going to see this at the cinema at the time it came out. I really enjoyed it, but I never thought for a minute it was going to become a classic on par with films like It's Wonderful life. I don't think anyone at the time did, it just kind of grow over time into an all time classic.|, I rarely say this but this is a truly masterpiece movie, 10 out of 10. I cant believe that I never heard of this movie before now.|, As time goes by, the sheer genius of this movie becomes more evident.
The best authors of their generations strive to touch the mysticism and existential relevance of this legendary human comedy.
A MASTERPIECE|, One of the most philosophical movies ever.  With a great meaning.|, Just finished watching this movie for the first time in years.

RIP Mark Elliot. Thanks for narrating this trailer for this iconic masterpiece.|, Excellent movie 👍👍👍👍🤭🤭🤭|, One of the most comforting, cozy, and funny movie I enjoy watching every time. It's usually my winter watching movie|, I watched this movie today for the first time. And i liked it very much. The message of this movie is clear and it is timely today about this still ongoing pandemic. If we are living in the same day everyday and we cannot do anything to change it, the only thing we can do is to CHANGE the WAY WE THINK about it. And then, every day, do something new that we haven't done yet no matter how small or simple it is and get some pleasure or joy out from it. Life must be lived in every moment, not only in every day."

I don’t care what anyone says, this movie is funny and it makes me think that we need more comedies.|, feel good movie, everything was fun and doesn't give you anxiety|, Man that looks like the greatest film ever - TWICE - I honestly can't recall a single second in the entire trailer that wasn't at least in the top 10 funniest comedy moments of all time, if not the top 5. I'm so glad they made a sequel - sometimes I wonder if the world would be a better, happier, funnier, sexier place if the all the financing and marketing for all other films was simply diverted to a constant stream of Grown-Ups films finishing with infinity. |, I love Adam Sandler. One of the best actor ever.|, Loved the first one

Certainly to be the best Christmas Day Present Ever!!|, I loved it. It's a fantastic movie. Don't care about the critics or what not. This movie was epic for my taste. Loved it. 10/10|, I like how this film is taking itself a bit seriously, where they could have easily just had a laugh. Essentially one of the things Deniro and Stallone have to overcome in this film is the critics who mock them, kind of like the people in the comments section saying they are desperate. This could actually turn out to be a really good film. Or it could be a total shit-fest, but I hope not. Won't know until it comes out|, This is like Rocky 7 and Raging Bull 2 at the same time! Can't wait to watch it! Hope it is good! |, This looks great. Who cares if they are old?  And Joey Diaz is in it so I'm not going to miss it.|, secretly rocky 7|, This film was f*cking amazing. I just watched it on a whim, after putting it off for years I finally gave it a shot. One of both Stallone & De Niro's best work. That frigging ending had me choked up.|, My mom honestly thought this was Rocky 7 and was like wait why did they change Paulie? Thankfully the real Rocky is coming back this year in Creed and even though he won't be fighting it's just nice to see the Rock again.|, Def a must see can't wait!!!

Even though it was only 3 years ago, those were some nice times.|, This trailer looks great! I'm sure the movie will be even better!|, One of my favorite scenes in the first GOTG movie is Rocket standing on Groot's shoulders, watching the two of them take on the prison.  It's such a cool reversal to see Groot standing on Rocket's shoulder, cheering him on, in this one.|, 5 years later and this is still one of the best marvel trailers ever|, The movie was SOO good you guys!

Vol 3: Brought seriousness when the MCU was trying to be comedy.|, I don’t normally cry at films but this was genuinely one of the saddest films I’ve ever seen. Everyone says Marvel just throws jokes into almost every sentence but they put all the heart into this movie. I’m genuinely not sure if I can ever bring myself to watch this film again. Well done James Gunn|, This movie was magical. I never thought I'd cry in a sci fi hero movie but the moment they saved ''regular'' animals I was in tears... Rocket is the best MCU character|, I couldn't hold back the tears every time I saw this trailer. After seeing the movie, it hits me even harder.

Hacksaw Ridge,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,s2-1hz1juBI,26881998,161089,12621,"boy am i glad i saw the movie before the trailer. they literally showed every single plotpoint.|, ""when everyone is taking life, I will be saving life"" was one of Desmond doss's quotes. Long live the legend.|, There’s a reason why Hacksaw Ridge is my favorite war movie and one of my favorite movies overall. One of the great things I love about war movies is that they contain life lessons that can be applied to real life. Hacksaw Ridge is a great example. Desmond Doss is literally my favorite veteran ever because of how he stuck to who he was while doing his part to serve his country. In an area where you’re expected to do what you’re told and carry a weapon, he held his feet and stuck to his beliefs. That’s the lesson of Hacksaw Ridge: never surrender your own personal values just to be like everybody else. This movie came out when I started high school and I was being peer pressured and bullied into getting drunk and smoking weed and sex and all that just for “the high school experience” as my peers said. That also carried on into college though it stopped now. But even through all of that I still held to my values of not drinking or smoking and no premarital sex and I can say that I absolutely love my college experience. And I hope this movie teaches others the same thing. Thank you Desmond Doss for your service and your convictions. Rest In Peace.|, Definitely one of the best movies ever! As a Seventh-day Adventist, I learned about Desmond Doss in eighth-grade history class at my Christian school, and I heard more about him in Christian college, but that didn't prepare me for the incredible, cinematic details of his story or ""God, help me save one more!"" Praise God for the miracles he worked through Desmond Doss!|, I love how this movie not only shows the physical damages of war such as lost limbs, high body counts, disease but also the mental damages that war does to you.|, That ""help me get one more"" line hits hard. Literally giving me goosebumps everytime ❤️😭 RIP to the real hero Desmond Doss you have a special place in heaven. 🙏❤️|, It was an absolute pleasure to work with Mel Gibson on this film. One of the all time great film directors and genuine nice bloke. Such a humble and honest worker who treats his crew like good friends. Rare to see at the pointy end of the film industry.|, This man needs more honor, Love, Attention. HE FOUGHT A WAR without a weapon and saved 75 people INCLUDING Japanese soldiers. HE WAS A TRUE HERO|, 2019, still brings a tear to my eye. This trailer. The film was captivating.|, I love this movie. I could watch it endlessly and never get sick of it. The emotion and raw truth it conveys to the viewer is outstanding. The first time I watched it I cried so hard, I even got anxiety and my fiance couldn't believe how badly I was shaking because of my PTSD, I felt like I was there with the men. This movie deserves so much more recognition not to mention this is based on a TRUE STORY. This is hands down one of mel Gibson's best movies. I know that not everyone may like him as a man but he makes absolutely outstanding movies. I can put my judgements aside and appreciate his pure talent as an artist."

Shahid Kapoor reminds me of Christian Bale, he has this dark, brooding depth in acting which is mesmerizing to watch. His Plaza scene was astounding! Sending all my love from the Philippines to all the cast and crew of Haider! 😍😘💖💖💖|, This movie is for literate people. Hope you guys know what i actually mean by that. This movie is a masterpiece.

"Hail, Caesar!","Hail, Caesar! - Official Trailer (HD)",kMqeoW3XRa0,11294376,24875,2163,"This movie is SO underrated.  Aside from the great story-telling and film structure that you'd expect from a CoenBros film, its parody of old movies and old Hollywood is so spot on that it's sure to delight fans of the era -- you will catch a dozen allusions in every scene.  Oh, and it's also hilarious.  Highly recommend.|, Just saw this.  Perfectly cast.  A jumble of elements that all fall into place principally through Brolin's character - he's really the center in terms of understanding the big theme here, which is one I get perfectly.  You feel overworked, stressed, unsure from the constant demands of your job  - roping in people, problems, crazy challenges, idiocies, betrayals, endless details...  You want to quit and find a door opens to an easy and lucrative opportunity, but... you know you'll never quit because you love the crazy - in this case Hollywood film making.  Josh Brolin plays this perfectly.  George Clooney is a brainless actor - also brilliantly done.  Everyone else has modest parts but they all add up:  the suits, the director (Fiennes) the religious folk, the communists, the cowboy, singers, dancers, bit part players, gossip columnists - all of them.  The film they are making, about ""The Christ"" suggests that insult to the Person or the event will occur, but it never does, and isn't meant to.  It nearly becomes saintly at the end (that faith scene here is the last one), but the Coen brothers' unique wit steps in before it gets either too noble or too mocking.  It's a well put together movie and I'll see it again.  Oh, see it on big screen while you can, by the way - there's a lot in the scenery you don't want to miss.|, It never fails.  I read about a Coen brothers film that is in the works, and I wonder ""How can a movie about that possibly be any good?""  Then I see the trailer (or the film) and I suddenly understand.  The Coens are genius filmmakers.  They start with the ordinary and create the extraordinary.|, I love this movie. People who complain about its plot would probably prefer the usual story about a spotless hero who defeats the villain. There were many memorable scenes I rewatched more than once on youtube. 
In my opinion, this movie is almost as good as the Big Lebowski.|, A brilliant trailer to a brilliant movie. I still come back to it once in a while. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Easily one of my fav movies.|, Clever, subtle, fresh and amazingly satirical, this movie was a gem in the shitstorm of january and february. Coen brothers do not disappoint and again it is another jab at life , rich, regimes and all other everyday topics. Performances are phenomenal, especially Clooney who plays Baird Whitlock , somehow a movie studio tool without brain of its own. Screenplay is wonderful , you could nominate production design, make up and costumes for oscars if you want, and in the end while it is not meant to be taken seriously people could really pickup again subtle message this movie sends. Go see it . 4/5|, George Clooney and the Coen Brothers are always bound for greatness whenever they make movies together.|, The way Brolin runs away at 1:50 makes me laugh every time.|, I loved this movie so much. One of my favourites of that year.|, The film was crazy boring, but there's just something about it that endears me so much. The style, the colours, the cinematography... it's all so charming. And the characters are extremely lovable."
Halloween,This Is Halloween (From Tim Burton&#39;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;),ZVuToMilP0A,38431634,293145,6275,"I just love the fact that ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" can be a Halloween movie and a Christmas movie :)|, Some movies are so timeless that you remember them forever. This is definitely one of them.|, This song never gets old. One of my favorite films since I was a kid.

Happy Halloween 2023! 💀😈👻🎃|, Happy 30th anniversary to the movie and Happy Halloween|, I waited 365 days to hear this…on repeat all October!!|, 2:49-3:00 As great as this whole song is, this is easily the best part

The grand finale of Jack rising up to a standing ovation and the La! La! La! from the monsters was so intense|, I love how unapologetically macabre the characters look, like, I imagine Disney looking at them thinking ""Isn't this supposed to be for kids?""
Charming.|, The tradition continues, Happy Halloween! 🎃|, In all seriousness, this is a fantastic movie. It has stood the test of time so well, love the story, authenticity, art direction, music, visuals, and voice acting performances! And I genuinely believe it gets better the older you get!|, Welcome back everyone! Happy Halloween 🎃"
Halloween Ends,Halloween Ends (2022) - Laurie Kills Michael Scene | Movieclips,XzPF6DNqr4o,691276,6769,1375,"I think what people are forgetting is Michael is simply the vessel of evil. And this vessel has been through a lot and was dying. The only thing that was keeping him alive was his pursuit of Laurie. Remember what Laurie writes at the end of her story ""Evil never really dies, it just changes shape.""|, I'm happy with this ending since she removed Michael's mask this time , so no paramedic clothes switch bs. And she tossed his body in the shredder, so no eyes opening bs.  A truly definitive end|, Micheal truly was a vessel for evil. Yes, he was a man, but like Laurie said, "" but a man could not have survived that fire."" The more he kills, the more tresacends into something that's evil. Evil took hold of him for years, but his fight with Laurie was coming full ahead. I absolutely loved how they showed her past youth where he's haunted her and robbed her of her life for years. FINALLY, micheals time comes to an end.|, This whole fight scene was great and I love that after everything that happened she decided to give Michael a quite death of bleeding out and even held his hand for his last breath.|, Michael went out like a punk here. He's the shape of evil and he lost after being pinned down by 2 knives and a refrigerator. They should've made the fight last longer, they should've had Michael at 70% power, and they should've gave him more screen time than Corey.|, This was the last epic fight of 44 Years of hate and anger speaking. Laurie was physically confronted for the last time by the trauma that had taken away her youth. Michael was definitely aware of Laurie and he hasn't forgotten her since 1978. The fact that he wants to grind his hand shows that he has not forgotten her since the events of 2018. An absolutely clean, on point and respectable ending to the trilogy.|, This scene alone pretty much confirms my theory that Laurie and Michael do not like each other.
 It's subtly hinted at throughout the other movies and 40 + years, but this scene alone confirms my suspicion.|, This scene was so iconic for me. The way Laurie knew that she dosen't need more than 20 people to try and kill Michael, but it's so sad that this is the end...😥😭|, I love the change of musical score and Laurie saying. ""Do it. DO IT!"" at 2:30 its so fitting|, As horrible the movie was, this scene had me at the edge of my seat. Props to Jamie Lee Curtis for her outstanding performances throughout the franchise. The biggest issue I had with Halloween Ends is MICHAEL DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH SCREEN TIME"
Halloween Kills,Halloween Kills (2021) - Michael Myers vs. Firefighters Scene (1/10) | Movieclips,KxMMYKkVbwA,3014556,34712,3879,"The firefighters knew what was coming. Rather than running away, they stood their ground and went down swinging. Respect.|, People can say what they want about this film, but this was one of the best scenes in the entire franchise. Michael emerging from a burning wreckage was badass. He was definitely the best part of this film.|, The fact that the hose didn’t push Michael back or stop him in his tracks is just bone chilling. Every fire fighter knows the amount of PSI that a fire hose can release is enough to knock down a human being.|, As a junior firefighter, I’d say this scene is just amazing, the firemen were at least trying to fight Micheal with their tools like the K12 saw and an axe, when I saw Micheal Myers grab the Haligan, I was in shock just to see Myers killing the firemen with the haligan|, Only a few realize how strong Michael is when he walked through that water hose. If you know you know|, Dude went from Killing Firefighters and the Town’s neighborhood to letting a random guy take his mask off smh…|, Seeing the firefighters ready themselves for the fight gives me chills every time!!!|, Firefighters just watched the embodiment of evil walk out of a burning house and decided to square up. Doesn't get much more badass than that.|, “There’s someone else down here!” as the theme starts playing gave me chills the first time. I just love the idea of these men having to run into hell on earth on a daily basis not knowing theres something far worse waiting for them this time|, I like how as soon as Michael came out of the house the firefighters understood the assignment."

     The duel 02:15:06|, Superb production in every way. We can all very much appreciate the great acting on display here but no one ever mentions the great camerawork by Desmond Dickinson --- it lent a moody, atmospheric and experimental tone to the film, a feeling akin to the work done by Gregg Toland on _Citizen Kane_ seven years earlier --- which, like this film, had a _film noir_ sensibility. Dickinson's moody atmospherics were also memorably on display 12 years later in the cult classic _City of the Dead (aka Horror Hotel)._ In my opinion, this is the best film version of Hamlet --- quite memorable.|, Wonderfully done! Shakespeare never goes out of style|, I can't think about Hamlet without thinking of Sir Laurence  Olivier. What an actor!  And not forgetting all the actors of this movie: all of them are sublime!|, Don't you all respect the actor who plays the king? What a wonderful voice. Pure Shakespeare!|, Thank you for sharing this.
Olivier’s leap from the balcony at 02:26:09 always amazes me.|, One of the greatest pieces of English literature in combination with one of the most sublime dramatic expression by actresses and actors. I cannot help but think Hamlet was a real person.|, He did the play upon the stage as well. How brilliant he was! 👏

As Shakespeare is the Touchstone for acting abilities, so too, Olivier is the measurement of both man and artist.

Missing a few acts in this movie probably due to sensorship and lack of timing. I loved how they all bowed to Hamlet in the end as he was instantly King of Denmark for a few minutes before he succumbed to the poison.|, ""Go on, I follow thee."" He turns his sword to point down. Magnificent. A good person simply can't win. If you don't seek revenge, evil controls. If you seek revenge, evil controls. A mere human cannot win.|, Wow. Looks Incredible.

It's not like the weapons, accents and costumes are the least believable things! It's not meant to be a clever film, it's meant to be an enjoyable one, which it is. The acting is good, the fight scenes are well choreographed and the plot is engaging. Stop worrying about whether or not fairytales are realistic!|, i watched this movie 10 times in a row and i dont get bored of it.|, I actually really liked the film.|, Great movie. Watched it on Netflix with my friends last night, and it was amazing. Loved every second of it.|, this would make a really sick video game|, applause for the makeup artist they killed it 👍👍|, Wow, this movie is so exciting and good. Don't listen to those critics!|, I personally loved this film! Even though the pacing can be strange and several devices were not essential to the plot, I really liked the twist on a classic fairy tale. The critics may deem the movie unworthy in artistic values, but I think it's a good entertainment piece.|, Just watched this a second time and it never disappoints! Love this movie"
Happy Death Day,Happy Death Day Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Trailers,1NTaDm3atkc,8125184,56404,5372,"I wasn't initially sold by this trailer, but I gave the movie a shot and ended up absolutely loving it.  Really fun, entertaining movie with an engaging lead and a clever riff on the time-loop/Groundhog Day formula.  I was practically first in line to see the sequel-- which I also loved for both continuing the story while also changing things up.  (I loved how the second movie was more of an overt sci-fi comedy.  It was a fun way to evolve the franchise.)  Here's to hoping that eventually they get to make the third movie.|, I actually really loved this movie!! Very unexpected twist. I was actually shocked.|, I’ve never commented on YouTube about a movie before, but this one deserves it. I love that this is a psychological horror with no jump scares. Beautifully filmed with a cool atmosphere. If anybody is looking at these comments before watching, YOU MUST GIVE IT A WATCH. Amazing film 🔥|, I knew I’d probably like this movie, but it was a lot better then I’d thought it’d be! A great mixture of horror & comedy! Some really cool twists! The character development for Tree was really well-executed. You hated her at first, but then you grow to care for her. Really clever film overall!|, this is shockingly one of my favorite movies of all time I think. has a positive message, lots of good kills, good horror, great comedy, etc. The sequel gives you all of that plus some sci-fi too. they're apparently working on a 3rd movie too. I have to recommend this movie to everyone|, one of the most gripping movie ive ever watched. very well directed and screen play, character leveling everything is awesome. 10/10. recommended.|, she should have helped stop global warming|, Ótimo filme,super criativo, ótimas atuações,para mim o filme é dez.|, Such a good movie if you like timeloops, it has fun with the idea much like Groundhog Day does, with the character loosing their grip on reality and desperately trying to solve their murder any means necessary. Definitely recommend it, now it's out on DVD/Blu-ray.|, Loved this movie! And the 2nd one was great too! When her mom appeared I cried 😭😭😭"
Happy Death Day 2U,Happy Death Day 2U Trailer #1 (2019) | Movieclips Trailers,THq6KlWgiqw,7092467,76369,6527,"I'm convinced that Jessica Rothe would make an amazing Lady Deadpool if the chance ever came up.|, This movie has a deep meaning behind it. if you feel like everyday is the same,you  might not be in the right direction. It might get to the point of deep depression and sense of despair,but killing yourself or your time might not be answer.
Explore your passion, new possibilities and find things that genuinely fulfills you and stick to it and also a compassion for ride doesn't hurt|, I died 11 times

“You think your life sucks? I wear size 13 Nike’s in men! Beat that!”|, I just watched this movie series for the first time tonight, and I couldn't stop laughing.  I think I might have woken some people up in my house.  What a surprise hit, with the 1st movie being absolutely hilarious, and then the 2nd film pushing that even further and adding in an even more insane plot.  The cast has natural chemistry and Jessica Rothe has the comedic nuances of Deadpool.  The director/writers delivered another fantastic surprise with the sequel.|, I’ve seen this movie a bunch of times and I love it. I’ve always thought that it was a risky move having her live the same day over and over again in the sequel and not staying with the friend going through it (like it was at the beginning of the film) because people might have accused it of using the same exact idea twice, but I honestly think it saved the movie as the friend’s character really just wasn’t interesting enough.|, It's such a good sequel. People need to ignore the ratings. I love when a movie gives you more and more which makes the story better instead of unnecessary thing and when it is well-rounded. This and the first installment are such examples. Like The Babysitter and IT too. You feel like it might be ending but wait...there's more!|, Happy Death Day took me by complete surprise by how much fun it was.  I've watched it so many times by now, and I'm actually surprised that the all the characters seem to be coming back for the sequel, which isn't done very often in horror movies.  Normally when original characters return, they're killed off within the first few minutes of the sequel and are replaced by new characters. Happy Death Day has the potential to be as great as the Scream series if they manage to keep a consistent cast and create some really good lore for the universe they're creating.  I hope they manage to fulfill that potential.|, I LOVE the fact they have gone for the loop of the same day. It just shows their creativity to bring different story within the same conditions. I enjoyed the first one, have not seen a franchise which combines horror particles with comedy potential. Second one looks even better, hopefully it does at least as good as the first one.|, I think the scariest part about this is she has to relive a day in school without a weekend|, I've just seen it and I was blown away. Just like the first movie, it's a gripping mystery with a (dark) comedic tone and - surprisingly - some emotional moments as well such as when Tree faces moral dilemmas or bids farewell to loved ones she knows she will lose. We root for Tree and her friends during their whole ordeal. This is exactly my kind of cinematic treat: a fun, smart and uplifting (yes, I mean it, uplifting) movie  👍👏😉😃
Kudos for turning out such a brilliant sequel such a short time after the first installment!"

It perfectly portrays how a child develop multiple personality disorder or how pressure affects a child. TLC i critical for a child growth and development if you really interpret it in the aspect of mental health concern.|, Just finished watching this. 10/10 Perfect story line. No dull moments. I highly recommend this.|, Awesome movie. I struggle to find new movies to watch, because I like original and more thought provoking films, especially when it comes to horror. This one definitely delivered. I can see it being an acquired taste, because it's not that much like a regular horror movie, but if you watch it from the perspective of social commentary and the symbolism of it, it's pretty damn awesome.|, Quite good, yes quite good! The young actress is wonderful, and the woman who plays the mother does a thoroughly convincing job of being a self-absorbed, miserable witch. A story about a kind soul dealing with the lesser forms of life....her mother.|, The best film in a while. If not ever. Deeply emotional metaphorical film about the way we raise children influences the way they are. Social commentary for the life behind a blog is also present. Truly impressive and shocking. But a true masterpiece.|, Controlling, overbearing parents can certainly Hatch resentment, anger and vengefulness in children... A brilliant horror, beautifully shot and superbly acted!|, I watched this in theaters two days ago and my gosh this is a sleeper hit! If your local theater is playing it definitely check it out! :D|, I'm so down for this. Unique and interesting! I love it!"

Malala is an absolute incredible braveheart, but it takes the greatest possible deal of courage to watch your daughter be hospitalised after being shot in the head, to watch her lay in a coma, not knowing if she would ever fully recover, and to let her go, once again, and fight for the same justice that she was (unsuccessfully) silenced for. That entire family is just a blossoming flower of inspiration because they chose not to clip her wings.|, No matter what religion or man or woman she deserves so much respect |, I don't see how *anybody* could possibly have any disrespect for this incredible young woman. She is a courageous, bold, and inspirational human being. I have all the respect in the world for her.|, I never cry at movies but this is the only movie ever that made me cry my eyes out, absolutely incredible. What a Brave woman who spoke out against injustice during such oppression. Only very few people could do what she has done|, This girl is so inspirational to me. Her speeches always give me goosebumps. I stand with her on her beliefs. Everyone deserves the right to education and every woman deserves respect, the right to do, say, feel, think what she wants, dress how she wants, to be free. These extremists who are scared of women and treat them like crap will be defeated one day. i hope that all women are respected, valued, honoured and are seen ad equal by all men one day. Honour your daughters, they are honourable.|, I'm 10 minutes into the movie and I already have tears in My eyes. Brave girl|, How anyone can say something hateful about this beautiful person is beyond me.Im so proud of Malala , she stands up for basic human rights , she is light in so much darkness . Allah saved her for a reason to carry on with her message of equality for girls to be able to get an education. May Allah always protect her Ameen !!❤️|, I'm the same age as Malala, but I feel like she is an eternity wiser than me.
*So* much respect for her. So much.|, I love this girl! She's truly an inspiration to all especially to those girls denied of their rights to education or their human rights in general.|, Gave me goosebumps. ✨✨🔥 Proud to be born as a girl. Awesome trailer. Girls like her are leaders. 👑👑👑"

Every time I listen to this I wish I was up there with him.|, No matter how many years pass, this song will stay in our hearts forever!.💖|, I recently celebrated my 1 year anniversary with my wife, and this song struck me tonight. I wanted to wish that everyone one out there finds someone who they feel this way about. Especially with how the world feels right now. I wish everyone the best and if you have some one special in your life, I wish you the happiest time together and create the best of life. Finally thank you kindly Mr Brown for this song.

Heaven Knows What,HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT - Official Red Band Trailer,zxWMc7iHt8Q,687649,5285,468,"The reason it's so well-done and spot-on with the lingo and everything concerning drugs and addiction is because the movie is based off of Arielle Holmes' life from when she was addicted to drugs. She plays a version of herself as Harley, and I applaud her for having the courage to do this, and to show what addiction is truly like. It's not easy and full of sunshine and rainbows like some Hollywood films have made it out to be. Kudos to Arielle Holmes, Caleb Landry Jones (who is a favorite actor of mine), and the entire cast and crew for bringing the TRUE reality of addiction to the screens. I only wish it was playing in my city.|, Most realistic depiction of heroin addiction I've ever seen in a movie by far. Everything is absolutely spot on. Amazing film.|, Safdie Brothers slowly becoming legendary 21st century filmmakers while we witness the transformation.|, Even though I hate being a junkie, I love to see the culture of addicts portrayed in a realistic way|, Just a little note to everyone talking about your sobriety: I'm so incredibly proud of you. You're warriors and heroes. Addiction is a bitch, beating that is incredible! 
And to the people who are still working on getting clean, I'm also proud of you! You're taking the steps you need to to get better and that's amazing! I know it's not easy, but I promise you're doing so well. 
I hope you've found peace. Never forget how strong you are. If you ever need to talk, I'm more than happy to listen. I'm so proud of you.|, I love caleb as actor but holy,this is one of my favorite films,probably cause of how raw and real it is..and how I am almost a decade sober and how hard it hits on that level. *hats off and claps to ariel for coming through such a journey*|, Most realistic movie I've ever seen, hands down. 

Realer then real.|, I've only just come across this movie!! Where the hell have I been? The film is gritty, it's factual and it's real!! This is a must watch movie no matter what part of society you think you're from. I felt so passionate about the life of ""Harley"" and I really wanted to kick Ilya's sorry ass!! This girls love was so unconditional yet he takes it for granted and treats her like she doesnt mean anything.... Hats off to Arielle Holmes for thrusting this into the face of those who's reality revolves around themselves and suburbia!! This is reality! This is a wake up call.... don't judge without reason.... love is love no matter what, where or who!! Circumstances and good or bad choices create situations and do not define people!! Arielle, oh if only I were younger ha, ha, cute, well yeah I guess lol. Good luck with your future........|, So grateful I don't have to start my day by stressing out over what shady shit I'm gonna need to do to get a few bags. Shit was fine and dandy when I could afford stacks, but that doesn't last long.  11/21/2017 was the last bottom and a bottom it was...My final wake up call was a DCF investigation. I was in detox and a bunch of cops showed to my moms late at night to do a welfare check on my daughter who was 3 at the time. Shit got real when my mom told me. I said I'd do whatever it took to not lose my daughter. It gets better, not overnight, but now I have my own place, a good job, nice car, etc. Nothings perfect and I still have so much to work on, but I'm living a life and being the best mom.|, I don't think I could ever watch this movie because drugs freak me the fuck out but the trailer looks so well done.  Amazing editing.  "

An amazing movie. For anyone at a crossroads in your life, this will touch you deeply.|, This movie is amazing. If you notice, now in days bad movies get good reviews, while good movies get bad reviews. I loved this movie.|, Simon Pegg is probably my third favorite actor on the planet.  Not just because he has a permanently reserved ticket direct to my funny bone, but because of the ease at which he touches my heart in whatever role he plays.  
This movie was utterly fantastic.  I took this almost two hour ride with him and will never regret it.  It taught me a lot about happiness and the pursuit of it (the journey) for which I've am very grateful.  I've only been truly happy as a poor child growing up in Memphis.  We had nothing but things were so much more simple then and happiness was literally free.  
I highly recommend this movie and the accompanying popcorn, soda, and someone or something to cuddle up with you when you watch it.  This world needs more movies with Simon Pegg in them.  Cheers!|, ill say this is a really humane and inspiring movie for people at a certain stage. Especially when you know how to appreciate things more|, This movie is freaking brilliant! Don't let the bad reviews stop you from watching this. You will not be disappointed!|, Found out about this because I love Simon Pegg. I was absolutely captivated with this film. I'm really surprised like the others here that this film got negative reviews. In my opinion it is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It has everything you want; great story, affable characters, soul searching, top notch cast, lovely soundtrack. It's a movie that'll leave an impression on you, making you to think and reflect on your own life. No there aren't any folding walls, explosions, and robots. This is movie about humanity. Don't let it's accessibility fool you. It's one that I own and will be watching again!|, Don't listen to the critics telling everyone this movie sucked because it's faaaaaaar from that. I loved this movie so much, it was so uplifting, and through out the whole thing I felt everything the actors and actresses were feeling, I recommended it to all my friends after watching. This might actually be one of my all time favorites!|, At the end of ""it all,"" happiness is knowing that you've done good (to give more) for either your world, your people, your lover, yourself, or your kids. It's to wholeheartedly believe that you did something that you believe is right. Previous generations never had to think any farther than that to be what is known as ""happy."""
Hell Fest,Hell Fest (2018 Movie) Official Trailer,olBLvQ26_eM,466770,3297,210,"I can not believe that they have not made a sequel yet! Excellent film 🎥 and great actors/effects!|, Since the Halloween movies came out I have been patiently awaiting a sequel to Hell Fest.  I think the stories would be similar to what John Carpenter wanted the Halloween franchise to turn out.  Have eventually a different killer emerge every 2 or 3 movies.  I would be exicited if they made the killers different.  Like one who goes just for women and one just for men and some who hunt in a pack.  That was what kept made me watch Criminal Minds and SVU.  How many differnt crazed killers are there?|, Wow a horror movie people seem to like! I’m excited to watch it. Seems like a good idea for a film. I always thought they should make one like this|, This was a surprisingly good horror movie. Loved it.|, This is a really good movie.  I recomend it for people who want to be scared.|, Can't wait to watch this again for Halloween 🎃🍂🍁|, Watching this movie now and it is really good. It is so creepy and terrifying that my poor dachshund dog left my side to hide under cover at the foot of bed and he never leaves my side until this movie LoL. 😱😨|, I did the Great Horror Campout in real life... I was legit concerned about this possibility haha. I will see this movie! :)|, I saw this trailer in an AT&T store when I was 8. This terrified the absolute heck out of me|, Reminded me of Escape Room in turns of production value because it was very detailed and creepy and cool visually to watch. Like so many creepy things to look at while watching. But, that ending was most shocking of all! I didn't see it coming! Makes me wonder if a part of it was based on true events. Wouldn't surprise me."
Hell or High Water,HELL OR HIGH WATER - Official Trailer HD,JQoqsKoJVDw,7303423,17709,1276,"This is the best movie I've seen in quite some time. Amazing acting, humor, action, plot, and 98% realistic. I hope this gets the attention it deserves.|, As others have said here, the best movie I've seen in a long time. A story told straight and true, with no Hollywood histrionics or sentimentality.  Fantastic film, wonderfully acted and directed.  There are just not enough superlatives to adequately convey the greatness of this film.|, Just finished watching. This movie is a masterpiece! 
Great plot, great acting, beautiful visuals, makes sense the whole way through. Loved it!|, One of the best film in the crime/thriller genre. After ""No country for old men"", this one is definitely a good watch. 
A simple story line, yet so impressively portrayed. The acting of the cast was top notch, which makes this a must watch.|, Incredible movie with all of the elements that make a truly great masterpiece of a film— acting, love, humor, real-life, you can relate to the feelings of the characters. Just a real gem|, Absolute Gem of a movie, great acting and brilliant humour,Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges are hugely entertaining|, One of the best movies of the year for sure. Every actor was electric but Ben Foster really took it entirely to a new level.|, Hell or High Water is a critics favorite this year, and understandably so. This is a very well made movie from direction to cinematography, to dialogue and acting. The actors all around, from supporting to major characters add depth and substance to what could have been overly slow parts, but make it work. The movie belongs to Jeff Bridges as the soon to retire Texas Ranger. He brings that Bridges screen presence that makes it impossible to look away, and he's gone the extra mile for this character. If he does not get an Oscar nomination for this one, I'd be very surprised. 

Many of the characters get overly close to wooden caricatures at times, but the actors, dialogue and director veer away from it just in time in most cases. A tad more character development wouldn't have hurt for the viewers connections to them, but what we do get, works well. The movie is a bit heavy handed and overly simplistic on the Robin Hood, Jesse James  theme and some misplaced blame on evil bank for all their problems, but that's understandable from the characters POV perhaps. The movie makes it seem everyone in that part of TX may not always have food, but they always have plenty of guns... Because this movie came from the same writer of Sicario I had very high hopes for Hell Or High Water, and while it didn't disappoint, it's no Sicario in my view. Still highly recommended A-|, This movie was amazing. Nothing groundbreaking but every scene was so well done and every actor was on point. A modern western in all his glory.|, This may seem like a small movie that you may dismiss or might not like because of the trailer, but this movie is anything but small. You are kept on the edge of you seat the entire movie, even through the ""boring"" one-on-one conversations. It isn't jammed packed with action scenes like most summer films  and its not a remake or a sequel. Best film of the year by far."

He had been wanting to do a 3rd Hellboy since the 2nd was over, and he was perfect in the role.|, 32:59 - I especially like this part, where his rock hand switches from his right hand to his left for a few seconds.|, I have to admit, I really enjoyed this movie! After having seen the 1st two, I didn't expect it to be so good 👍.|, Still a better story than Twilight|, I love being subscribed to this channel. I havent seen this movie in a looooong time.  Its so fantastic !|, Hellboy has Been My Favourite Superhero Since I was a Kid.

I remember the First time my Uncle Introduced me to Hellboy. We seen 2004-08 Movies & Animated Movies, too. 
The 2019 Movie is Alright. I like it. It’s not that Bad.

Hellboy is My Favourite Superhero, Outside DC/Marvel.|, Merlin is restored and continues on without missing a beat 😂no questions asked|, Decent enough film! I definitely don't think it deserves all the hate it got! I genuinely enjoyed the giant devils as they were scary and the fact it didn't shy away from the gore was appreciated. I liked David Harbour, but the way he spoke is what took it away from me the most. If he just articulated more than slurred his speech, then it would have been much better!|, Fantastic! Love Everything about it! The music, the wit, Awesomeness|, This Hellboy gives me Andre the Giant vibes, just better able to speak."

Какой дуэт, просто супер!!!|, Это просто шедевр, смотрела в детстве ни слова не понятно, но магия сработалая их обожаю голоса и музыка|, They don’t make them like this anymore! She’s beautiful! And that voice! No auto tune there!❤|, Просто мороз по коже при одной мысли какие это легенды, золотой фонд .|, Contrarly to popular opinion I think no one comes close to Barbra’s interpretation of this song. She brought something singularly personal and original to the song.|, She might have been very young for the role , but in my opinion she was the best cast for this role ! She played it to perfection ! My favorite musical of all time !|, This is outstanding. They sound SOOOO amazing together. I wish they'd recorded more tunes together.|, Barbra’s gold lame gown showcased her hourglass figure, so popular in the 1880’s to perfection. Her voice and acting in this production are incomparable. Louis Armstrong what can be said? Marvelous!|, I love Barbra's voice because it is very clear and on the note."

Glad to see this is getting some social treatment. Love knows few boundaries.|, All I need is a sequel ❤
Can't get enough of this movie.|, Great performances by all the actors but Sally FIeld what can I say she is truly a legend! the sadness and depth of her down fall for this younger man was just heartbreaking, we all have been in her shoes before! The funny bits are down hilarious!  family and friendship issues are so on point! highly recommend this movie!|, Sally Field should have won an Oscar for this.  The film is smart, sensitive, funny, insightful, and very entertaining!|, Sally Fields is always worth watching, so good to see her on the big screen again, a touching and funny film.|, This movie was so good.  Made me laugh, and also a bit sad - but sweet and then funny again.  Great acting and writing!|, This movie is really touching, *SPOILERS*loved especially her meltdown when they tried to move her stuff from her house, her talent (Sally's)shone and left all spectators silent after so many laughs we had had till that moment.|, I watched this movie knowing nothing about it except that Sally Field was in it. I was pleasantly surprised, it was a fun, cute movie. We watch Doris make one bad decision after another but we can't help but still root for her.|, This movie was utterly charming!  The actors had such great chemistry together--Sally Field and Max Greenfield, but also Tyne Daly and Isabella Acres who play Doris' best friend and granddaughter respectively.  The movie is about so much more than just dating a younger man and one of the details I loved is that the jokes would have worked if the roles had been reversed (younger woman/older man) or even if they were both the same age, which I think gives it a nice depth."

It's not so much the watching it that gets you, it's the _idea_ of it.|, I love theses types of movies. They aren’t necessarily “scary” but they fill you with dread and anxiety. It’s not always easy to get that effect but they did an amazing job|, I was watching this with my friends. There was this moment when the son is waking up and just sits in bed. And then suddenly my friend screamed ""SHIT!!! SHE'S ON THE ROOF"". And then, realizing that there was someone hanging in the roof all along just electrified my whole body. This is what true horror feels like, things that are hidden at plain sight|, This has to be one of the best trailers I’ve ever seen in my life. It sets up the movie perfectly without spoiling anything, and still gives off an incredibly eerie vibe!|, This movie still haunts me and gives me goosebumps even  when i think about it. I know that most of you disagree with me but imo Hereditary is the best horror movie ever.|, This truly is one of the most original movies I've ever watched. 
And for anyone wondering, this is MUCH more than just your typical horror movie. While in a way it definitely is a horror, it's so much more, as even Toni said in Now This News interview.
Also, her performance in this was just amazing, it was pure art. Raw emotion in every single scene she's in. This movie has so many great scenes in it, overall.
Definitely worth a watch.|, This is one of the best horror movies movies I've ever seen. It's gory and scary, but it's also *extremely* smart, twisty, and brilliantly acted. I wish it would get the attention it deserves.|, This is LITERALLY one of the GREATEST horror movies of all time!!! Such great writing & acting!! The ending f'ed w me a bit, but it was amazing!!|, An absolute masterpiece in filmmaking and cerebral horror. Gets under your skin and will have you talking about it long after watching it. The kind of movie loaded with details missed with just one viewing, it gets better and better and the rewatch value is incredibly high with new things picked up with every viewing. A passion project for a true fan of the horror genre if there ever was one, and this is it. Ari Aster has the gift.|, I watched this film shortly after its release, and I still can’t get it out of my head, damn it lol. I was emotionally broken by this movie. I was terrified to rewatch it, but I had to expose my friends/family because it’s a masterpiece. I’m in love with off-beat, disturbing horror that is well-acted and shot beautifully. Nothing I’ve ever seen compares to this film. And then for Aster to follow it up with Midsommar, which had me ALMOST as obsessed. Please please recommend me horror films on this level if they exist."

Brilliant..|, Predicting the trajectory through math is insanely amazing alone, but pointing out to the map where he could possibly land is madly genius. Katherine is a legend that's for sure. Wow, im always amaze how math works in every aspects of our life. Numbers are magical.|, Katherine was my Aunt... everytime I see this movie I'm so proud to have grown up with her :)|, I love his face at 1:10. You can see he wants to be angry but he's impressed. He knows she's the real deal and he probably feels like an idiot for trying to keep her out of the meetings too 😂|, It took a lot of courage to step up to the plate and do that calculation in front of the NASA board elite, knowing she wasn’t accepted by her peers. That’s why this movie is so inspiring.|, I love that movie and have watched it several times. I'm glad these excellent women finally got some of the recognition they deserved - although way too late. How they figured all that stuff out with ""math that doesn't exist yet"" is beyond me.|, what a powerful moment in the movie and history. true merit regardless of creed, gender, race shines through.  truly pivotal scene. love this movie. watched this movie with my two daughters that inspired them to choose STEM careers.|, I grew up during the space race, following all of it for years. It really angered me that  I had to learn about these women's accomplishments from a movie so long after the fact. Shame on NASA for leaving them in the shadows.|, I work in a math science building at a university here in the U.S., (cleaning) and it floors me to see how folks can know this subject as easily as breathing, the way this character does.

I loved how it was shown that Zander was in tears. He wasn't jealous or had any negative emotion but he was in awe of how magical the performance was .. the music, the dance, his choreo .. it showed what matters most to him is his passion for choreography .. his choreo being executed as or beyond his expectations, it touched him. And then there were two (and moree, everyone honestly) other beautiful souls shown so magically performing, with all their emotions bare .. and passion is written all over them too! In Charlie's music, Barlow's dance, in their unexpected last scene and the kiss. The movie was more about talents, artists, and their passion rather than a love triangle, which I loved the most. The whole movie was magical! 😌👏|, This was a phenomenal movie, from the story line to the cast, it was so epic. I especially enjoyed the music and dancing. The dancers were so great. All the actors did a phenomenal job. I just wish it was longer.|, I loved the choreography. Amazing!! I don’t cry at all during movies no matter what it is. But this movie left me so emotional at the end, I don’t know why!  I loved the relationship between the young kid and the elderly lady, very sweet. Beautiful and moving. I’ve seen it four times now and still get emotional, wow!|, This film, these actors, dancers and incredibly beautiful people have given me a new understanding of the words rapture, splendour and joy. Thank you. Especially to Thomas and Juliet. Such intensity! Thank you for giving me a wonderful, powerful and moving experience that I will cherish for the rest of my days. ❤️|, Amazing soundtrack
Amazing performance
That moment when he reached for her was simply breathtaking...time stood still ❤|, The girl lead was very good, just found out she’s a dancer and not really an actress but her acting was so good. I really hope I can see her in other movies again in the future, I hope she won’t stop pursuing her acting career because she really is something❤️❤️ I really adore her, she’s phenomenal😍|, Most beautiful melodies and fantastic talent!

Loved the story, the building, the metaphors between architecture and how society works. Completely amazing!!|, This adaptation looks genuinely amazing and hearing actual lines from the book is soooo satisfying :)|, This film is genius. It hurts to see how many people don't like it but i can understand. You really have to think about this film for it to make sense which is hard and disturbing because you feel like you are going insane in the first 10 minutes.  It's absurd and grotesque and fast and slow at the same time and i think it's the perfect example for needing to rewatch a film for a few times because you will notice something new everytime and either it will make more sense or less but it's really interesting. It also shows human nature and society in a very raw way. Chasing pleasures to the level when there is no more satisfaction.|, I kid you not, Tom Hiddleston - could very well be the next James Bond.|, My interest in this movie is really towering.
You could say I have high hopes for it.|, Everyone should read the book...mind blowing read.|, I just watched the movie and this is amazing...a masterpiece. Jeremy, Luke and Tom did a marvelous job with their characters.

Every hiddlestoners should specially watch the movie. It is going to keep you on edge of your seat. 😅|, Such a gooooood film! I first became aware of the production a year before release, when I discovered Ben Wheatley was attached to the project. Having watched a number of his other films, I knew this would be something special. Then I became aware of the all-star cast involved, and I was sold. It was better than I thought - surrealist direction, thought-provoking cinematography, intelligent writing and compelling performances made this a cinema experience that will be difficult to forget. 10/10|, Dang, this man did a 6 and a half hour audio book AND stared in the movie for this story. OMG he is perfect!!! (I highly recommend his audio book. his voice is so nice. It helps me fall asleep then I wake up to toms voice. I LOVE IT)|, This was a fucking awesome film.

The gripping suspense and use of soundtrack was nothing less than phenomenal. Definitely one of the best lesser known films released for many a year. Bravo."

Now I understand the parallel between Abraham and God's only son. It has now become the epitome of love and sacrifice in my walk of faith.|, As a father of an only child myself,  a son,  I truly can relate. I too would cry out ""take me"".
It costs more, causes the deepest pain than to offer our own lives. It breaks you, goes to the ultimate one can sustain in himself.

I think this director has a bright future and we're looking forward to his future faith-based projects. To think that this was done on a budget of under $250,000 is mind-blowing when you see how well it is put together. Highly recommend.|, There are so many powerful stories to be told on the big screen from His Word.|, Saw this last evening.  In the last quarter, couldn't hold back the tears.  Reason: my personal experiences and seeing the reality of God's call to Abraham. Those called for greatest purposes often have the most difficult trials, a breaking and reshaping.  So it was with this man, the Father of Faith.  Also, Sarah was extraordinary.  The pain of her soul lasted longer than our lifetimes, but she made it through and was rewarded for it.  Can God use us like this?|, I just watched this movie. It's so good it made me cry so much! I don't even remember when was the last time I cried in a movie theater.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, these three work so well together|, Salma Hayek at 50 can still give any other actress a run for their money. She's simply breathtaking.|, just watched the movie. this was seriously funny in my pov. don't listen to the critics and see the film. don't expect in-detailed storyline. just watch it for the comedy. it was hilarious. i loved how ryan reynolds just act as himself on camera. nothing different than him acting or in real life. a recommended movie to watch.|, Salma Hayek is not only absolutely gorgeous, but in this film showcases not only her acting talents but also her impeccable comic timing. Thanks to her this film way exceeded my expectations.|, This movie is not out yet and I already love it. Anything Ryan touches turns to pure gold, his sarcastic humor I live for.|, This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time. The story of Bryce' mom was so emotional. I recommend you to watch it|, The first one was incredible, I can't wait to see this one especially since they added Antonio Banderas AND Morgan Freeman.|, Samuel and Ryan's chemistry is the best thing ever.

He doesn’t get into emotional conversations. He doesn’t make vague threats. He essentially can’t help but to tell you to your face that he’s going to kill you, and then he does, and then doesn’t talk again until he has another target. 47 doesn’t behave this way.

The fact that Shia took his stuff from therapy, wrote the script and played his father is just too much to me. Masterpiece.|, Saw this at Sundance...made me go to my car and call home. It was phenomenal, Shia and his family were extremely emotional at the premiere. Beautiful moments.|, I'm starting to become really proud of the next generation of Film makers. Young actors like Shia Laboeuf and Jonah Hill are two people I grew up watching and it's been absolutely refreshing to see films being created like Mid 90's, Peanut Butter Falcon and now this. I can't wait to see this|, Shia Labeouf has two films this year with a rotten tomatoes score of 100%. Obviously those scores will go down a bit, but man that's quite a feat. Good for him. Slowly slowly, he's rising again|, I was fortunate enough to watch this masterpiece with my girlfriend (celebrating our 4 year anniversary) in Austin this past weekend. Tears kept streaming down my face throughout the film then the ending hit me hard and I could not stop crying afterwards. It unburied repressed memories of my own father and the similarities between him and Shia’s. Truly heartbreaking. Thank God my girlfriend is a emotionally supportive partner and was there for me the entire time replaying the movie and my memories in my head.|, The line where he says “you wouldn’t be here if I didn’t pay you” is so freakin profound. From the fathers perspective is sounds as if the child means that the father would be nothing without him, but from the child’s perspective it sounds as if he means that he knows his father is only there for the money and wouldn’t be around if it weren’t for him getting paid.|, “My dads not the reason I drink... he’s the reason I work” the relationship between them is heart breaking|, This movie looks incredible.. I always thought Shia Lebeouf was an incredible actor. So I guess this is based on his own life, with him playing his own father, and the title of this film comes from his childhood nickname. LaBeouf wrote the script as a part of his rehabilitation program.|, I really respect Shia for starring, writing, and making this movie because it takes a lot of guts for telling the whole world about a sad time in your life and the fact that he took it and used it as a benefit and told the whole world a story.|, Got goosebumps.

It is that gorgeous. I truly wish that amazing woman the very best journey in this life and the next."

Brown, at the very least, deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.  He was brilliant.|, I just finished this movie, and I have to be honest…I LOVED IT!! I usually don’t care for church movies, but this one here…LOVED IT!  The movie was so good I honestly felt empathic for both The Husband, and the wife. Please, go watch it!!|, I can't wait to see this!! All my coworkers look at me crazy when I say, "" shake it for the Lord, shake it for the Lord!"" Love these 2. I bet their on camera chemistry is going to make this a hit!! Can't wait ✌️♥️|, I just finished watching it and I was expecting more. It was okay, but I was kinda hoping they would expose the husband 😂. The ending felt like it needed more? Maybe there will be a part 2?!|, Regina Hall is a national treasure as is Sterling K Brown. Can’t wait!|, Thought it was going to be really funny but it felt more like commentary on the southern church life. Felt like a good glimpse into the different types of personalities and after living where I lived in the south kind of is like that. Just because someone has a big church doesn't mean they're 100%. Just because you go to church and you're labeling yourself as a Christian doesn't mean that your faultless. And just because someone wrote something that's like a social commentary doesn't mean it's blasphemous. I think we all need to reflect on money in churches and the emphasis on appearance. I thought it was well done but I think a lot about church culture. Seen all this. Pastors with families on tinder, crazy marketing to try to get you into church... Actually made me reflect more on how difficult it must be to be a Pastor and all the psychological and emotional challenges that come along with it. It was funny but it was definitely a reflection.|, This movie needs to be a series as well, with Sterling and Regina reprising these roles...|, Absolutely loved this movie!! SOOO deep!!! Somebody appreciate your first lady!!!|, I saw this trailer in theaters. I was rolling my eyes for the first 40 seconds, then there was a point where Regina Hall looks into the camera wit disdain and I was sold. Then they show Serling k brown throwing fastballs the rest of the trailer. I can’t wait to see this.|, A must watch! Oscars for the both of them please!"

I've seen it twice already because it really is that funny. The first one was hilarious, but I'd even go as far to say that this one tops it. The gang just nails it, Chris Pine is joy to watch on screen, and the plot has enough twists to keep you interested. Oscar worthy? No. A good time? Hell yeah!|, I loved the first movie, and this sequel! Both movies I watch over and over and laugh every time! Jason Bateman, Sudeikis and Charlie Day have such great chemistry together and are so funny. I liked seeing the two bosses from the previous movie as well...and Chris Pine was great in this movie playing the likable psycho guy. I hope there is a 3rd movie in the works, I support!|, Looking through the comments most people actually enjoyed it and I think we all deserve another film|, I know it's usually a step down to go from a movie to a tv series but these guys are so fluent with their back and forth it would make a great tv show |, This was comedy gold, just like the first one.

I was expecting it to be a typical 'shoot em up western' but it's so much more, a great story about a harsh time and the effect it has on people from both sides of a conflict and the reconciliation of enemies. I'm amazed more people haven't seen it, the trailer and promotion didn't do it justice. The score was also brilliant.|, This movie is not what you expect, it's so much more.
Possibly one of Bales best performances. How each of the Characters deal with individual loss (and they all get their moment) is nothing short of beautiful.
Rory Cochrane was brilliant! His portrayal of Tommy was superb.
Cinematography was another highlight for me. 
Love finding gems like this. 👍|, I just watched this movie.  Never heard of it until a few days ago.  What an emotional rollercoaster.  I rarely ever cry during a movie.  This one had me in tears for most of it.  
 How this did not win an Oscar is beyond me.|, A great movie. What these people go through puts you on an emotional roller coaster. Bale outstanding as well as rest of actors.|, Easily one of the best movies I’ve ever had the privilege of watching.  It’s just so raw and connected|, This film is the most under-appreciated masterpiece of the 2010's|, Anyone else think Ben Foster is one of the most underrated actors in the business today?|, one of the best movies i've seen ! Pike is incredible in it, and the chemistry between her and Bale is amazing|, What a great movie! Christian Bale and Rosamund Pike played very well. This whole story between native people and americans is so difficult, so many people died because of it on both sides. That makes me sad that people still hardly come to an agreement with each other in our days|, One of the best movies I have seen. The acting is spot on and the visuals are brilliant. Christian Bale is, as always, superb. Treat yourself to this awesome Western."

Each character in the trailer is based on real people who protected guests and some died in the process. The Taj hotel manager lost his wife and two sons. Many young chefs too were killed. It's like our own 9/11. Show some grace and respect.|, This trailer gave me chills. I still remember the day this happened. The news of the terrorist attack at Taj hit like a shockwave. I'm not a Mumbai resident but the terrorist attack was everything beyond our imagination. It was downright scary, shocking and sad. Rest in Peace to the souls of the people who've lost their lives in this terrible incident.|, I stayed here two nights before it happened .........I’ve never gotten over how fragile fate is . The film looks like a fitting tribute to the brave staff who worked in this beautiful hotel|, This is so well made especially with the death scenes. It gives you the thought that terrorism is indiscriminate and lives can be easily and casually lost in any time or place. The way they made the characters as human and as alive as possible with developments, even the terrorists themselves are portrayed as just normal people just like us though led astray by an extremist ideology, then killing them like some sort of a butchered animal really captures the true horror of terrorism and shootings. They really didn't shy away from having two or more of the significant characters die casually just like how any shootings can be. I don't know about this casting issues nor any of the actors and actress but over all, the movie did a good job on portraying how real word violence can be.|, My gosh! Just watched this. The horrors the survivors faced and will continue to do so, I won't ever be able to comprehend! Brave people, heroes. So sad knowing the fact that many lost their lives because of the ridiculousness of religion.
Such an emotionally intense movie.|, One of the most heart wrenching moments ever seen in India in the past decade. Never can forget that day.|, I highly recommend this movie. It was like seeing the real scenes on that tragic day. Kudos to all the actors and actress on this film. Very haunting. RIP to all who died on that day.|, ignore the bad reviews , this is really a superbly crafted effort in film making .. captured the essence of suspense and fear under those circumstances !|, Dev Patel is a true spirit actor, he is acting from heart. when i watch his movies i feel like i watch live action not a movie. there isnt many actors or actresses gives you that feeling...|, I watched this film in the theater. It is one of the most profound depictions of realism I have ever seen. It wasn't entertaining as much as informative and eye-opening to the tragedy that comes from evil. I am surprised that it didn't gain greater fame."

This movie is not meant to offend but to inform.|, James Baldwin breaks everything down in such an articulate and factual way - he was a genius. I love this documentary.|, I know everyone's entitled to an opinion, but who on earth could give this a thumbs down? Exquisite trailer. 
I must see this film, and apparently, others need to as well.|, Wow. He said it all just in this trailer. What an incredible human. “You have to figure out why you see me like this.” He said it all in that sentence.|, I was his assistant in 1968 at Columbia Pictures.  What a wonderful human being.  I will always miss him.|, Um filme que traz reflexão. Um filme que deveria ser trazido às telas do mundo inteiro, nesse tempo de discriminação e de violência.|, I remember seeing this trailer while my sister as pregnant with her first son and I bawled. Knowing such an innocent child will grow up knowing he will be hated by his skin|, James Baldwin sure could use his large vocabulary of words, in the right way, at the right time, and they made so much sense. Giving you understanding of questions you've had in your mind, not only for his era, but words that are needed to hear right now. I appreciate all he did. Observing and writing is not an easy task, as opposed to just looking and seeing, and talking about it. It takes more thought effort to write well what you saw, or feel. And I appreciate him coming back to America when he was so safely planted, in another country, because he felt a need, and a calling, to return, to pay his dues. That's how I feel about the city I'm from, even though many, many moved north, for better living, I figured God planted me here, for a reason, so I just work to improve my space, and let God take care of the rest.
Had he not answered that calling, we wouldn't have all the good works he created.✌🏽❤🙏🏻Rest in PARADISE James Baldwin 🌷🌲🎵|, This was one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen, and hands down, the best edited documentary I have ever seen. The editor even had top bill credit, her name came up before the directors name in the ending credits!|, This is NOT a black story, this IS an American story!  Take a moment, let it speak to you, and learn something.  We have so much to learn.  KD"

Maria's joy is infectious and so devastating given what the audience knows|, Rachel Zegler should’ve been nominated for an Oscar, and in my heart, she won one for the way she growls the line, “Miss America can just resign!”|, I adore the subtle storytelling detail in the costumes. If you look at Maria’s dress, she’s the only one in red and blue. Since these colours represent the Sharks and the Jets, it’s interesting to note that she represents the mix of both cultures, which is also true in real life since Rachel is mixed herself! This kind of detail touched me so much as a girl who is also mixed. Make love not war is the alternative title of this movie and I can’t stress the importance of this message enough, especially these days. Spielberg is a genius, he even addressed other global topics like colourism and in such a realistic way thanks to the brilliance of Tony Kushner’s script and Ariana DeBose’s acting. This is what happens when you’re surrounded by geniuses in your craft! You get a timeless masterpiece that should have won Best Picture and was better than the original for so many other reasons|, I love Rachel's acting and vocals in this scene. She's amazing❤|, why are people acting like the main girl murdered someone… the amount of hate she is getting is overdramatic|, Rachel Zegler puts her all into this song and her acting, I love her and it ! 💚|, I couldn’t stop singing this all day after coming out of the movie theater 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰|, This song is placed like it is in the Broadway musical and gives it the sadder context taking place after the rumble. I love this song and Zegler is just pretty, charming and stunning while doing it!|, Rachel Zegler graduated from high school in June 2019 and she's already been cast in four Hollywood movies. One of them is an animated movie for which she is doing the voice for. She is truly a rising star!|, Rachel was amazing as Maria! She should've been nominated for best actress."

Movies are supposed to take you on a visual ride, like a carnival. Sure, some parts were a little too convenient, but overall, a nice touch on reincarnation and decent acting on all parts. And the ending, a little toned down but still gives you an itch in the eye sorta way. I would recommend this to anyone with a brain.|, Stumbled upon this movie by accident. Didn't know what it was about , but kept watching.. 

Its absolutely beautiful, inteligent and emotional. I loved Ians and Sofi's chemistry, her childlike innocence and foolishness. Its just one of those movies where you actually use your brain and think about ideas presented within it. Maybe im hypersensitive, but by the end of thid movie, I was in tears, but happy I've seen such a great piece. ^^|, I've watched this movie at least 6 years ago and its always been in corner of my mind but after billie eilish interview i came back here and remembered how impressive but also traumatic movie it was.|, This movie should won an academy award!! Story is amazing!|, God, this movie was amazing. It was inspiring and sad and emotional and made me think. I don't know why some people didn't like it, definitely one of my all time favorites. |, It is original and,without being preachy, thought provoking. The writing and directing grabbed me.

I was so with her when she was torturing the scum bags. Loved how she crushed his balls.  As a man i could imagine the pain of having your balls crushed in a vice. He deserved far worse. The girl was such a good little actress. I really felt so sorry for her. I liked how the cop just let her walk away in the end.  I would have let her walk away too.|, I can't express how much I love this movie! It's unrelated to the first but gives such vicious poetic revenge scenes...I mean, does life ever get better than drowning a rapist in a bowl of sh*t?!?! I doubt it!|, This is how all rapists and pedophiles should get treated.|, The horrors she endures is tough to get thru, it makes the revenge scenes pale in comparison. Its awesome though, when she gets her vengeance, but then she becomes the monster.This was a true horror movie and i was shaken for hours afterwards. What that poor girl went through, it really makes you think. Sadly, in reality, the times vengeance is served by the victim are rare and far too many girls have endured horors and been killed after. This movie is hard hitting.|, This is one off the best movies I've ever seen. It is worthy off many awards. She deserves an Oscar for her performance. Seriously though, only good thing about this is that it shows how dreary and dark former  Soviet era satellite countries are.|, Bad guy punching her face was very heartbreaking for me. When the revenge started it was very satisfying|, Never think you can screw up women's life... even if she dies she will never leave you|, Although i find it hard to watch the rape side of it. When it comes to the torture i cheer her on even though its a film|, Hell yeah 2x the revenge sick kills man! Love it!|, I remember the time when my mom doesn't allow me to watch this but guess what this is one of the most powerful movie I ever saw"

I didn't know this would happen so suddenly, when your loved one is gone forever and you felt like your whole world collapsed. At the moment it was so hard to say I still believe that God is good. But when I think of all how God prepared everything in the past few weeks, that we get to share our innermost feelings and cried together the first time, about how he wanted me to not be angry at God even if this happens, and even this movie.

His spirit is just as beautiful as hers was, and still pray for him and his family, as I know her absence from their lives still brings them pain.|, Rachel is such an inspiration to me, even to this day.

God says you are worthy, loved beyond belief, and that you are IMPORTANT! Through Christ, nothing is impossible:)|, I just watched this movie last night,  I can't believe I didn't hear about this before.  Maybe I wasn't ready to watch it, and God brought it to me at the right time. It was very heartbreaking to watch, but Rachel knew she was Destin to touch millions of lives, and she does everyday.  She touched mine 22 years later. Thank you Rachel Scott.|, I met the mother of this girl at a pep rally for my school. She was extremely inspiring and the message hit pretty deep. It wasn't just about God though it was about being just a decent human being and more accepting, that way shit like this can be avoided.|, This movie may or may not be 100% accurate but I just watched it earlier today for the very first time and I have to say it was a very love filled and inspiring movie.

The music is absolutely remarkable and beautiful.|, This is how you put together a trailer. You don't show so much that it gives away all of the movie, but you show enough to give the viewer emotional investment. Bravo to whoever cut this trailer together.|, ""If you trusted love this far, don't panic now. Trust it all the way"". DAMN, THE TEARS THAT SWELLED UP OMG|, All I got to say is this was one of the most beautiful movie experiences I’ve ever seen. Every spoken dialogue, sound, backdrop. It all fell into place so perfectly. Hands down the best movie in the last decade. Absolutely flawless. So much so that I cried when it ended. Not because of the story but because I enjoyed it so much that I didn’t want it to end. I could’ve sat in that theater another three or four hours because the story wasn’t finished. I love this movie.|, God, the song in this trailer is gorgeous|, “unbow your head, sister.”
“trust it all the way.” 
“remember that love is what brought you here.” 
so many beautiful quotes from this movie.|, The music. The music. THE. MUSIC.|, I can't really explain it but this trailer just captivates me in a way that no other trailer has before. The music, the emotion behind, I never read the novel and I basiccally have no idea what the story of the film is gonna be though I can probably guess from the trailer but that's beside the point. The point is, that I'm watching this trailer with having little to no idea of the origional story/source material behind it and I'm feeling so much from this trailer. I can feel the back of my eyes filling up with tears. God I wanna see this movie so bad.|, Am I the only one who wamted to cry after watching the trailer? Everything in this is just so pure, the music and emotions in this trailer really hit and it hits hard. I really hope this is the music in the movie|, Just saw this film. Nothing short of extraordinary! The cinematography and score were simply off the charts good. And the final 3 scenes will all tear your heart out. Bring tissues."
If I Stay,"If I Stay Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Chloë Grace Moretz, Mireille Enos Movie HD",rMp896hfp74,15946291,91671,4207,"I'm not kidding, I've never cried so much during a movie in my entire life, and that is saying something because I don't really cry at all when watching a film. And not just of the sad parts but also because it was so beautiful at times. I swear I've cried through 3/4 of the movie|, I honestly didn’t really cry at this movie. The only moment that really hit me was when the grandpa was talking to her as she was in coma. It was hard to feel the pain of one event while there were flashbacks to other events that were less sad. I think i had to read the book first to be able to cry at this movie :’)|, This might be the only time in my entire life where I can say with full confidence that a movie is more perfect than the book. The movie captures some sort of elegance and beauty that the book lacks, and I can say with certainty that the movie actually has a whole place in my heart, so much more so than the book ever had. It's that beautiful.|, Read the book: cried so hard omg 
Watched the movie: the entire Pacific Ocean literally came streaming out of my eyeballs|, First off, I'm a guy. 
I was like, I'm going to watch this movie because Chloë is in it.
That was really the only reason for me. But as I watched the movie, I found that I actually liked it very much.
This was basically the first movie that I ever cried to.
10/10 would watch over and over again|, this was the most saddest and most touching movie I’ve ever watched. I thought it would be like cheesy but when I actually watched it and can I just say I’ve never cried so much. I cried tears of sadness and joy and literally I’m shaking and crying about how good this is. 10/10 recommend|, I've never cried as much as I did during this movie. I think the director was very clever in his casting of Mia's parents; they were, to me, the most lovable characters in the entire story, with their laid back attitude and humor. It makes you think of adults you love to be around. And it also makes you think of any adults you've lost. When the parents were announced dead, that was the first heartbreak of the story. The story was ultimately about choices and how they will affect the scheme of life; it is not a love story, even if it appears as one. The fact that Mia would constantly be tempted by ""the light"" at the hospital was also painful, with every horrible event pushing her to walk towards it. I thought the movie was a masterpiece.|, I just watched the film on the plane. And i loved it! I barely cry in films but this one caught my eye. When her grandfather talks to her while shes in the hospital, i was there holding back my tears. Beautiful movie. Hope there will be a sequel|, I NEVER cried so much for a movie. It was so beautiful. And I broke down so many times and by the end of it I was just sobbing in my room for 30 minutes and ughhhhhh this is so amazing. I just want everyone in the world to know about this movie. It’s the most emotion-provoking thing I’ve ever watched|, I read this book in middle school, and it was one of the first books I had ever fallen into and felt like I lived. Wonderful story; I highly recommend it!!! It always stuck with me, the second book ruined their story, but the first is wonderful!!! The story is still vivid in my mind after all these years, and I am excited to see the film now that I know it is one!"

It’s fueled with comedy, drama, and action. Ethan Hawke was beyond amazing. I love all his movies including this one. The dog was outrageously smart. Wish it was mine. It never stopped cracking me up. I laughed out so loud thought my neighbors were gonna call the cops on me 😂|, I watched this movie over the weekend on PPV.  It is outstanding.  Shot in 35 mm film.  Feels like one of those Clint Eastwood classics from the 60s/early 70s.  There are some hilarious scenes and, yes, it is violent.|, I'll watch this for eathan hawke, he never disappoints he's such a underrated actor|, I've never been keen on Westerns, but what I love about this film is that it's not clichéd with someone avenging a parent, child, or woman; he's avenging his PET. I totally love that. Even though I have two stupid little chihuahuas, I'd avenge them too.|, Ethan Hawke and John Travolta are amazing. Amazing Comeback for the western genre.|, I don't know if this movie will be any good, but at the very least I'm glad the Western genre is seeing a small resurgence after being dead for so long, and I do love me a good Western <3|, ti west should do more westerns, love his horror as well|, I loved this movie!! I loved Ethan Hawkes character in this and in The Magnificent Seven! These are two great western movies!|, Really enjoyed this movie and the chills that hawke gave me was great with his acting ..|, Hosts are getting very realistic. And the new story line seems interesting as well. Guests will be happy."

I was on the edge of my seat wondering who will survive at the end and actually dropping a tear or two. What a great movie. I can definetly recommend this piece of art.|, There's something about being in the middle of the ocean, in all of its vastness, that truly frightens me.|, A haunting movie. Describing one mans life, doing his job to support his family.  And the awful indignities he had to endure. The sound track itself is worthy of an award. I have no words to praise it enough, nor money enough to support it. But I hope this work of fiction will survive in some form, to educate those that have not yet been born.|, Everyone be talking about Thor and Spider-Man at the same movie but dude, Peaky Blinders.|, I totally disagree with the fact that his movie only got 42% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was a great movie that lived up to the modern day expectation and demands for good acting, outstanding visual effects, and a mutlicultural soundtrack.|, I did not expect to like this as much as I do.

I love how Lin-Manuel Miranda keeps inviting people from past projects to continue to work with him. It was so cool to see his parents in this movie.   I hope he makes more musicals for Broadway and/or film.|, Ok I really enjoyed the whole thing but something about how Nina's dad sings ""good moooorning Usnavi"" just butters my biscuit. It's so smooth and nice and I love it.|, “I hang my flag up on display, it reminds me that I came from miles away” the first time they say that is so powerful I got so emotional|, i am absolutely obsessed with the way that not everyone in the ensemble is doing the exact same dance. it makes the scene so much more authentic because of its imperfection, they'd all look like robots otherwise|, Benny was honestly a highlight of the movie to me. he absolutely knocked it out of the park. including daniela and carla too, they were amazing  and great casual lgbt representation :)|, The writing of Lin Manuel is so recognizable! I don’t know what it is but I can hear his touch in the music and lyrics, even the vocabulary is a parallel to Hamilton and Moana. Incredible talent!|, I love how it only zooms in on usnavi near the end because it symbolizes that he is just like everyone else just trying to get by and he isn't really special he is just a dude in a crowd with his people and nothing more so he doesn't stick like a normal main protagonist he blends in and its just kinda beautiful|, You know what? I think I actually prefer Anthony Ramos in the role of Usnavi to Lin Manuel-Miranda... He just seems so natural and charismatic in this.|, I’m glad they got some of the original Broadway ensemble cast to be part of the dance crew.|, The fact that this musical is in English but also has some Spanish too it’s too much for me to handle 😭😭 Me encanta, de verdad lloro ❤️"

I think that's why he chose Predators too to prove he could pull off action. In summary I'd imagine that this is part of him proving that he has depth as an actor.|, Boy, I am going to miss this movie so hard... :P|, Lindley Lohan must of felt really good doing that shot scene LMAO XD|, looks awesome lindsay lohan is back yeeeey!!!|, i am a huge fan of Clint but still i loved Brodys impersonation of him pretty darn impressive ,   spoofs  are filled with overblown comedies but still this looks okay at-least in trailer |, I'm only going to see this for Michelle Rodriguez and Adrien Brody... because they are AWESOME!|, can't wait|, How did Adrian Brody get from an Oscar awarded role in The Pianist to this?|, the ending was funny though!"

  The signs and symptoms a child with this disorder has depends on which characteristics predominate in the script.|, It reminds me of Ghostbusters in so far as the premise goes.  Taking on a supernatural threat using human brilliance and advanced technology.  This film is just taking that in another direction and mashing it together with The Exorcist.

It summed up the whole franchise, packed it up and closed it.|, However this movie turns out, hearing the original score done in a modern way brings  me absolute chills. Being reminded of the good 'ole days of Indiana Jones when growing up, has no words whatsoever. Thank you!|, I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE WHEN I SAY THIS! A BETTER CONCLUSION THAN RISE OF SKYWALKER AT THE LEAST!|, Watching Indiana Jones as a kid in the 80s was the reason I became an archaeologist!

Even when you think you've done all to avoid causing pain to others, it inevitably does. This is a powerful story, and I pray we all continue to find the strength to survive even in our own unique conditions|, Naomi Watts looks terrific and believable in this, I just worry about the story having too many contrived, impossible moments. Still, definitely looks exciting.|, I think this movie is a metaphor about depression. Depression is a infinite storm that consumes Us little by little. Others that know you and see you smile or having fun they may think you're doing ok, but it never go away.|, Naomi Watts should be in the line of nominees for Oscars this year. Come on, she definitely nailed her character here.|, Watching it now. Really good so far.

I loved Possessor !|, Looks very intriguing. I’m starting to become a Mia Goth fan. Her role as Pearl was one of the most craziest performances I’ve seen these past few years. She’s not afraid to go all out and be unhinged.|, One of those films that had me keep checking the progress bar to see how far i was into it and then it was over and i was left wanting more. It had great effects, lovely atmosphere, and wonderful actors, but at the end i felt like there was so much more meat on the bone.  While undoubtedly impressive in its individual elements, it struggled to seamlessly unite its various components into a cohesive whole, ultimately leaving me with a sense of missed opportunities and untapped potential. I feel like Brandons best work is still ahead of him.|, Mia goth is absolutely terrifyingly good in every film she touches & Alexander is always a pleasure to look at I'll definitely watch this movie for both of them.|, Infinity Pool looks intriguing. Seems like Mia Goth has been involved in more horror projects these past few years. Good for her. She really suits any type of role she portrays onscreen.|, This looks scary and disturbing but because Mia Goth is in it, I am here for the movie! She is definitely one of the contenders for the title of Scream Queen!|, Brandon Cronenberg is a really good director, eventhough he hasn't reach the heights of his father's skills, I think he has a unique bloody vision that would've made his father proud. This is the type of horror movie that Mia Goth is perfect at. At this point, she should just star in every horror movie that's coming|, Mia Goth should star in every horror movie"

There were a lot of very fictional story elements but a lot of very real moments too. What I love about the movie which is not the very best thing one should notice, is the color grading, I like the mix of warmth of the colors and shadows are very high that they found a way to mix the sunny and cool vibe of LA whilst portraying the dark elements of the movie.|, i cried so hard.. she didn't deserve this i understand her she lost her mother and all she needed was just a friend to talk with but she was rejected .. i end up crying to this :( .. this movie is perfect|, Amazing movie!!! I just wish there was more of a back story to Ingrid. I’m assuming she was the caregiver for her mom therefore maybe she became fixated on social media because she was obviously lonely and felt like she had a life through other people. And sadly there are individuals in real life who are exactly like her character😔|, Elizabeth Olsen's smile is something else|, i actually enjoyed this. it's exactly what it needs to be and isn't corny at all like i thought it would be. i felt for Aubrey.|, I saw this movie yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised.It's way better than expected.Aubrey Plaza gives an outstanding performance in front the camera as well as behind the camera.I'm looking forward to seeing what project she's working on next.All around gr8 movie, possible Oscar nod.|, I just watched this movie. It was really good! Both actresses do an awesome job of playing their characters.|, just finishd watching this movie minutes ago. it's a really good movie if that's what you're asking.

Inherent Vice,Inherent Vice - Official Trailer [HD],wZfs22E7JmI,6923073,20727,1869,"Anyone rewatching this trailer years later just because of how fantastic it is?|, People be saying “ Joaquin is such a great actor, he kills it every movie” but have only seen joker lol|, Superb film! Such good acting, and a nice change of pace compared to all the action type films there are today. Also refreshing to see films like this which focus on the acting, and the style in which it's filmed... Loved it!|, Brolin's so inexplicably funny in this movie, I really can't put into words why I find him so funny but every scene with him was somehow amusing.|, I've been really looking forward to this film for awhile now and this trailer makes the film look fantastic! It's my second most anticipated film of the year and I can't wait for December! I definitely love the retro look of the film. It really helps the sell the setting of the film.|, Joaquin Phoenix looks like 1970's Wolverine. |, I haven't looked forward to a movie this much in many years. A P.T. Anderson movie is always an event. Couple that with it being the first film made from a Thomas Pynchon novel and you've got cinema gold.|, Awesome trailer. Showcases the comedy and zany qualities. The actual tone is really melancholic, and sad. Gonna be incredible.|, Fucking good movie. Acting was top notch, story rounded itself off very well and I literally was giggling and predicting lines along with the film as I watched it there was one scene where Owen Wilsons character mouths WTF and just before that moment I had said the exact same thing outloud, just epic. It's seriously fucked up in the topics it covers which is great because it gives the story a real human element. I would suggest watching this movie while high, not only because being high feels nice but much of the dialogue alludes to different levels of conversation that aren't being spoken but are expressed through body position and manner and other things :) I found I was often constructing the alluded to conversations in my head. Me personally I would give it a 9, haven't thoroughly enjoyed a movie like this for quite some time I found myself being immersed into the story and completely forgetting I wasn't in it. On a slightly less positive note I found it really hard to remember names and faces and who people were because you are bombarded by SOO much information and developing story that you eventually just have to give in and let the director take you where he wants to go, kudos to whoever the director is. |, Everyone says this is a hard movie to understand. And some guys are happy to find what a Pynchon movie looks like. Amazing movie, amazing book."

-Disgust was shielding Sadness from the worker 
-Fear with his teddy bear ^w^ 
-Disgust and Fear’s replacement VA’s are absolutely perfect. Sound just like the original

First watched it about 2 years ago and it’s now my favorite movie of all time.|, I watched this film after a bad breakup when I was living in a bedbug ridden low income apartment.  It didn't necessarily make me feel better, but it made me feel better.  Everyone's struggling.|, For some reason, this film fell under my radar. I haven't seen it yet. I think I'm about to. Granted, I'm biased towards Cohen brothers' films, but, regardless, I still want to say, this is a quality trailer. It is well edited to entice me into the film, and yet not tell me too much so that it spoils things.|, Even this trailer was a god damn masterpiece|, Llewyn Davis is based on Dave Van Ronk.

A lot of scary movies consist of mainly jump scares to make up for the lack of story. But this film actually has a story line.|, This must be the best sequel ever for a horror film. Just saw it, keeps you tense the whole movie duration and overall it's one of the best horror films in a lot times. It also lets Wilson demonstrate his acting abilities better|, Last night i saw this with my mom , i got so scared the whole audience screamed during a couple of parts. It was funny, sad and scary all at once :) loved it cant wait for another one to come out|, Insidious are the best horror movies to me, thanks to Patrick Wilson and overall the story of this movies.|, You cannot do this film justice without seeing Insidious (chapter 1) first. In my honest opinion, this isn't as scary as the first film but it's still incredible and absolutely genius!|, First 5 minutes of the film and I was like nah brah. I'll watch it during the day|, They did a good job mixing the events from the first movie to this one and it also answers all the questions that were unanswered in Insidious 1. It was so cool how stuff was blended in. I liked this movie!|, The movie was amazing.....it had a mixture of horror, a pinch of comedy, and a lot of drama that is unforgettable. It's also scary as hell, and im not usually scared easilyxD loved it!|, Trust me.. The movie was soooo great... It wasn't that scary.. But the storyline and the chain of events were amazingly interconnected in each other.. and it deserved a standing ovation.. |, ""I wasn't scared, I laughed through the whole movie!""
I hope you realise that laughing is a physical reaction you get from fear? It's a form of bio-energetic catharsis."

It's going to be very interesting to see how they're all connected with what has to be a prequel to the original insidious movies!|, this one to me was the scariest one, excellent directing, creepy and disturbing images, amazing sound affects, and no false jump scares. makeup and affects were top notch in this one for sure, usually they just get shittier with sequels in horror movies but insidious has kept its respect and delivered a solid trilogy|, Amazing movie!! Probably one of my favorite horror movies I have ever watched in a long time. 9.5/10 rating. Makes you get shivers up your spine and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Many jump scares and an interesting storyline! I thought it wouldn't be good because of pg-13 but it was AMAZING! Good job insidious!!|, I finally watched this tonight I didn't even know they came out with a chapter 3, had already seen the second. Just found out there's a 4th chapter too. I am really looking forward to watching it. I appreciate how story driven and the amount of effort that has been put into this series and I still feel like it's extremely underrated. Great job directors and writers/actors. Seriously!|, I hope someone like Stefanie Scott is capable of playing such a role. I freaking love this series, and I can't wait to see what happens.|, I actually liked the movie. There are things that are done better elsewhere, but it tried to make something new. Not many ghost/demon films are set in an apartment. Not many have only a father. And not many have the eldest child being haunted and not the youngest. And the fact that they did all of these is admirable. Because of that, it is more memorable than the typical cliche horror movies. I applaud such innovation.|, Melhor do que eu esperava!! Valeu cada dia, meses, minutos, segundos, milésimos e centésimos!!|, 10\10 movie. What a whirl wind of emotions this had me scared, laughing and even crying at the emotional parts. I’m a horror film fanatic and very judgemental when it comes to horror films but this movies really good👍🏻"

love it|, This was such an incredible movie and storyline. I feel so proud of the makers of all 4 movies with what they did with the storyline. Was such a pleasant and refreshing surprise. I was actually very impressed having scene all of the others, with how they wrapped all the characters up and storyline with this one. WELL DONE!|, Who’s liked insidious since the first one came out ☝🏻|, I see a lot of mixed reviews on this Insdious movie and I respect everyone's opions on it , but I must say this may be my favorite one. It does a lot of explaining of Elise's young life and how all of it come about. I also like how they tied in her two niece's so they can continue the Insidious franchise .  Very well done in my opinion :)|, Lin Shaye carries this series on her shoulders, and never disappoints.|, Best “horror” movie I’ve ever seen till now! Not so scary but the plot - especially the end - was so good that I wanted to applaud. I would say that it’s a “scary” movie with some emotional scenes based on facts of real life such as family abuse.|, The reason the first two movies were so good is because they were really just kind of one story. The way (in the first one) that they foreshadowed the Bride in Black throughout the movie, and then brought it home by the end, perfectly leading into the second one. They can't really do that with Chapter 3, because it pretty much had it's beginning and end. I'm hoping that this movie bookends perfectly into the first movie, and then Chapter 5 can be centered around whatever the fuck Elise was horrified at in the end of Chapter 2.|, I enjoyed this immensely!  There's something about Elise's family story that almost made me cry for Elise.  It's not about the jump scares at all.  Well done.|, This film was so well written. Young Elise did a PHENOMENAL job.|, I actually really enjoyed this movie.. it had everything great about the insidious trilogy and I found it wrapped it all up quite nicely"

Perfect description of a fathers love and willing to do whatever it takes to protect his seed.|, Can't WAIT for this!  And SO glad the original cast is back in full force!|, I can’t believe It’s been 10 years since the last sequel came out. Time flew so fast right before my eyes! Insidious Chapter 1 and 2 will always be my favorite Horror Films. Including the Conjuring starring with Vera Farminga and Patrick Wilson who plays the demonologist. I remember that I first saw the films when I was about 8 or 9 years old. Now I am eighteen! Can’t wait to see the new Insidious movie this Thursday!! I hope It’s worth the time.|, So excited to see this! I loved Insidious 1+ 2. Still some of the best, scariest sound effects / music in a horror film franchise imo.|, 3:00 pm in the afternoon, on a partly cloudy day….AND this trailer STILL gave me the chills. Well done, INSIDIOUS. One of the most legitimately terrifying entries in the horror genre ever created.  p.s. : super excited to watch. Saw the first one in college at 20 and it’s cool to relive some of the last years of my /childhood/care fee life as a carefree adult lol 🙂|, Insidious 1&2 are so good I’m glad they’re having a sequel|, Just got back from seeing the movie, I gave it a flawless rating, from dialog to cinematics Patrick will and entire cast did a great job. Great movie. Great escape."

Not many movies can follow after a great trailer. This movie was 10/10|, To whoever haven't yet watch this movie, *you definitely need to watch it*
I cry too many times while watching this, feels so real like a family has to be.|, Watching this movie makes me WANT to adopt or foster a child when I am older, this movie is now one of my favorites.|, Just saw the movie few hours ago.  I expected to be average. Or at best, above average. I was wrong. 
The movie is amazing. Funny as hell, cleverly directed, great acting, scenes that makes your eyes water. 
I am pretty much impressed.|, I'm a grown man but I've never laughed and cried at the same time watching a movie like i did in this one.. Such a great film.|, To anyone who's thinking whether or not to watch this movie: please do! It's freaking amazing. It'll make you cry as well!|, I looooove this movie! As someone who was in foster care, this hits close to home & I have found my forever family because of the system. This movie is pretty damn close to exactly what the foster parents go through with all of the kids !! ❤️❤️❤️|, This movie made me laugh hysterically and cry like a baby. Literally, my tears keeps on flowing. Perfect movie to watch, made me realize how important family in our lives. Thank you for the rollercoaster of emotions. Loved every second of the movie.

""Sometimes it's difficult to accept love from someone when you're already burned out from the past, but you all need to have faith again because to love and being loved keeps us sane and grateful being alive.""|, I was definitely only expecting some rose-colored, superficial version of what it's like, with clasic ridiculous problems made all better by a little bit of love. It was so much more realistic than I expected! 
Showing how hard it is, for the kids and the parents, how messed up many kids have gotten, how so many of the problems are going to haunt them forever, and why it's still truly worth it.|, by far one of the best movies i’ve ever watched. funny yet an instant tear-jerker. 11/10 recommend!"

Great movie.|, This was such a great movie. I cried so many times throughout the whole movie.  Definitely a tear jerker. Especially if you’re a parent. Eugenio Derbez was awesome in this movie. Him and the little girl had great father daughter chemistry.|, I know a lot of people might judge the movie for being mostly in spanish but it doesn't matter because it's about the story.
Really love this movie and I cried a lot. Might be simple but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.|, Me siento orgullosa de decir que soy mexicana . Hay que apollar a nuestro cine mexicano vivamos donde vivamos. La verdad la pelicula lleva un mensaje Muy fuerte... Llore como Bebe al final de la pelicula.|, I watched this in my Spanish class in 2014 and then again in 2016. Such a great movie! The ending had the entire class speechless both times.|, I consider myself a tough guy, racing cars at over 200mph and facing fears head on. Well as a father watching this movie made me cry like a 3 year old.|, This is the greatest clean, honest , love story, just movie, I EVER watched...and I am 92 years old!|, oh my goodness!!!! my professor assigned me to watch this movie for Spanish class, and let me tell you; I LOVED IT!!!! It's definitely one of my favorite movies now. The writing, directing, and acting; it's all there!

Interstellar,Interstellar Main Theme - Extra Extended - Soundtrack by  Hans Zimmer,UDVtMYqUAyw,152981877,1434615,81735,"How Hans Zimmer didn’t win an Oscar for Interstellar is criminal. One of the greatest movie themes of all-time.|, We should all sign a petition for the movie to be shown in theaters again. It would be an amazing experience to watch it in IMAX.  What a beautiful movie.|, It's even more awsome when you know that Zimmer didn't knew the script of the movie. All that he has been told was to produce a song about fatherhood, fragilitiy, love. And here is this masterpiece.|, This sound track is enough to take us to space|, The first ever time I listened to this I don't even think I can explain what it did to me. I lost both my parents in 2018. It's been a gaping wound ever since. I choke up everytime I think or talk about it. 
When I heard this I was really high. I just closed my eyes and let the music take me to the very edges of my consciousness. Where memories kept flooding back. Things I've forgotten. Me and my mom on the beach, her gentle smile as she looks at me. My dad and him holding my hand as we are buying the grapes I asked for. Me running to hug them after they came home from a long vacation. 
My tears just kept falling through my closed eyes but it didn't hurt. It was tears of letting go. Tears of ""You're so loved and always have been even tho they're not here anymore"". Tears of ""We will meet again"".
So when I feel lonely I listen to this. To remind myself that we are specks in the infinite matter of time and I get to experience sadness and joy alike and BOTH are gifts.|, Everytime I listen to this I can't resist to drop a tear. I still have in my memories the moment when my uncle told me about this movie, and describing it as the masterpiece that is. He always loved science and technology stuff, and was the one who really got me intersted in sci-fi and space stuff.

Today, it's been one year since I lost him due to a tumour, and I can't think of this movie without seeing his face of joy and interest talking about it. I'm sure he's resting in peace somewhere out there in the space.|, -Born too late to explore earth.
-Born too early to explore space.
-Born just in time to witness this masterpiece of a movie.|, This masterpiece eases my heart in an incomprehensible way. When I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders, when I feel sad or depressed, this brings light into my darkness.|, I’ve decided that for my first song ever in piano I am going to learn this absolute masterpiece|, Wow, the music of Hans Zimmer, what have you done, plays with my soul, this music takes me to space, you are definitely a memorable legend, I admire you with this piece of your music."
Into the Storm,Into the Storm - Official Main Trailer [HD],xBH25XxM-7g,9947249,67060,2937,"*Without a doubt, the best tornado movie made since **_Twister_** from 1996. The effects are seriously good and has quality to realism. Unlike many other tornado movies that just seem too bad. 10/10 from me. Deserves a sequel in my opinion.*|, I was a storm chaser for a bit and let me say one thing, you can't even begin to understand the pure power Mother Nature produces when she is mad. It lifts cars, trucks, barns, and has NO prejudice on who it kills. It is sheer unstoppable power that to quote Twister it EATS everything in its path.|, Its amazing what a tornado can do.  It brought a 2014 video to me today|, The fact that this was *JUST* recommended to me in *2019* I was over here watching this trailer like “oOoOh I wonder when this will come out” 😭🤣|, My boys and I REALLY enjoyed this movie. It's sad that a lot of people in Oklahoma can actually relate to this movie on a more personal level. 😢🙏🏽|, I just watched this movie like 2 days and let me tell you... wow! So I decided to make my own little ""Natural Disaster Movie Universe"" kind of like the MCU, DCU, F&F but ONLY with Natural Disaster movies and I used this movie as the official kick off for my universe. And let me tell you I have absolutely no regrets for ever buying this movie on Blu-Ray. This has to be the 2nd best tornado movie imo. First being Twister ofcourse! 🙂 For those who just checked out the trailer and haven't seen it yet... don't hesitate, watch it! You won't regret it! 😉|, Esse filme com a Alycia Debnam Carey parece ser bom demais, e esses efeitos incrível. Preciso ver esse filme|, I've always been obsessed with learning about tornados ever since the original storm chasers TV show.

My dad, knowing this, decided to take me to see this film in cinema with my younger brother.

There was no one else in the theater apart from us and for 13 year old me, that was so cool. We had a whole cinema screen to ourselves.

It was actually really enjoyable for me. Yes I was only 13 at the time but that was the peak of my tornado interest.

Goes to show a film doesn't have to be a master piece of cinema with a sellout audience to be enjoyed.|, Why is this movie so under-rated? This movie is so much better than the movies ""Day after tomorrow"", ""2012"" or even better than ""Geo Storm""!!! CGI was amazing compared to most of the recent movies.|, I love this movie so much and always will. Was little when it came out and it’s about to be 10 years since it’s release. It’s gonna be 2040 before we know it just watch"

Mike continues to adapt to everything Donnie throws at him. ""Oh, he's blocking with his elbows? I'll punch under his elbows then""|, Watching this in theater is such a treat. Feeling that deep bass when Mike is hopping in his stance, you can feel each stomp in your chest. You can literally feel Tyson’s power here.|, i love how Mike Tyson's character in Ip Man 3 is literally just Mike Tyson.|, 1:58 First part of the fight he was studying his movements and figuring out where the hell all that power was coming from...once he realized that his strength came from his footwork he switched gears and made him fight with a different set of rules. Speed and versatility VS power and endurance GOD I love this fight|, I love how he just showed up as a side boss despite being one of the most powerful in the series|, The bell ringing and them stopping mid-fight when the time is up, was the perfect way to show that both fighters were in total control the entire time. Love the Ip Man movies."

Having seen the movie, it perfectly captures the tone and style without spoiling anything! Go see this movie! It's as charming as you'd expect!|, Great movie! Drove an hour to see it and it was worth it. Not a knee-slapping comedy and has some violence so keep the kids at home, but a mature person will appreciate it. The stop-motion animation is amazing. Never seen better, and already want to watch it again to take in the details. Watch the ""making of"" to really appreciate how this movie was made. They really should have put a time-lapse of the animation in the credits to show the audience the insane amount of work movies like this take.|, Ah god. That line “he’s a 12 year old boy, dogs love those.” Gets me in my feels every time. I love my dog :’)|, Just watched it. It was amazing, and depressing as hell. First movie that’s made me cry in years, partially because I was in awe of how beautiful the animation was, but mostly because of the actual plot. This is (and forever will be) my favorite movie.|, Should have won the Oscar.|, The voice acting, animation and soundtrack are *incredible.* I cannot wait for this movie.|, This was a pretty amazing movie. The dogs are hilarious, their empty stares, witty yet gruesome humor. Just A one artistic genius along with a cute story.|, As incredible as it looked. What a film!|, I watched this recently and really loved it. So cute and quirky. I also admire that even though it has cats vs dogs themes to it at parts, cats aren’t portrayed as evil like in a lot of films such as this, in fact they don’t talk at all, or play a huge part which leaves you to interpret what their part really is in the big picture. This is probably a totally trivial thing to think about but I really liked it because as someone who likes both cats and dogs I was getting tired of seeing films where cats are shown as antagonistic and dogs as precious angels. Instead of having cats be the great evil, it’s an evil, cat-loving human man that is the dogs’ enemy. I love it:"

The new IT adaptations are 10x better than the mini series, I was so glad Andy Muschietti was able to capture the spirit of the book with both movies.|, I still remember when i was purchasing the ticket to the movie and the guy at the counter said "" Here, Take IT"" in a creepy way and it was so perfect😂.|, I finished reading the novel for the first time 6 days ago and watching Chapter 1 soon after was just STUNNING! The cast was fantastic (especially Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise) and I love how Muschietti really touched on the central themes and tone of the story while taking a few deviations. The 90s miniseries has always been a favorite of mine yet I give huge praise for what the movie touched on and represented in contrast to that screen version.|, Still one of the best trailers ever made.|, Over four years later in 2021 and people still come here occasionally to make 2:16 jokes. How incredible!|, Who’s ready for #IT pt.2!!!|, Man, the era and hype leading up to this movie was so good.  I hope we get another film.|, Director Andy Muschietti kept Bill Skarsgård separate from the child actors up until they had to shoot scenes together. On the day of their first scenes together, the production staff warned the kids about how scary Skarsgård could be while in character. The kids brushed this off, claiming that they knew he was just an actor in a costume and that they were professionals and would be fine. However, when the time came for Skarsgård to be Pennywise for the scene, the kids were genuinely terrified.|, It is one of the best horror movies ever made from it’s great child acting, a scary Pennywise played by Bill Skarsgård, amazing scores, and a good amount of relatability."

Just enough info to actually make me wanna watch the movie. cant wait|, So impressed by a24. They have made some of the most exciting and unique movies in recent time. In an age when plots are reused dozens of times, it's such a blessing to have a company like a24|, This movie is the closest thing we'll get to The Last of Us in terms of atmosphere and setting. The movie doesnt go the traditional apocalypse route but instead uses the paranoia and fear from it to tell a horror story. The idea of humans will to survive, fear of trust, and family all make this film epic.|, I went to this movie yesterday and I think it's a great movie. Don't expect classical horror, but instead a very intense psychological thriller with drama. It's more of a realistic view of how things could turn after an apocalypse. 4/5 stars. Good acting, nice cinematography. Go see it!|, Just watched the movie and it was well made.  I can completely understand why some people loved it while others hated it.|, I personally think this was a very fantastic movie because it was able to do something to me that no other film has been able to do. It made me miserable. I’m seeing a lot of complaints that nothing comes at night and that the film had a weak storyline but I think the true goal of the director was to really just make us have the same feelings as the characters in the movie. I believe they did that very well because that ending really hit me hard and I feel really summed up what this movie is all about.|, I'm honestly not a big fan of horror movies, but this movie genuinely interests me. I like how it seems to emphasize mystery and suspense over cheap jump scares.|, One of the best psychological horrors of the past decade. Pairs well with the director’s previous work, Krisha.|, Couple years later and this movie still stands as an exercise in honesty. Not much happens in life. I suppose that epiphany is dreadful... Then people die and it's too much."

Sure there are some plot-holes in the lore and the story, but, to me, the movie was so well made, the acting was so great, the cinematography so jaw-droppingly beautiful and the score so amazing, that i could easily look past all the problems. Easily my favorite movie of 2015, along with Mad Max: Fury Road, Star Wars VII and Anomalisa.|, I love classic horror films. I love how this movie was pretty much the same style. It was so good and easy to love. I'm tired of ghost stories and paranormal stuff (invisible ghosts and demons and what not). Originally for this film struck me at the heart most and I would watch this movie over and over.|, Just watched it and I loved it. So tense and a brilliant idea for a film, it could've been made with next to no budget at all. When that old woman was walking towards the classroom it really got under my skin (as did several other scenes), and some of the scariest scenes are in broad daylight. Great film one of my favourite horrors.|, Not only is the movie amazing, the soundtrack is phenomenal|, The direction on this film is spectacular, definitely inspiration by Kubrick. The score is terrifying and incredibly suspenseful. The dialogue is great. “It” isn't so big or scary but it makes your heart pump. This is one of the greatest horror films I've seen. Ever. Definitely best film of 2015 so far. Just watch it.|, I love the soundtrack so much. It makes me feel something I haven’t felt since I was a child. It’s nostalgic and beautiful for me.|, I just rewatched this years later after hearing a second movie will be coming out. Honestly, this is one of my favorite movies that was released that year. The opening scene was well done and so was the ending. Of course there are some lose ends but i think this movie was so unique and well done. It’s definitely chilling and the cast did well. ❤|, Honestly one of the best horror films I've seen in awhile. Maybe not for the pop out feel, but the eerie creepy nightmare feel. Plus dat score 😍|, In the world of crappy and pointless horror films, I am so glad that there are still the occasional gems....and this is definitely one of them.

It Lives Inside,IT LIVES INSIDE - Official Trailer #1,a5xUbuYHdi8,6404450,44169,2007,"The basic storyline reminds me a little bit of ""Drag Me to Hell,"" where a powerful demon known as the Lamia tortures some unfortunate soul for three days before dragging him or her to hell. This looks a little more deep and scary than that though.|, Love that horror movies are delving more into lore from other cultures|, Love the concept of pisachi. It's what use to refer to the influence of Addiction, depression, uncontrollable feelings of rage. This is exactly what it's like. Really look forward to the movie because it emphasizes the horror it takes to live with it and the bravery it takes to fight it. 
Most importantly no therapist or exorcist can help. Its your fight and you need to win or die trying.|, To me, this movie seems like a brilliant metaphor for depression. Makes me wonder if depression was what was referred to as a ‘pisasch’ in our culture…the fact that it isolates you and eats you alive are all signs of depression|, I'm from India ...I too have heard stories of pisach from my father on how grandmother and her friends confronted one of them. It is spooky cause they lived in village at 1970s and and the village ghost stories with Pir baba and witchcraft were really happening.
I'm already excited for this film, glad to see the producers investing in stories of India.|, FINALLY!! some good horror again! there has never been anything more haunting than the work of an aggressive demon in film, and for too long now I’ve been craving to see it. insidious, though it seems so silly nowadays, was perfect in its time. and the content of the paranormal activity movies—revolving around what a demon can and will do to mess with or harm you—were great depictions of that too. of course, the exorcist is a classic, and hereditary is one of my favorite movies of all time (though much different). but every time, demon movies just win. ugh, I can’t wait to be scared of the dark again LOL. and I never thought I’d say that. looking forward to it!!|, So proud of Megan, she deserves more recognition!|, As a horror fan tired of the just okay films we've gotten recently, this looks amazing and is such a breath of fresh air and a great take on other cultures which is something I've wanted for a while|, It's amazing to see people crafting stories on Indian Mythology and lore, definitely a huge basket of information and creativity. 

Looking forward to see this.|, India has so much mythology about monsters and ghouls, so good to see someone's adapting them in Hollywood."

There certainly isn’t a shortage of story line since Jim Grant has 26 books so far in the series with his brother Andrew taking over. 

Alan Ritchson definitely fills the part and his deadpan delivery is spot on.|, It's insane that it's been almost 2 years  since Reacher Season 1 came out  and now we're at Season 2 like what the hell time really flies for real 😂|, The intensity and action seem to have been dialed up even higher than the first season. The character development and plot twists hinted in the trailer promise a gripping and immersive experience. It's fantastic to see such a faithful adaptation of the Reacher novels, bringing the essence of the character to life.|, We will want season 3 ASAP,  don't let Ritchson get taken away by another company!  He can make his name as Reacher and become the next Action Star|, Alan’s story before he got this role is crazy. I’m so glad he got it because he is Reacher.

I love keira and Chris on screen chemistry is perfect.|, Just rented this movie and I liked it.  Good movie, a lot of drama and action.  It's not unrealistic at all, could actually happen this way.  A must see movie in my opinion. Especially for everyone that puts their faith in electronic money, stock market and the almighty dollar. Two thumbs up.|, Turned out to be a really great watch. It started out kinda sketchy in the first 10 minutes but then it took off. Some really cool action. Great acting all round too. What I don't get is that since the film is under 2 hours, why didn't they spend a little more time on the opening section - fleshed early Ryan out some more.  But I liked it a lot. Easily 3.5/5.|, Without Remorse (how Jkelly ""becomes"" John Clark and hunts down those drug dealers) is probably my favorite Clancy book. I recently re-read Locked On and the part where Clark gets tortured is intense. He's laughing at them till they take the hammer to his hand. Is funny when Ding calls him lefty later on.
Clear and Present is my favorite movie. Raymond Cruz as Domingo Chavez was perfect.|, I've always played the Tom Clancy games but never read any of his books or seen any of his movies. I've started reading Threat Vector and now I want to see his movies.

I love fictional and non-fictional military, government conspiracy and law enforcement entertainment. This movie looks amazing.|, Great cast, great director, and a classic hero getting a reboot.  It worked for James Bond, so here's hoping it works for Jack Ryan.|, Despite the the middling reviews below I LOVE this movie.  Another in the history of brilliant Chris Pine endeavors.  The interplay of he, Keira Knightley, Kevin Costner... is very convincing.  I watch it over and over.  Have to admit I have not read the book.|, Clear and Present Danger is a great film!  One of my all-time favourite films!

Raymond Cruz appears in so many shows, its really quite funny to make connections back to when he played Ding Chavez.

I smell an Oscaaarrrrr|, i am extremely angry that natalie did not get the oscar award for this|, *Finally*! AN ACTOR THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE JFK!|, I love the director's use of the camera, it's a close-up to make us see things in an intimate way as if we're invited in and this effect is helped by the warm vintage coloring. I appreciate this effort because it's different from the symmetrical shoots that are usually favored in movies. Also, Natalie's interpretation is amazing.|, The range this woman has in her performances is insane. She's always someone else. That's how a true actress acts. Being convincing is one thing but being a different person is another.|, I watched this movie as I was 5 months pregnant in 2017, by far the most realistic performance of a woman after losing her husband! Its was a shame she didn't get an Oscar for this!|, I just saw this at the cinema. Go. Go and see it. The script is great. The soundtrack- I actually cried a few tears because this film is so well done. Easily one of the best of the year.  Natalie deserves at least an Oscar nomination."

If Bourne tells you to stay on the line, YOU STAY ON THE LINE|, This guy was really so built different he was able to observe the hitmen, the reporter, himself, the entire crowd, and the cameras all without being seen by them. While formulating a route of escape that dodges all of the obstacles as hes walking and talking. Then clutches a 1v4. Dudes a beast|, I always love how detailed this is. That he knows every inch of the position he finds himself in. Every corner, every backdoor, every trick to be unnoticed, 200% aware & in complete control of every detail without ever  losing his cool|, “Jesus Christ…That’s Jason Bourne” was executed absolutely PERFECT|, I really want to see an alternate scene where the reporter follows every instruction Bourne said and successfully escape|, Jesus Christ, that's King Viserys Targaryen.|, the most amazing thing about this clip ..is that the sniper got a fucking parking space in london...right where he wanted to be....this is pure sci fi at its best !!|, Reminds me of the time I was chased by some bullies in a shopping centre. I ended up taking them down with the crane kick and a bit of mind control ESP-type stuff. When the security spotted me they said, “Jesus Christ, that guy’s about 25 and those kids he beat up are not even 10!” People still talk about it to this day, well, the people in my cell block do.|, What makes this scene particularly more intense is that Bourne is trying to hide and at the same time, helping another one to hide. Watching people, cameras, in a crowded station is nuts. In other movies, you have one static person or both moving independently. It's crazy.|, Poor Jason, he tried SO hard to help that guy.

Because Speilberg didn’t want real audiences to miss the line, he & the editors extended the scene enough for people to settle back down and start paying attention again after seeing the shark; he also raised the volume of Scheider's voice for good measure.|, This movie is beyond masterpiece. You can place this movie against the best and it would still hold its own in every way.  There's literally not one bad thing about this movie. Its story, perfect, pace, perfect, casting, perfect, scoring and soundtrack.. perfect, cinematography, perfect, special effects.. perfect,  and oh my god the acting... the acting.. just perfect.  And this was Spielberg's 4th film.. and lets not even get into his fifth.. close encounters.     This film was so great.. it cause a paradigm shift in the nations relationship with the ocean.  Prior no one even thought about sharks,  but forever after.. the first thing you think of with large bodies of water is sharks!!!..   hell if you a kid like i was, their were sharks in your pool,  heck in your bathtub!!!!   talk about mental damage after watching this film as a kid.|, Robert Shaw was robbed of an Oscar..every moment he is on screen he absolutely owns it.. unbelievable intensity in his performance, yet uncannily heartfelt and emotional talking about his experience aboard the USS Indianapolis... searing, heartbreaking and terrifying story..and all of it true|, I miss films like this - films cast so well, with heart, passion, and a mission to deliver an experience to the audience above anything else|, This will forever be my favourite movie. What a timeless classic.|, 1:47 the suspense building up, with the music playing, as the shark's slowly swimming towards them with the fin breaking the surface just gives me goosebumps like always.|, Fun fact: this scene was rehearsed 20 times where the shark jumps out of the water. 19 times Schneider was ready for the shark, the 20th time he wasn't so the reaction was his natural reaction. That's the take that was used for the film.|, 2:18   ""That's a 20 footer""   ..... ""25....3 tons on him""

That one is perfection through and through. It didn't rely on jump scares to be scary. All it needed was atmosphere and suspense and it delivered. The first movie still creeps me out till this day and none of the sequels I'm sure, can top it. It also makes you care about the characters, just a brother and sister trying to survive through the night with good character development. These newer movies, you couldn't care less who dies. The scene where Darry and Trish see the creeper dumping the bodies down the pipe is nightmare fuel. We're seeing it in the characters POV for the first time and it is just as much of mystery to the audience as it is to the characters, of what they could possibly be dealing with.|, The first 2 Jeeper Creepers were classics 💯|, In the first movie You’ll never beat that scene where they drive buy his house and he just stares at them as he’s dumping bodies down that hole.

Great movie💯🤞🏽|, Just saw the film in a theatre this afternoon.  My review:

It is a rare thing when:
a) I watch a movie in a theatre; and
b) I can't think of anything negative about the film.

I give it a solid grade of ""A"".  This movie is a must watch, especially during this time period of negativity and possible revival.  Let's flood the theatres with people and support it!  Praise the LORD for this production!|, The Jesus Revolution is a must see.  Very powerful.  No one left their seats during the whole movie.  Even during the credits.
The movie goers were groups of old people and right before the start of the movie came groups of young people.  It was amazing!|, I am an atheist, and I found that trailer very moving and life affirming. The idea of people coming together and overcoming differences is something that the world could use a LOT more of! :)|, My heart is singing! I was one of those Jesus Hippies/Jesus Freaks that was changed by the love & power of Jesus through His Holy Spirit! I gave my life to Him over 50 years ago when I was just 18 yrs old and looking for the answers in life. Andre Crouch had a song that said it all! ""JESUS IS THE ANSWER""! STILL A JESUS FREAK even in my old age! He saves and keeps us!!!! 😇🙌🙌🙌🙌|, Who on earth can't love Jesus? Jesus is love, pure love.|, I was there at the very beginning of the Hippie Jesus Movement in March/April 1969 in Santa Ana, CA! We attended Calvary Chapel with Pastor Chuck Smith. It was awesome!

Jigsaw,Jigsaw (2017) - Buckets and Buzzsaws Scene (1/10) | Movieclips,joJ9HnCKNZI,5325348,51782,1646,"its satysfying to actually see everyone helping each other for once in a saw game|, Jigsaw took police interrogation to a whole new level!|, If you guys want to understand why John spared Logan for an honest mistake, and punished Ryan for one too, I think I have a somewhat explanation. Logan was put there because of a medical mistake. And the reason John came in to save him was because he in turn made his own medical mistake by overdosing Logan with the tranquilizer meaning he didn't have a fair chance at the game. At that point he realized that Logan really did make an honest mistake and in turn spared him. I don't think he spared Ryan was because the game was still carried on, and he couldn't just expose himself to not just Ryan but the other people (who most likely would've attacked John fir putting them there in the first place). Plus it could also be possible that John didn't know the full details of Ryan's mistake, and just assumed that Ryan's recklessness got people killed.|, Everybody fighting for survival, while Logan over there is just pretending to be a sleep.|, So this is how Plankton first discovered the Chum Bucket? Wow! No wonder why the chum looked so awful that he has to steal the Secret Formula.|, 0:02 me when the teacher punishes the whole class because of 1 person|, 1:25 

*to everyone saying they should cut the chains...the guy literally tried to*|, I would love to see Saw as a tv series. Only with the same actors/actresses though. No one can replace Tobin Bell!|, The fact that Logan is just sleeping is cracking me up.|, The one thing I like about this movie is that they trick you with the main victim. You think she's going to be the hero that saves them all(and she figures things out quickly), but she ends up being the most repulsive character at the end of the film. And they don't let you know that until the very end. They present her as the heroine throughout the film."

Can't wait to see it. |, I was quite impressed with the portrayal of Jimi Hendrix. The guy playing Jimi nails it! Fantastic Film!|, I loved this movie. It was indeed rare that you have this genius, but you didn't hear one song of him. It's about his dreamy, complex view on life. The film was different, one of a kind. There were no logical things like you would have seen in a documentary.I think you just have to see it before you make any conclusions. Either you like it or not. |, Andre needs to play him again in a proper biopic.|, However andre is an amazing actor, he has the voice down & everyting|, I fucking love André 3000 as Jimi Hendrix, I also like the edition, but the plot was kinda pointless & was expecting a more psichodelic photography. They could done so much thing with this, Jimi is a legend & as much as I love the cast & the edition, he deserves something so much better |, Can we all agree that a new Jimi Hendrix documentary movie for the big screen would be 10x better?

Will remember to stay hungry & stay foolish! 🥰|, When I feel lost, I always come to this speech. It reignites my mind and efforts.|, That was at my graduation 17 years ago... I come back to it from time to time as it's so powerful and brings back so many memories.|, I listened to it as a college kid in 2005, and fresh graduate in first job in 2007.. ""Stay hungry, Stay foolish"" inspired me to try entrepreneurship and do something of my own.....as of 2022, I can say that I have seen more failure than sucess, and today when I am re-listening to this speech , I still found new things to learn...stil it is as inspiring as 15-16 yrs back when I heard it first.

This is the speech of our generation. In 15 mins, Steve Jobs covered a lot of ground with a lot of impact.|, It’s 2023, and I’m coming back to watch this… Missing Steve Jobs and his wisdom. Love this speech ❤|, As a struggler have watched this 5, 6 years ago more then 100 times,  but now i am watching this from the position of a successful person 🎉 such a great motivation  great speech, such a great feelings and story ❤ Thank you steve|, Here I am watching this on my iPhone...Thank you Steve....|, Truly transformational words. I remember finding this speech in the spring of 2008 when I was an exhange student in Stockholm. It struck me with so much force, and I remember showing it to my new exchange student friends who were equally inspired. Steve Jobs was putting into words the exact philosophy of life that we were all trying to connect with and have the courage to live out. Later that year during the summer break, a group of us went on a road trip in an old Volkswagen bus, from Stockholm to Bergen… We would be listening and singing along to Life is Wonderful by Jason Mraz over and over again. And I remember these moments during this trip where I felt so grateful just to be alive and singing with new friends, and feeling that hunger and foolishness, and wanting to never ever loose that. After  the Exchange program had ended, we would e-mail  each other to catch up and would end our conversations with those words: “stay hungry, stay foolish”. 
Thank you Steve Jobs for this wonderful wonderful speech which we took to heart during the summer of our lives. 
And a big shout out to my special Erasmus friends around the world! 
Stay hungry, stay foolish. 
Matias|, ""Don't waste it (your life), living someone else's life.""

A much hard knocking action film than the last one. Keanu Reeves looks so cool and I enjoy his character. It's a basic sequel where the main character wants to take down these characters who wants to kill him and he wanted to stay peace. I'm glad that the sequel done so well and it's fun for many adults alike to enjoy this bloody action film.

A better love sequel story than Fifty Shades Dumber. So does Lego Batman Movie.|, Just finished John Wick Chapter 2, phenomenally better than the first one ( hard to believe, I know).

It was, without a doubt, the best action movie I have ever seen. The representation of John Wick and his friendship with Donnie Yen was amazing.

Well done.|, Obrigado John Wick, por manter viva a vontade de assistir um bom filme. Sensacional.|, I love how everyone in this world knows that John is the most dangerous man alive but everyone also thinks they are the one that can kill him|, Just saw the movie last night and I gotta say this was an amazing movie I went in with high expectations and it exceeded the expectations by a landslide, the cinematography was beautiful, the story was deeper, the characters were amazing!!

The shooting scene from the top angle deserves applause and the cinematography is just great. Stellar performance from main cast members especially Keanu and Donnie. Both of them were in their element. Outstanding finale.|, Just watched it today. The action, the cinematography, and the cast are just superb.

Turn out it was a deep masterpiece about war, life, love. One of the best film i've seen in my life.|, This movie is perfect example of ""Dont judge a book by it's cover"".|, I watched this with my grandmother in cinema. She's a holocaust survivor. I didn't know what to expect and I was really stressed when the movie started. I constantly checked on her if she's okay with what she saw. It was one of the most memorable experiences together. I still remember the tears shining in her eyes and how she loved that they used shoes to tell the mother's story. 
Also we live in Hungary and there are small shoe statues at the riverside as a monument of all the jewish people who were being shot to river Danube, so I think for her the shoe as a symbol had an added value.|, One of the best anti-war movies ever made. Somehow a comedy. Somehow a drama. And about love. I'm touched.|, Let's all agree this is one of the most greatest movie's.|, Scarlet Johanson’s part is incredible. I watched it three times and every time it makes me cry... wonderful movie... war is bad.... racism, fundamentalism are bad. Don’t know why the world is full of these negativities... I think everybody must watch this movie...|, Having now seen this movie, the shot at 0:35 is fucking gut-wrenching|, Randomly got recommended this trailer and decided to watch the movie online since I had nothing else to do.

Journey to Bethlehem,Journey To Bethlehem - Official Trailer,EFXcEWalXBI,6518030,6437,516,"As Pastor of a Church I was offered a sneak preview of Journey to Bethlehem – along with my wife and kids.  This movie is simply outstanding!
This is simply a beautiful retelling of the events leading up to the birth of Jesus.  The costumes are good, the scenery and camera work create a worthy visual experience.  The actors are well chosen and extremely likeable.  This movie has managed to stay Biblically accurate and yet allow the characters to be human – like we are.  There are real emotions and humor displayed, which allow us to connect more deeply with the reality and depth of this story.
I am trained in classical music and Theology and can say that I was pleased in many ways with this musical movie.  The Jewish elements of arranged weddings, customs, agriculture and travel were all well depicted.  I had wondered how they would handle the place of birth and was impressed that even in this detail this movie chose the correct locale.
Few are aware of just how dangerous and deranged King Herod was, and this movie along with a very credible performance by Antonio Banderas give Herod all that delusional jealousy and megalomania.  History has shown that Herod had his wife, her mother, her brother and 3 of his sons murdered. Banderas shows off his vocal abilities and truly brings his character Herod to center stage with a full range of emotions.  His song was a high point musically and dramatically.
The musical aspects far exceeded my expectations!  Several of the songs will no doubt become top hits and I have no doubt this will become a staple for High School and College musicals.  There is true musical talent in this music and even the coldest hearts will melt and shed tears.  This movie is fun, touching and offers a human connection to the Bible’s greatest event.  Suitable for all audiences!|, This is just the most precious masterpiece! I look forward to watching this at the cinemas with my family - thank you to all involved in creating this film, be blessed!|, We saw it in the theater tonight & my 3 teens, 12, 17, 18, loved it!  My husband & I did too. We have 3 musicians in the family & their standards are high. The whole thing reiterates how regular people can be used greatly by God if we listen & obey, despite our normal fears. A very Biblical message! Believable, realistic, inspiring characters.
The acting, scenes, & (even) the singing was wow! Dramatic enough but never overdone, very fitting and touching- and nothing was cringe or Broadway. I was so surprised. I normally don't like most musicals unless they are exceptional! I'm buying the movie & soundtrack immediately!
It will be on many more times before Christmas in our house hopefully and then added to our family Christmas traditions each year.|, Honestly can't wait for this film. I love how Joel and Moriah are in it too ❤|, Fresh, creative take on the biblical story that is definitely worth experiencing!  Well crafted, sung, danced, acted, costumed, set, directed, and performed.  Fun and yet emotionally impactful.|, THIS IS AMAZING!! ❤❤❤|, I was lucky enough to be invited to a special screening of this movie this past Saturday and it was amazing! I absolutely loved it and can't wait to watch it again when it officially comes out!|, Just got back from seeing it with my family! It was INCREDIBLE!!!! I loved every single character and song and every time a song ended I felt like I had to clap for a live performance! It was simply amazing and well cast and I laughed and even cried and got chills. It has been a long time since I felt myself glued to a movie screen. I want to see it again, my whole family does and we gifted tickets at the end as well because it was great family entertainment.|, Great movie !❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊|, What an AMAZING movie. I fought back tears in certain parts. It's a beautiful beautifully done movie. Wow!!! I will see it again. Such a great movie. I saw it today with my family. ❤ what a time to make this movie. ❤❤❤ Thank you!"

For those of you who have never watched the series, I would highly recommend it.|, You gotta love how Sun Wukong had like 4 different forms in this movie: beggar form, hero form, demonic ape form, and rock ape form.|, I thought the dark version of Journey to the West had the best description of wukong, one of the seven kings of demons from the Legend of Wukong.

Now she’s pregnant by a dude she barely knows that she doesn’t like and back onto the old guy. That’s disgusting! I’d be ashamed of myself. Now she will have a baby by some random instead of the guy she loves.|, That first case is a classic example of why America is inbreeding.

Nice line there Gojo.|, The absolute chills you get watching this is unreal. This movie is going to be fire.|, Guys I legit just finished watching it in cinemas, booked the first screening they had. It exceeded all my expectations, the development, the animation, the fighting, the feels. A legit 20/10. Imo one of the best shonen (if not the best) movies I have seen in a while.

It's a nice change of pace if you're having blockbuster fatigue, plus watching movies like this with old people as the main characters are always great 😊|, I just watched this movie and it was absolutely amazing.  Top drawer actors in a mundane existence that is shaken up by Jules.  Don’t be dissuaded by this trailer, there’s so much more to this story than what you see here.  Best movie of 2023 by far.|, I just had to come here to say this was the most enjoyable surprise I've seen in a long time.

Normally I'd be upset that the trailer shows everything, but this movie isn't about the destination, but about the journey. It's very predictable but hits all the right spots. Loved it.|, Such a sweet and endearing movie!!! Loved it!!!|, Jules looks fantastic and intriguing. This is Bleecker Street ( if I'm not mistaken ) third sci-fi feature movie in their library. With the other two Sci-fi titles being ""Save Yourselves"" & ""I'm Your Man""  which I've enjoyed both movies. I look forward to seeing Jules with Ben Kingsley, Jane Curtin, Harriet Sansom Harris, Zoe Winters & Jade Quon in theaters.|, I loved this movie. It was so beautiful!|, Just finished watching, indeed a very loveable movie. And the music score by Volker Bertelmann sticks with me."

That's why I'll always treasure the Jumanji film series.|, This was actually a fantastic movie.  Acting was perfect and the humor was so consistent. People, get off your high horse, quit being snobs, and go see this movie. 

Movies are supposed to be entertaining (reason why they're created in the first place) and I can recommend that this movie is HIGHLY entertaining.|, Didn't want to watch this because the original was a classic. Went to see it today, and had my mind blown away. This is how you do a sequel.|, The fact that everyones expectations for this film were very low when this trailer came out and it ended up being a fantastic film.|, This movie is funny as hell, I loved it, why so much dislikes?|, Perfect cast. Jack Black is doing really great job portraying a girl.|, Imagine turning into the Rock|, Would definitely recommend watching this. The casting is beyond perfect and the playwright is genius. Did not expect the turnout.|, This was unexpectedly really good. Judging from the trailer, I initially thought it was going to be underwhelming compared to its prequel. It turns out to be a really funny (AND BY REALLY FUNNY I MEAN ALMOST EVERY LINE FROM THE CHARACTERS MADE EVERYONE IN THE THEATRES LAUGH SO HARD), action packed hell of an adventure movie that stands on its own.|, Lol just came back from watching the new trailer of Jumanji: The Next level

It's about time.|, I just got back from seeing this with a friend expecting it to be super corny, but it was a ton of fun, had good humor, great actor chemistry and had some emotional moments as well. Loved it!|, This movie is a great adventure type.Those who love pirates of the Carrabian, will definitely love this movie!|, I like how at this point The Rock just plays the same character no matter the movie he's in.|, I can’t believe Disney made a movie inspired by one of their most iconic Disneyland attractions, and it looks pretty good!|, Words can not describe how much this movie was awesome. Couple also, great job Disney 👍|, Building out a story from a theme-park ride is one of the areas in which Disney absolutely shines, and what makes this project particularly exciting is that Dwayne and Emily are so expertly and uniquely suited to play the parts that have been scripted for them.  Looks like a wildly fun movie.|, I'm generally not a fan of these types of movies, but this looks super fun. You can't go wrong with Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.|, This was an adorable adventure! Loved it|, A great movie, just finished watching it and I loved it!! A great time killer that you can enjoy with you family it's funny it's full of adventure some creepy creatures and of course a plot twist that is very exciting, overall it's a great movie 👍"

Incredibly ironic, symbolic & gorgeous but also subversive. I wish there was a graphic novel series for it. Love the actors they used as it gave it a meaty cattiness &stylised elegance I love. Incredible visuals as well.  They could definitely have fleshed out the origin stories more to give it more complexity but still love it!!|, The film is visually stunning! And I don't care what the critics say, Eddie Redmayne did a great job with that creepy character.|, I loved every minute of it. I think that the storyline is very powerful with an amazing climax. Loved it.|, I really liked it.  I loved the action, the romance and the characters.  I have actually watched it several times.|, Many people I know thought this movie was going to suck. In my eyes, it was the complete opposite. It had a descent plot. They were able to capture the visual effects of the beauty of space, which I love. For once, Channing Tatum got to play a uniquely thought out character for a change. I'll give it a 3.5-4 stars.|, a wonderful unforgettable story, that deals with ethical problems in a  esplendid form, but at same time filled of adventure, drama and romance, a underrated classic that must be reckoned, a masterpiece beyond the imagination.|, I avoided this movie for so long, but I just watched it today,4/16/23, for the first time. Pleasantly surprised. 😉Very entertaining story line. And the special effects were on point as well. It really kept my attention. Highly recommend.|, Um bom filme de ação,com uma trama  clara  e personagens bem definidos espero que aja continuação!|, Am I the only one who's pumped for this? I've been waiting on this for awhile now. Dis the Wachowski's all you like, I still stand firm in that they're great directors.|, I personally think that the directors did a great job with the cast members and I can't wait to see this movie!

Jurassic Park,The T. rex Escapes the Paddock in 4K HDR | Jurassic Park,Rc_i5TKdmhs,16688207,112543,8588,"30 years later and this film still holds strong. Timeless.|, A lot of people probably don't realize but this scene is probably one of everyone's first horror scene that they've watch during childhood..|, I remember watching this with my parents when it came out. The entire theater gasped in unison. How on Earth did they manage to create this 30 years ago and to still hold up even today... chills man. FREAKING, chills.|, This is exactly why Dr. Alan Grant will forever be one of my favorite fictional protagonists. This man literally flagged down a Trex to save 2 kids he barely even knows and did it whilst being terrified in the process and kept said kids safe throughout the entirety of the movie. Mans is a whole unit. 😤|, I always loved the look in Grant's face at 3:34, even as a kid. Just a pure mix of amazement and wonder at seeing such a magnificent animal up close, one that he's studied and imagined all his life, while also understanding the extreme gravity of the situation he, Malcolm and the children are now in.|, The T Rex isn’t an evil monster, just a big puppy trying to get the snacks out of the toy. I love it ❤|, I love how there is no background music in this scene. Just rain, roars, and screams.|, This scene is by far one of the greatest in movie history. No background music, just rain, lightning, thunder, screams, and the mighty roar. This is Jurassic Park at its finest!|, Grant was badass in this scene. But people are sleeping on the fact that Malcolm gets out the car, gets Rexy’s attention, probably scared shitless, and yells “get the kids!” Thinking only of them. Legend.|, That’s it. This is it. There it was. The single greatest scene in sci-fi cinema, maybe in all of action, to have ever been produced to date. I don’t know…how it could’ve been more perfect."
Jurassic World,Final Battle Scene | Jurassic World,FtCslvCjZEY,340270357,1641313,51159,"Best fight scene from Jurassic World. The Mosasaurus's entry was unexpected, but it really was the icing on the cake.|, The indominus rex was my favorite dinosaur antagonist in the trilogy and this was the best battle in my opinion. 
It legit took 2 velociraptors + 1 intelligent velociraptor, human sniper support, the king of dinosaurs T-rex, and a surprise attack from a water dinosaur with giant jaws to take this thing down. 
Truly an avengers level threat here.|, Mad respect to Claire for managing to not get caught by a T. rex whilst wearing heels|, This was an epic scene to watch in the theaters as an 11 year old. I remember my Grandmom and I got chills seeing the T-Rex come out.|, Indominus: ""You can't defeat me.""
T-Rex: ""I know, but he can.""

Mosasaurus: pops out of the water.|, 4:06 The very first time I watched this, I got chills. It was bringing back so many memories to the 93’ film. I realized it was Rexy, the OG T-Rex! The Queen of the Dinosaurs! One of the greatest moments in movie history! 

GOOSEBUMPS! 😅|, Respect to Blue for still fighting even while she acknowledges the fact that her siblings just died to that beast|, This was the best part of the movie hands-down. Too bad the sequels could never come close to being as competent.|, No matter how terrifying you are, the ocean is always more so.|, I’ve always loved how - even though the Indominus is distracted with fighting the raptors - Owen still chooses to stay and take shots at her instead of taking the chance to escape with the others. Because this is the best chance they have so far of taking her down, and because there’s no way in hell he’s letting his animals fight this genetic monstrosity by themselves."
Jurassic World Dominion,Jurassic World Dominion - Official Trailer [HD],fb5ELWi-ekk,62276381,974161,51934,"So glad to see the entire cast in one film! This is going to be insane!|, An adventure 65 million and 29 years in the making. I can't begin to describe how much this franchise means to me. It's been with me ever since my childhood.|, Saw it in the theatre today. After the movie ended, the guy that was sitting next to me simply said “ok”, shrugged, got up and left. Perfectly summarizes the impression this motion picture leaves on the viewer. Instead of a survival action movie with humans vs dinosaurs in cities, Universal gave us a movie about saving the planet from genetically modified locusts using genetically modified kids, whilst the dinosaurs are just “cool backdrops”. Nice. And I wanted to like this movie so badly (San Diego is my favorite sequence in Lost World and I had hoped Dominion would be something like this), but this trailer just lied about what the story is about.|, I loved the part where the T-Rex said ''it’s Dominion Time''. Gave me chills|, For me the story line was a bit disapointing. But the action scenes are soooo good and the little references to the first movies where very clever. I watched the first movie in theaters with my dad when i was 13 and the last one with my 13 year old daughter.. and that's pretty special to me❤|, Look, expectations grow as time grows with technology, and this franchise is a great example of how tech and humanity combine well. It was never meant to be one or another, but something in the middle. The first movie will always be a masterpiece, then Jurassic World and then THIS. None in between for me. I enjoyed this movie for all it meant and it made me cry. Nothing has to be perfect to make you feel, something we often forget. Peace my friends.|, Original cast ✅️
Dinos in the city ✅️
Series finale ✅️
TAKE MY MONEY NOW! 😍|, I’m so happy that I shielded my eyes from this trailer for months! I didn’t want a single spoiler. Pretty much all the scenes shown here were brand new and fresh to me - I had to make this experience special! The ending to my all time favorite movie series and raised as a child seeing it. Thank you so much for bringing back the whole cast! I absolutely could NOT wait to see Dr. Grant again!!!! 😭😍|, After watching this movie a few times (including the extended version) since its release in June, I realize how much of an unexpected difference the movie was compared to what was promised in this trailer, but I’m thinking that the “coexistence” of humans and dinosaurs- as what was given at the end of the movie- would be something not fully connected because let’s say that IF more Jurassic movies come out, something could change drastically that could prove to be more than what fans were expecting to see in this final installment|, El trailer está mejor que la pelicula"

She's my favorite actress and I love the quirky off-beat roles she takes. Kinda wish this was streaming too, given the current situation.|, I just watched it and I love it! This movie is relatable for me especially the parental love and toxicity of it. The writing, directing, and the story is really great and I love the ending too! 🔟/🔟 😌|, When Evan Rachel Wood was dancing in front of the window I legit teared up.|, The ending was depressing and beautiful at the same time worth watching"
Kandahar,KANDAHAR | Official Trailer | At Home On Demand,WHs6z9RPGtA,10947383,24355,1239,"Completely by chance I was visiting Al Ula, Saudi Arabia when this movie was filmed (the Kandahar scenes were filmed there instead of in Afghanistan for obvious reasons) in December 2021. The car chase scene was filmed on the same street as the hotel I happened to be staying at; there was a car flipped over and police around (to prevent people from getting in the shot), and as I had no idea they were filming a movie I thought there had actually been an accident! Many local people were hired to play Afghani extras and given Afghan clothing, including the manager of the hotel I was staying at, who was Egyptian. It was really strange to see this sleepy Saudi town suddenly turned into Afghanistan over night.|, Gerard never disappoints, excited for some more action!|, This movie was amazing throughout. Highly recommend it. the helicopter scene at night in the desert is pure beauty.|, Saw KANDAHAR opening day and theatre was half full before noon. Great action! Terrifying scenes, kept you in suspense all the way through. You don't know how it will end. GO SEE KANDAHAR! You will not forget this movie!!!!|, Gerald Butler never disappoints he’s one of my favorite actors. When I see his name in a movie before I even watch the trailer I’m always giving it a 10/10|, Just watched the early release in the movies. Adrenaline through the movie. Really well done. And at the end i really like that they did not end after the action scene but for the main actors showed the aftermath in their lives.

Overall one of the best action movies i have in years!|, This was a really good movie, the critics are wrong about this. I thought it was going to be typical Gerard Butler B-movie trash but it was earnest and well-made. Great performances from everyone involved. Would say it was one of the best movies I've seen this year but you know how the movie fanboys will get. I loved it.|, I see Gerald Butler, I watch movie. Life is that simple!|, In Cricket = Jos Buttler
In Cinema = Gerard Butler



Never Disappoint|, Seeing Gerard Butler doing action is treat to eyes ❤❤"

I'm in.|, I never usually like comedy movies (I love COMEDY, but most mainstream comedy films aren't my sense of humor), but Key and Peele in an overdramatic rescue mission about saving an adorable kitten named Keanu?! I am SO READY!|, You had me at ""kitten dressed as a gangster""|, Any movie that centers around an adorable kitten who helps a man pick up the pieces of his life is a watch... and a succession of sequels!

I love kittens. I'm not ashamed of it.|, I LOVE how very young kitties sound like they're saying ""Meal!"" instead of the typical sounding ""Meow,"" you normally hear coming from older cats.

I LOVE the premise of this movie, too!! Back when Lord Ninja (full name omitted for brevity) was still alive, I would have killed any number of people who were endangering him or trying to harm him. Hells, if someone or a group or even gang of 'someones' had deliberately harmed or killed Ninja, I would have unthinkingly and unreservedly put my life at risk to avenge my beloved Lord and Master.|, Can't believe this movie is 7 years old already|, If your heart doesn't totally melt at 0:13, it's because you don't have one.

And hopefully it went better for these two in this film than it did in Fargo (season one).|, This movie and Step Brothers are two films I could watch every single day and never get sick of. I literally used to watch step brothers every single night to go to bed and know every single line by heart while Keanu is my laugh out loud movie that has me geeking out like crazy. But watching Keanu I realized how traumatized that little kitty must be with being around so many damn shoot outs and murders since she was born lol"

Killers of the Flower Moon,Killers of the Flower Moon | Official Trailer 2 (2023 Movie),7cx9nCHsemc,17500355,61162,4271,"Through the very brief scenes of the trailer, I could see that it recreated exactly what I imagined from reading the book (and from reality). One could say that a nearly 4-hour movie is boring but to me, 4 hours of Scorsese's cinematic talent is such a bless. What a move to long for.|, As a person of Osage descent living near where this was filmed, I am genuinely looking forward to a film for the first time in a long time.  From what I can tell they have recreated this story to a tee while being historically accurate which is commendable.  They went to the extent of doing renovations to the entire downtown Pawhuska to make it as close to what it looked like in 1920 as possible.|, It’s genuinely phenomenal. I sat through the credits in a state of disbelief, at the horror of the events and the mastery of Scorcese. Phenomenal filmmaking|, Anybody that's excited to see this movie, you're in for a treat. Each performance is crafted to perfection, and the movie flows like you're watching a documentary. Outstanding|, I can’t wait to see this film.  This trailer gave me goosebumps.  Scorcese is still taking risks at 80 & it is wonderful to see.  Easily one of the best filmmakers in history.|, This is by far the best movie in a long time! Actually a movie 🎥🍿 that's worth going to the theater! Oscar perfection! Bravo 👏👏👏 Heartfelt ❤️|, I finished reading this book a little over a week ago and I can honestly say it's one of the craziest stories I've ever read. I'm really happy that it's got an incredible cast of actors and filmmakers behind it. You would think this is the kind of stuff that's taught in schools, but like a lot of America's dark history, it is brushed over and forgotten.|, This was truly a great film! It provided a  historically accurate detailing of events by the Osage Tribe.  Although we don't always want to pull up the past because it isn’t pretty, the point  ow is to remember and highlight what happened to this tribe in Oklahoma.   The people that were involved in these  events are the ones responsible for the decisions that they made and for what transpired afterwards. As the viewer, we can appreciate it for what it is through Scorsese a glimpse of native american history.  DiCaprio’s and Gladstone’s acting had me believing that he could be the marrying kind. The wide range of characters in this film can’t be praised enough. Enjoyed this movie very much!|, Stunning movie. Visually, thematically, musically and of course the acting is phenomenal. I felt like a fly on the wall, like I could smell the wood of the chairs and feel the grit from the dirt roads between my toes. It’s heavy too… very very heavy. Actually haven’t stopped thinking about it since I left the cinema and the atrocities committed by white Americans to the native people. It’s truly heartbreaking and this needs to be taught in schools and there needs to be justice for these people.|, As an Indigenous person this movie made me cry. I'm so happy with how this story was told and that some of the atrocities Indigenous people have faced are finally being told. The cinematography was beautiful and I would love to watch it all over again."

No gimmicks, no antics. Just pure comedic genius.|, My favourite stand up ever. It is genuinely hysterical from start to finish with no dead spots. Never gets old.|, Chappelle at his peak, I miss this time in my life so much sometimes.  Watching this special brings back so many memories, it reminds me of all the family members I've lost in the interim, and how things can never be the same again. 

Never thought his special would make me emotional in 100 different ways, but it represents such a special place and time in my life, and I'm sure it's the same for many other people.|, This was filmed over 20 years ago. And it has aged like a fine wine.|, I like how the crowd was giving him standing ovations throughout the whole show, basically acknowledging this performance was legendary😂|, not ashamed to admit that I circle back to this at least 3 times a year. Absolute masterpiece of a special|, You know you're legendary when your material slaps even harder TWENTY YEARS after it first came out|, No one else could talk about real issues and have every single person able to laugh. This is by far the best stand up hour I have ever seen.|, I remember seeing this special on TV as a teenager when I was terribly sick with the flu and it had me laughing until I thought I was going to throw up. Still my favorite thing Chappelle has ever done.|, Watching this again, you can actually see the evolution of his comedy. Dave Chappelle is the Micheal Jordan of comedy. A legend."

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword - Official Trailer [HD],jIM4-HLtUM0,10847862,43286,3530,"I don't know why everyone says the movie is awful. I absolutely loved it!|, One of the biggest misdirections from critics ever.  A very enjoyable film, lots to see, some nice humour, a great soundtrack and an entertaining story.  Critics you are so so wrong!|, This movie deserves way more love. It's a fun and entertaining action flick|, Great movie. I don't know why it didn't do better in the box office. Loved it.|, The opening sequence is truly beautiful. A well crafted world that draws you in. Music that fits the world and arouses emotion. It has really good cinematography in the parts that matter, such as where excalibur being used, the sequence with the lady of the lake, the king displaying his absolute authority, and many, many more. They managed to create a narrative that encompasses a lot of the Arthurian mythos we love while blending it with a romantic English atmosphere. The combat sequences in the latter part of the movie before the climax could have been done better, but all in all, for a 2 hour movie, it does a great job at keeping your attention. I would have liked to see Charlie Hunnam give a speech to the people, either at the beginning when he's almost executed, or at the end at his coronation, but his performance was otherwise stellar. I appreciated the cast enormously. Eric Bana, whom we know from Troy, plays Uther. I also liked the inclusion of Katie McGrath, who played Morgana in the TV series Merlin, though I wish she would have had a bigger role. It would have been good to see Merlin and a bit more of Arthur's character. I felt that they concentrated too much in that one scene where Uther dies, though I suppose that without it the movie wouldn't make too much sense. However, I wish I would have seen a bit more of who Arthur is. And more than that, where the sword came from. After all, you'd think that with a title like that, the origins of the blade would have played a bigger role. All in all, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword will surely go down as the best modern rendition of Arthurian legend.|, There are many mistakes I´ve done in my life, but one of my biggest mistakes was, not to watch it in the cinema, so I could show the producer, how incredible  insanly nice this movie is. The soundtrack, the way of telling the strory, the humour, everything was giving me goosebums every minute. I´ve watched this at least 4  times on netflix already. Let´s gain as many likes as possible, to show Warner Bros. that if the second one comes to the cinema, we will enter it at least 3 times to show how great this trilogy can become!|, This is one of the best films I have seen. Don't understand the hate directed towards it. It's an epic film, with a great cast, a terrific soundtrack, a surprisingly moving story, an epic scope and gorgeous cinematography.|, It's been over fifteen years since we've had a King Arthur movie and this trailer is definitely better then the last, especially with Zepplin giving it that extra epic kick! This trailer ironically seems to be cut less to look like a standard Ritchie film, which is a good thing! I didn't know Law was the villain so now I'm looking even more forward to this! I actually thought Hunnam improved since Pacific Rim where admittedly he was kind of stiff! I thought he was very good actually in Crimson Peak! Kind of curious about the Lost City of Z! I hope Hunnam can move past Sons of Anarchy  because he has the makings of a movie star and the more experience he get's people will start to see it! Just found out the other day he was on Undeclared before SOS. Maybe he should reconnect with Apatow and try some more comedy after doing these more action oriented pieces.|, This movie was so badass, that I had to watch it like 6 times. Probably one of my favorite movies.|, Don’t know how this film didn’t do well. Love the movie, my mother who is not interested in hero-kind movies likes it. 
When I saw the trailer, I was expecting a historic take on the story. Instead, it blew my mind. It’s a power-metal-monsters-slaying video-game-like movie. It’s very entertaining and a good movie. A lot of fun. I enjoyed every second of it."

It's beautifully crafted and moving.|, This is what every daughter deserves...parents who stand by them no matter what|, Will Smith won an Oscar for this, along with the Pursuit of Slappiness.|, All I can say, is that I remember being a little black girl living in Switzerland (I repeat: SWITZERLAND), seeing no one looking like me on television ever, then seeing these too girls with braids and pearl on their hair and being so freaking happy about it, so proud! Understanding that all is possible! It lead me to become the first black tv host on the french part of Switzerland and God it feels good to finally see a movie about them!!!|, Excelente forma de poner en pantalla la vida de Serena y Venus Williams, junto a un grande de la pantalla como Will Smith|, “The most dangerous creature in the world is a woman that know how to think...” can’t wait to see this film, it’s going to be an inspiration for a whole bunch of little girls out there.|, He was a guardian, coach, teacher, mentor, and their strength, plus much more that im missing. His daughters was his life, he was determined to make something of his daughters, he had a plan before they were born! That is a dedicated father that believed in them. And what makes this story different from all other athletes , besides the fact that they were raised in Compton and playing a sport that the public wasn't used to seeing black women playing, but he was determined to get them to be the best and the daughter's didn't want to let him down out of pure love and gratitude for his dedication. The family bond is THE STORY. A lovely story!! This story really touched me because growing up my father took me to all my sport functions home and away games, cheerleading, dance squad and conventions and dance camps in the mountains, driving me all over the state of California. Everything i was involved in, i always thought i drove him crazy but finding out years later that he loved being apart of all that.  I miss him so much because a father can conceive you but a Dad will show his love by being your encouragement and strength to be your best while you are young and their reward is to see u grow up into a well rounded adult. I love him for that for being the best father to me. I was very lucky.|, Just watched this movie.  I don't care, Will Smith did a PHENOMENAL JOB, if you've ever watched any old interviews when Venus and Serena were little girls, that's EXACTLY how their father talked and his demeanor.  This movie was real and very inspirational.  If you don't walk away thinking you can conqueor this world after seeing this, it ain't in you to win.|, Hermosa película, ojalá  más  padres apoyen e impulsen siempre a sus hijos"

It will help us gain a positive prospective and encourage us in a time when so many things are negative.  Their are souls and lives to be saved and we need to continue holding up the banner for God for all to see.  Looking forward to seeing this movie.|, Just came from the movies and watched K.M.R .

WHAT A POWERFUL Documentary.  I pray and hope Dr Evan's puts this on DVD to purchase|, I viewed this in Berkeley, CA today. I stumbled on the trailer just a few hours earlier. It was EXCELLENT and should be viewed by everyone that is a believer. I am not easily impressed by movies especially on Christian topics because they are usually entertaining and lack depth but this is such a timely message in these last days. I just couldn't understand why more church folk weren't there and why I had not heard or saw this advertised before the last day of the 2 day only viewings? Did you advertise this in churches? I don't attend churches any more because they weren't doing any outreach and weren't open to me wanting to work with youth. Satan has infiltrated the churches and 501 exemption and egos have weakened the churches.|, Praying for you Kingdom MEN!! I’m looking for a man to ♥️ me like JESUS does! 
Get to know your Savior!!|, Amen! Our Heavenly Father is calling men back to the role He created us for.|, This book changed my life. Glory to God.|, Would love if this was in theaters here in Kenya. Ever since you made your visit for the Kingdom conference last month in Parklands Baptist Church in Nairobi last month, my husband and I have been listening to your sermons and now we would love to share this movie with others around us. How can we watch it here?|, Direct my path LORD!  Show me your way.|, Looking forward to this!|, Awesome documentary!"

Certainly worth seeing and so much fun to watch. I was literally in awe the whole film.|, Kingslaive Final Fantasy XV is an amazing movie 
The graphics, performances, and the music is on point
If only the story is a bit refined this movie would have been a big hit like Avatar|, Never played a Final Fantasy game before but this looks absolutely beautiful!|, The thing i liked about this movie is that it felt like a movie, like you didnt have any of that odinary anime stuff that you would usually see in anime no, instead you had something that no anime would have done. I actually showed this to my mother and grand mother today and they both loved it. Amazing movie even though they didnt like the war parts, still this movie was just amazing i wish their were more anime movies like this, like i know of some anime that have this type of style but none of them were able to do something like this at least.|, Um dos melhores filmes da história da computação gráfica. ♡ ameiiii|, Ok this movie was actually super legit, better then a lot of movies I see these days.|, I just saw this movie yesterday in the theaters.

My way was such an amazing song choice I’ll never forget this trailer legitimately.|, This is honestly one of the best trailers I have ever seen! The music, the fast pace, the way it doesn't give everything away, the insane action shots... just WOW! This might be the only trailer I have voluntarily watched multiple times!|, I don’t say this lightly, but this is one of the best trailers to a movie that I have ever seen. Although it does give a lot away.|, This is how one should make a trailer. The editors have done extraordinary job on how the music is synchronized with the action and cuts, hitting just the right parts. By setting such a well structured pace for the video, they managed to create the best possible mood for the trailer: energetic, epic and original when it comes to those amazing new camera angles and fighting scenes! 

Hands down, this is top-notch cinematography. Easily my favorite trailer by this far.|, This is it, this is the greatest trailer I've ever seen in my life. No trailer has ever given me chills like this one has.|, That shot of him just standing in the rain with the umbrella combined with the music was amazing|, I saw this trailer in theaters first and when 0:36 came around chills went down my spine for how well fitting this song is to the trailer I love it so much|, I feel like it would've been better if they didn't show that Harry is alive in any of the trailers, it would've been such a great surprise|, It’s been years since this came out and I’m still pissed that Pedro Pascal wasn’t in the top billing. He’s one of the best parts of this movie!"

Action, Adventure, and Comedy all rolled into one awesome bundle. I went with three family members and they all loved it and was thrilled. I am a action/adventure type myself and I wasn't disappointed.|, Best film I've seen in soooo long.

The director is a genius!|, Love this film, could watch it again and again. James Bond now they are classics but they get boring after a while.This tops that. This is by far one of the best films I have seen. It is definitely a must see if you haven't seen it already. I for one hope there are many more to come, amazing, not just action packed and good fight scenes but some really heartfelt stories and gripping moments where I think oh my god, awesome film.|, The trailer doesn't give this movie enough justice. I absolutely loved it|, It's been about two months since I've seen this movie, and I still can't get over how freaking awesome it was!! Best movie I've seen in a long time, can't wait to watch it again|, This movie was freaking amazing. Every scene was so well executed. And acting was just on point! 2 thumbs up for sure!

Knights of the Zodiac,KNIGHTS OF THE ZODIAC - Official Trailer (HD),Sko0o_KoBHY,4169854,58935,6385,"As a long time Saint Seiya fan, I just hope they don't change the plot.

I really do hope they can pull this off.|, So so happy Mackenyu is gaining recognition! He deserves it all💕|, They can't possibly fit all of it in one movie, there will be sequels for sure.  I can't wait to watch it.  Love all the knights!!|, Mackenyu is such a great actor! So happy to see him lead this project! This is gonna be a good one!|, Bardzo fajny film a główny aktor to przystojniak ❤|, Just hope they make it like Rurouni Kenshin was made... that was a masterpiece. Be faithful to the lore and it's golden.|, O elenco está tão animado pra esse filme, eu realmente espero que seja bom e que dê tudo certo.|, From what I've read about the plot of the movie, Seiya is supposed to be searching for his missing sister which is pretty accurate with the original story. In the classic anime, Mitsumasa Kido tells him to go to Greece and come back with the Pegasus cloth in order for him to find his sister. Looks like this movie might lead up to the battle at Sanctuary. If they do a good enough job, the second movie could be the Poseidon saga and the third movie could be the Hades saga. But that's being extremely hopeful that they get this first movie right.

Edit: According to the most recent article I came across about this movie, it's supposed to be the 1st of 6 movies. But they'll be based on the Netflix adaptation of Saint Seiya. Soooo we'll have to wait until the movie comes out to see what direction they plan on going in. Also, Kurumada says he enjoyed the movie and thinks the fans worldwide will also enjoy it.|, I watched Saint Seiya as a child and it's one of my favourites. On another note, I am always skeptical watching live actions just because I feel disappointed on how the anime is 'translated' into live actions. Hopefully this one can be pulled off the way Rurouni Kenshin was (I gave Samurai X 9/10 because of Sanosuke)."

A very intricate and engaging movie, no boring parts at all! Great cast and writing!|, Honestly one of the best murder mystery movies ever made in my humble opinion. Almost like a modern Agatha Christie story, with less darkness and more comedy. I can't wait to watch it 20 more times lmao|, Hands down one of the best murder investigation movies of all time. The whole movie was made like a symphony, so much chaos but with done with an elegant order. You think you've figured it out and all the events lead to one truth, but as the movie nears its ending everything you thought was the truth becomes the lie, and that there's a far more greater hidden truth! Just like a symphony.|, When this many fantastic actors are in a movie, you know it's gotta be either excellent or utter, utter balls.|, I honestly wasn’t expecting to love this movie so much, but now it’s probably my favorite out of everything that came out this year. 10/ 10 would recommend!!😍❤️💯|, This is the closest to Steve Rogers’ look and Johnny Storm’s personality that Chris Evans ever done outside of Marvel movies|, People will say Daniel Craig's best role is Bond, but I was blown away by his performance as Benoit Blanc. Absolutely killed this role.|, No CGI, explosions, fancy fast cars, mutant powers, alien landings or robots.  Just good writing and acting with a trailer that doesn't make you feel like you know the ending. Super.|, Great performance from all the cast. Writing and cinematography was spot on. 10/10"

He chose a film career in a much more artistic way than all the other bling-ass wrestlers. And he didn't just choose them because of the content, but he also justifies each and every role he takes. A truly credible man.|, the little girl is amazing!!! the genuine fear in her eyes it’s so chilling at her age. can’t wait to see this.|, Just saw this in the cinema. Extremely uncomfortable movie, many close-ups, lots of emotions and twists. No blood or gore just pure psych thrills and chills! Bautista's performance is top as is the rest of the cast. I give it an 8 of 10|, The best thing about this movie was Dave. Honestly I didn't expected much from him but he leaves a mark, he was so good.|, Bautista is the man!  So proud of him and his acting career!  And look at Rupert too!  M Night really pulled together a great team!|, Watched this last night. Still in awe. Great writing, acting and visuals. 10/10 in my book.|, Man, Dave is growing so much as an actor. It’s great to see. He’s a legitimately great dramatic performer now, totally believable|, Dave Bautista carried the movie, but everyone else was amazing. I also liked Rupert, he had a small time on screen but the way his desperation was shown was top notch, all of the four really seemed like they were on their tip toes.|, Horror movies have always had a special place in the hearts of movie lovers. These movies have the ability to scare us, leave us on the edge of our seats, and give us a thrill that we just can't get from any other genre. The trailer for the upcoming horror movie has just been released, and it's already giving me chills!

The trailer starts with a dark, ominous tone, setting the mood for what's to come. We see a young family moving into a new home, which seems like a dream come true. However, things quickly take a turn for the worse when they begin to experience strange occurrences that they can't explain. As the trailer progresses, we see the family being terrorized by an unseen force, with each scare getting more intense than the last.

One of the things that I love about horror movies is how they can make us feel like we're right there in the action. The trailer for this movie does an excellent job of immersing us in the story, with its use of sound, lighting, and camera angles. The tension builds throughout the trailer, leaving us with a sense of dread that we just can't shake.

The characters in the trailer are also well-developed, with the family being portrayed as relatable and sympathetic. We can't help but feel sorry for them as they're being terrorized, and we want to see them make it out alive. The unseen force that's terrorizing them is also portrayed in a way that makes it seem almost human, adding an extra layer of complexity to the story.

As a horror movie fan, I'm always looking for movies that can scare me, and the trailer for this movie certainly does that. The use of jump scares, suspenseful music, and creepy visuals all work together to create a sense of unease that just won't go away. I can already imagine watching this movie with all the lights off and my heart racing, wondering what's going to happen next.

While some people might shy away from horror movies because they're too scary, I believe that they're an important part of cinema. Horror movies can make us face our fears and push us out of our comfort zones. They can also be a way for us to explore deeper themes and ideas that we might not otherwise be able to confront.

In conclusion, the trailer for this upcoming horror movie has me excited and scared all at the same time. It's clear that the filmmakers have put a lot of thought and care into creating a story that will keep us on the edge of our seats. I can't wait to see what happens to the family, and to be scared out of my mind in the process!|, Loved this movie. Kept me on pins and needles and wondering whether it was actually happening or if they were crazy"
Kong: Skull Island,Kong vs Skull Crawler | Kong Skull Island (2017) | Warner Bros.,bL9MQZQPefo,9888167,78960,5057,"I liked the details on the Skullcrawlers. They have nudges on their tails to have better hold whenever they used it as their ""feets"" or third ""hand"", and those nudges are shaped like fins to be more aerodynamic. They even have false eyes like those on the Orcas to make themselves looked more lifeless and intimidating. Overall, it really felt like they evolved naturally that way over the years unlike other movie monsters whose physical appearance felt unnatural|, Fun Fact: In this movie Kong isn’t even a teen yet.|, The reason why Kong does his best in saving other species is because of his parents. He got trauma when he was young when he witnessed his parents get killed by Skullcrawlers. Now he instinctively saves others.|, I love the way Kong utilizes tools and weapons, such as turning the tree into a club and using the propeller like a flail and boxing glove.

Throughout both KSI and GvK, they really show the level of intelligence Kong has though his expressions and his use of tools. Goes to show you there is more to intelligence than talking.|, Love this film's depiction of Kong's intelligence. He just looks at the propeller and recognizes it to be a useful weapon. Heck even breaking the branches of the tree making it into a baseball bat is awesome.|, 5:14 Many people didn't realize what happened here, so allow me explain. Kong, unable to open his hand because Weaver was in there, moved his arm in a circular motion in order to wrap the Skullcrawler's tongue around it. He then yanked it out, which also pulled out its internal organs. I love this movie.|, I love his reaction to the propeller.

“Oh yeah, you’ll do *just* fine.”|, imagine showing this to someone born before the 1900s, they’d think it’s real|, Kong is like the batman of the monsterverse. His parents died in front of his face. He decided to protect people and the island. He's badass.|, 0:51 That shot of Mason watching the fight unfold while the sparks fall around them is so damn amazing. You get to really see the difference in scale between the characters, and the cinematography really makes you understand how small she is next to this battle of titans."
Krampus,Krampus - Official Trailer (HD),h6cVyoMH4QE,21925480,94805,10552,"The movie surprisingly really good! It's not cliche. Has a good storyline. It's actually a horror movie. Lots of creepy scary face and things. In another words, Christmas with horror/dark genre. Totally recommend people to watch it.|, Ever since I saw this movie it’s been a tradition to watch every year|, Watched this movie the day it came out, it was better than I thought it would be! It's filled with a good blend of comedy and horror, and actually has a good lesson about family, and what's happening to Christmas as a whole.|, 5 years later and this horror still had an impact on me in 2015 and gives me chills|, I would really like a sequel to this. Imagine seeing another group of people dealing with this.|, Not sure if this a comedy or a horror flick....|, Lets be honest here.... Even if it doesn't have a happy ending is one the best Christmas movies|, I really REALLY like this movie. Though for some the horror may seem weak (not for me though, I get scarded easily), I still liked it. I like the idea of the movie and the acting and everything EXCEPT the unclear ending that was made so that the audience can create there own. I like movies with a SET and DEFINITE and EXPLAINED ending, not so I can make my own ending.|, I feel like I love and appreciate this film more and more each year when I watch it each December 🙂 Such a unique film. One of its kind.|, Really enjoyed it. The movie seems to take concepts from films like Hellraiser, Puppetmaster, and Evil Dead (1 & 2) while applying them to a Christmas horror movie about Krampus. The mixture of practical effects and CGI works fantasticly, acting is well done, and the monsters just look legit scary. In my opinion, great movie for any horror fans looking for a holiday flick."

I'm thinking...this going to be stupid and not nearly the cool movie that I remember at 6. Just saw it. Still one of the coolest movies ever!|, Such an underrated movie. Also one of James Horner’s best scores. This scene and the riding of the fire mares sequence.|, I was 12 years old when I saw this great fantastic epic film. I was in total awe of it. I saw it when it was released way back in '83. I cannot tell you what a magical and surreal experience it was for me, a nerd with too much imagination lol. I love this movie very much, and it remains one of my all-time favorite films.|, Mesmerized I was when I first saw this movie as a 12 year old.  So way ahead of its time, and underrated.  Cyclops is a legend.  Would not want to say anything negative about his kids on parent/teacher night! 😀|, 01:55

I have always loved Colwyn's reaction shot there. Like, ""Holy SH#! These guys are bad asses!""|, Unique enemies and weapons, mixed with awesome fantasy and a killer soundtrack!!!|, The current hacks in Hollywood tried to launch a, ""Krull sucks,"" campaign in social media and failed, because this movie still holds up today. This scene is only one of several very exciting scenes with perfect pacing, great scoring, fabulous acting and editing...everything really, except for some of the special effects. This movie deserves a remaster.|, this movie deserves a continuation. I'd like to see how things went with colwyn's son, since he was destined to rule the universe|, There are three slayers coming toward the wizard and kid. When the cyclops spears one of them, the other two start to back away. I always thought that was cool, like, they know his story, they know why he's a cyclops, and that its not his time. i.e. he's unkillable. LOVE Krull.|, Underrated movie. Love the slayers & the glaive weapon."

A little fun fact, when the two are separated lots of the primary colors are used (red, yellow, blue). For example his blue suit her yellow dress and red purse. But as they start to come together greens purples and oranges are used. In this video the sunsets turns orange and purple because they are starting to come together. The secondary colors are used as symbolism because they are a blend of the primary colors so it used to show them coming and blending together. If that makes senss|, Ryan Gosling was robbed of an oscar for his performance in La La Land and the main reason is he learnt piano for his face to look more natural while playing the instrument . He also danced and sang so well in this masterpiece.

It would be seen as another rom-com whereas the end turns it all around. Also that look they shared at the end of the movie in the jazz bar was everything. it summed it up perfectly.|, These actors did a fantastic job. You can tell they're not exactly veteran singers, there's visible roughness in their voices but that's ok, they're working with what they have.

Labor Day,Labor Day Extended Trailer #1 (2013) - Josh Brolin Movie HD,QOQL3Xi8dPE,1513832,4404,398,"I love how Kate Winslet never judges her characters. She always makes them whole and real, like she doesn't put a label on them. |, This film was amazing! 5/5! A must see! You actually feel for the characters (especially the Mom). The acting was outstanding.|, This was filmed two streets over from where I live and my best friend and I spent like two weeks creeping on the set and ended up meeting Josh. Beautiful movie.|, I don't typically enjoy the slow developing movies. But, this movie was deep and it truly touched my heart. At some point, I wanted to walk out because I knew that the only happy ending I could hope for was impossible. For me a truly great movie is one where I can't guess the ending and the ending to labor day was so unexpected. As one critic put it, this movie is more appropriate for Valentine's day.|, Escaped convict Josh Brolin could show up at my house anytime.  😂  I love this movie.  It’s one of those movies that I will watch over again periodically.|, If this movie makes me feel the way the book did, I don't think I'll ever be the same. Seriously though, there is soooo much more to the story than anyone thinks just by watching the trailer, A MUST SEE|, I love this movie. Thought it was a bit unrealistic cuz what are the odds of that really happening but still a really good movie. I love how it never actually emphasized or even mentioned them having sex. It was pure emotional love. 10/10|, I saw this in the theater opening weekend. It is a briliant film. Absolutely wonderful. Wished they made more like it.|, This movie has so much emotion. I absolutely loved it! |, Cried a lot throughout, some times due to sadness and sympathy, others with happiness. Defiantly recommend this movie, it was beautiful! Though the happy ending did leave me in tears!"
Lady Bird,Lady Bird | Official Trailer HD | A24,cNi_HC839Wo,20913860,159671,4032,"The mother daughter relationship in this is by far the most relatable one I’ve ever seen in the movie. The longing for something greater but the feeling of guilt that what you have isn’t enough for you. It was so beautifully portrayed.|, “Mom, do you like me?”
“Of course I love you.”
“No, but do you *like* me.”
That line hit different.|, this movie made me cry. especially the ending. lady bird's relationship with her mother also made me bawl, because I can relate to it, sadly. my mom and I used to not get along very well; we're fine now, but that aspect of the movie really hit home for me. loved her and Timothee, of course. <3|, I love it in the shop when they’re fighting and then they just find a dress and are all happy and nice, I feel like that sums up a lot of parent-kid relationships|, This is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made. So funny, deep, touching, relatable, and human.|, Is it just me or does an end of a good movie such as this makes you sad and empty, like a feeling of nostalgia of the times that didn’t exist, like you’re missing out on something, that somehow your surrounding seems different. I don’t know|, ""What if this is the best version?""

That really hit me hard when I saw the film. That's actually one of my biggest fears. I'm trying hard to be the best that I can be - to be the better version of me tomorrow, at least better than today. But what if, this person who is me right now is the best version? :'(|, ""But math isn't something you're terribly strong at..."" 
""That we know of yet""
Way to go girl! That's the right attitude :D|, this is the most relatable movie I've ever watched|, When she open the door of the car and threw herself i was like “thats a mood”"
Lady Macbeth,Lady Macbeth Official US Release Trailer 1 (2017) - Florence Pugh Movie,2Z0N8ULhuUA,3228199,21148,562,"So grateful to have been born in 1993 instead of 1793. Movies like these remind me how lucky I am to be 26 in 2019. Even being a woman in the 70’s was a lot harder than now.|, Watched this film, wanted to come and share that the trailer does not give away anything...the storyline is so much different and complex. Also, surprisingly good; highly recommended if you like Tarkovsky and Haneke...dark and enjoyable.|, I just watch it yesterday and it was a masterpiece for such a small budget. The acting of everybody, especially that of the lead character, was moving and makes you feel conflicted about her. I still can't get over the film. The ending makes me want to groan and scream in frustration. In the end, I finally managed a short, ""WTF"".   Definitely a very memorable film for me. Two thumbs and big toes up for me.|, you can tell that the budget was a little starved, but that hasnt stopped them directing and casting an amazing movie. It honestly look really good, lighting and everything is spot on. They have done a good job making something out of nothing, hopefully to make loads back from it.|, This is so much better than what the trailer made it out to be. Truly captivating, especially towards the ending. Loved it.|, The film explores the evil the bubbles below the surface of empowerment gone awry. You want to root for the heroine but as the film goes on you are like, “Oh no, not like that.... oh no!”

It is a marvelous film all in all. Florence Pugh is absolutely captivating in the lead role.|, Few films cause me to put my hand over my mouth and stare wide-eyed at the screen, but LADY MACBETH elicited such a reaction out of me. That said, I'm so glad I saw the movie before watching this trailer. Spoilers much?|, I saw this at Zurich Film Festival and it was absolutely stunning. The trailer does the film justice which I daresay is almost never the case. Go see it if you can!|, likely one of the most brutal drama films never seen before, that shows the terrible consequences of a loveless marriage and a secret affair, always with tragic  results, a piece of british cinema unique, with a style that make a very deep impact in the soul, although not with a precisely happy ending.|, Florence is perfection."
Lamb,Lamb | Official Trailer HD | A24,hnEwJKVWjFM,8643501,81200,6482,"This trailer went from unnerving, funny to full blown disturbing again. I love it!|, A24 is literally the top dog when it comes to production companies. They could have a movie about dryer lint coming out and I would be excited|, A24 is becoming very consistent and amazing at mastering the horror genre and proving that horror does not mean just jump scares.|, A24 really seems to love films with female protagonists going insane, nefarious farm animals, and flowery imagery; if someone burns to death it will hit A24 bingo. It's like Hereditary, The Witch, and Midsommar had a love child and I'm here for it.|, I hope the cat gets an Oscar.|, This film is definitely an metaphor for loosing a child, and grief. I can’t wait for it.|, I don't think y'all understand that A24 doesn't MAKE (most of) their films, they BUY them from film festivals and distribute them. Show some respect to the Icelandic filmmaker that made this, Valdimar Johannsson.|, that shot of the man holding the lamb-human hybrid in one hand and a shotgun in the other sends chills down my spine|, why can’t he just be a cute lamb that goes to school in his coat like paddington bear|, If you aren’t so familiar with the film style of these movies you may not like it. Hereditary was really good so went to see lamb and enjoyed it a lot. The ending and moral makes sense"

Perfect.|, Every 500 bad movies or so, along comes a movie like this one, and it restores my faith in humanity, and certainly my love for movies.|, Just watched this movie tonight.  Absolutely wonderful, it will touch your heart and soul. It made me cry but I loved the message it had.|, Very heart felt drama about life and death.

I've contemplated leaving everything behind since her death.  I don't know who I am with out her!|, This movie gutted me to the core! I lost my mother last May and this just really resonated with me... beautifully shot, beautifully acted by everyone involved! Hard to believe that this is Robin's first movie as director! Oh yeah.. and I cried my eyes out as well! Evertime I see it! Well done Robin! Major talent!|, Can’t believe this is already 1 year old!
Still one of my fav movies of 2021
Robin Wright is incredible here with her performance, the gorgeous vistas, and this did make me teary eyed|, Robin Wright is so underrated. Have loved her ever since I first saw her in Santa Barbara - I was just a little girl. 
So glad she left Sean penn and made a better life for herself. 
Looks like a film with depth and wonderful cinematography. 
So happy for her. ✨✨"

The lyrics, with their heartfelt reflections on love and heartbreak during the holiday season, resonate with me on a personal level. Each time I hear the familiar jingle of bells and the infectious chorus, I'm transported to a winter wonderland filled with memories of warmth, camaraderie, and the magic of Christmas. ""Last Christmas"" has become more than just a song; it's a cherished tradition that marks the beginning of the holiday season and brings people together in the spirit of celebration.

Beautiful, mesmerizing and classy. So glad this film is using her image and talent this way. Fits perfectly|, The fashions, the sets, the twisted story line, the groovy 60s soundtrack and those trippy, mind-bending visuals ... WOW! I utterly loved this.|, Finally, a college student in the movie who actually looks like a college student|, I’m glad Matt Smith seems to be getting featured in movies a lot more these days. First Morbius now this. Hope it continues, he’s incredibly talented|, Everything about this movie looks incredible. Edgar Wright is one of the best directors.|, I just watched this last Saturday night and was really impressed with the whole movie. Eloise starts out as a very enthusiastic / optimistic young person then has a hellish experience into a darker place. The cinematography and effects and composition of the scenes were great. Good timing and build up of the action to keep it intense and interesting. Nice plot twist. I would recommend it and I'll watch it again.|, People are talking about Anya Taylor Joy, yes she's amazing, but Thomasin McKenzie is insanely talented and underrated. She needs more recognition!|, Just saw this last night. Just amazing. My heart was pounding so fast through out the whole movie lol. It just didn’t let up. I recommend this being seen on the big screen. One of the most unique horror/thriller movies I have seen.|, First trailer was mysterious and thrilling, this one gives away too much information however… Still looks like a better than average horror film nowadays. The aesthetic is chef kiss. Don’t let us down Edgar!|, I’m coming back to this video to say that Last Night In Soho is a pretty good movie! I wish they could’ve explained more on why these visions Eloise has is a big part of her life. They make it a point earlier on in the film to show that she can see and feel things others can’t. More explanation would’ve been great! It would’ve added more important elements to the storyline but the movie is amazing! And that plot twist is literally *chef kisses* I couldn’t believe it! 

The movie itself takes the viewer, brings us along, takes the information we already know and fools the audience just like that! When I first watched this trailer a couple years back I was in love with how everything flowed together! The mix of horror movie elements and the incorporation of old school music in the trailer made my jaw drop! The trailer music was something that grabbed me! Amazing!"

Very good mixture of some of Hollywood's greatest actors coming up with Fun, Friendship, Romance and a quite serious, thought-provoking message in the end. I seriously didn't expect to think so then my friend got me in there, but can I totally recommend it!|, One of those feel good movies that makes you reflect on life.

They provide so much care for all of their movies and get so excited for the vision of the DIRECTOR, not what they can change the movie into.  I’ve read where they have meetings with the director of each film just so that they can grasp the director’s vision and provide a great distribution model and marketing scheme for it.  Each film is different, and A24 is one of the first companies to fully realize that!|, Such an incredible, well crafted and well acted film, gave me a reality check about being content. A24 never disappoints.|, Wow. What an amazing experience. This film really stays with you. When you see the *A24 logo,* you know it's going to be a good film. Great acting & the main character shows real resilience & restraint, throughout, while remaining so sweet, fragile & innocent, in spite of everything life throws at him. I had tears in my eyes at a few parts. If you're reading this & questioning whether to watch this film, the answer is _yes._|, I used to own this horse (Pete). His real name is Starsky. Was such an amazing horse, and still is. Ironically he would always lean on people when fed or brushed lol. I miss him a lot, but I'm glad to see he's a real star now hahah|, I find it amazing that Charley is in every single frame of the movie and that there are so few cuts. I mean, the second last scene, which is very emotional is uncut and quite long. Amazing acting and amazing filmmaking. Also love the song at the end and listen to it while running these days.|, I worked at the racetrack where this movie was filmed for 30 years. It closed down for good in 2019.

I decided to finally combat my anxiety and try for my license this year. I’m taking lessons but I didn’t feel like I was making any progress. This video helped so much. Thank you!|, I'm 18 now and I haven't learned to drive yet due to anxiety, that was only added to by a recent car accident, but now having no way to get to school learning to drive is my only choice, and seeing all of the people in the comments who have gone through similar things has been so insanely helpful.|, Hi, I am 37, never driven before in my home country, recently moved to the US and driving is really a necessity. So, thank you so much for this video, it is so helpful.|, Learning comes at your own pace! It’s great to see people of all ages wanting to learn.|, 20 year-old with autism & tourettes here.

Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist,Left Behind: Rise Of The Antichrist - Official Trailer,dFlu7dmHQ_g,749131,6010,2557,"""It's still so easy to dismiss it, even though we saw it with our own eyes"" what a great line. Indeed, we are so easily swayed even when it's right in front of us. Finish the race, saints, be strong; it's nearly over.|, Hoping it gets a physical release or a digital release eventually. One of my most anticipated movies of the year. Big fan of the series.|, After watching this movie, went to the restroom and as I walked to the sink to wash my hands, a lady asked if anyone had just seen Left Behind. I said I did! She was BEAMING as she said at the end of the movie, her husband of 8 years prayed to receive Christ! Hallelujah!! Neither of them will be left behind!|, And here I was JUST 10 MINUTES AGO telling my wife that I wanted to revisit the Left Behind movie because it's getting more real than ever before. Perfect timing! Our human life is but a vapor, a morning mist. It's hear and it's gone. But when we die, we go to ONE of only TWO places. Jesus died that and gave us free will so we could either choose to repent and accept HIM as both LORD and SAVIOR or to choose ourselves as LORD. We must al choose. Like Joshua who said, ""Choose you this day whom you will serve. As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD!""|, My only concern with this trailer is the quote, ""Cause I asked God to leave me behind."" I just wrote a blog about that very thing only a few days ago. Asking God to leave us behind to help evangelize the world is the same as saying that we don't trust that God has everything under control... that somehow our presence is necessary to continue spreading the salvation message after the Rapture. If that were true, then the Rapture wouldn't be necessary. We could all just stay to evangelize the world. But that's not what God has planned. God is preparing 144,000 converted Jewish evangelists PLUS He's sending the Two Witnesses. Yes, with our limited human intellect, it may seem logical to ask that we be left behind, but we're not thinking as God thinks. We think small. God has a wedding feast planned for us, and for us to say, ""You know what, Father? I think I can be better used here on earth during the Tribulation, so thanks, but no thanks."" Really? I know that the line is taken completely out of context, so I'm going to wait to see the movie before I make any judgments.|, Oh wow!! They’re actually doing it!! I hope they do the whole saga up to “Glorious Appearing”.|, Who else got goosebumps when he said isn't it easy to dismiss it even when we saw it with our own eyes?

Lemon,米津玄師  - Lemon  Kenshi Yonezu,SX_ViT4Ra7k,837007615,3090323,239333,"Everyone been wondering why Yonezu (last name) Kenshi (first name) is wearing the heeled shoes. In one of his interviews he said that once he dreamed a funeral. Everyone was sad, but suddenly someone in the first line started to whistle loudly, in a way that annoyed the other people. They all started to say that he wasn't respecting the dead person because he wasn't being in silence for him, but Kenshi knew that the man whistling was communicating with the dead one. That was their own unique way to recognize each other. Maybe the others will think you're crazy or something negative, but it won't change the love that the whistling man has for his dead friend. Turns out that Kenshi got inspired by this dream so in the sing he wore heeled shoes, because he wants to let us know that he doesn't care what others say, it's his special way to express himself, because Kenshi was affected by High-functioning Autism which brought him to be smarter than the average, but he couldn't handle with social relationships, that's why he never had many friends since a young age and everyone made fun of him because of his character. This made Kenshi very sad and from then on he started to hate himself because of his very uncommon name (in Japan there aren't many people that have Yonezu as last name and no one, but Yonezu Kenshi, is called Kenshi or the spelling is similar, plus it sounds like a stage name as well) he thought he was strange and weird, an uncommon person who shouldn't have existed (in fact in Japan there is a very strong will to follow the mass, which means if the greater part of girls have bangs, then the girls without bangs will try to have them or if they remain what they are, they might be isolated because different from the rest of the population). But Kenshi to make us, his fans, satisfied, he decided to collaborate with many people in the 2017 like the animators for MHA, DAOKO and Suda Masaki. He changed during his musical career, like the time he was still Hachi (ハチ) and he felt somehow lost in all of his fame, so he made this song wearing heeled shoes and then the next song, Flamingo, is very different from Lemon because many people started to listen and to know him after Lemon, but he wanted to know what they would think if Kenshi changed the rhythm and the kind, turns out that many of them were attracted by Lemon and they didn't like Flamingo, but they still subbed to Kenshi's YouTube channel. Thank you for reading all of this, English isn't my mother language so I'm sorry for the mistakes and as always, have a nice day :D

Edit: You can find a video summary of Yonezu Kenshi's life and all of his interviews, it's in Mandarin tho. I hope you have a good translator to understand what's he saying.|, 노래 좋네요~ 요네즈 켄시 화이팅!|, 流畅的钢琴和弦，惊艳的弦乐，另辟蹊径的旋律……这些组合在一起，令人惊叹。他真的是天才。|, 「愛」「友情」「家族」のどれでも解釈できるのすごい好き|, 光も影も暗闇も、この人の手にかかると美しいものになってしまう|, 当時の変わらない気持ちのまま聴ける数少ない曲だと思う。

Time.|, “The blood of the martyrs will water the meadows of France” line gives me chills. You can tell they took a little inspiration from the French revolutionary anthem la Marseilles|, Hooper made a lot of weird artistic decisions in this film but this was one moment where he got it exactly right. The way the song builds from silence to anthemic grandeur is so good, it's one of the best arrangements of it in the long history of Les Miz. Easily the high point of the movie.|, The actors in this scene are so good, even the extras. I could watch this a dozen times over paying attention to a different character as the focus, and you can see the calculation in the small body language movements, the resentment, the joy, the pride... Nobody wants to make the first move out of fear, and the song is just hyping everyone up to know 'We stand with you, please, make the first move, we will follow' until everything finally collapses and everything happens all at once.|, I love that one French soldier who was just like 'Why the hell not' and just joined in|, This song conveys the emotions of every communities from anywhere, which are denied their rights due to any reasons. What a song man👌👌|, I am Russian and I listened to this before going out to protest. And cried. And I was angry. Please stop the war PLEASE. Do you hear the people sing, mr President???|, This song brings me to tears every time I listen to it"

I love seeing Kevin Costner and Diane Lane together on the screen|, I don’t understand why the Academy Awards is not recognizing such a great talent like Diane Lane’s.

Both of them are more than spectacular actors and I hope Diane is going to get the attention she deserves, this woman is a treasure|, Absolutely fantastic movie.

He is now healed. How can I forget what Jesus has done|, I am a Chinese and have just moved to London studying for 2 months. I am a Christian all the time but when I first heard this song I was shocked, moved and touched!!! Although my English is not that good I can feel the power in the lyrics!!! Thanks to the God!!!|, When I cried out to Jesus...in college when I was desperately lost..I said, ""Jesus, if you are real, Help!"" He came to me and I had an experience like seeing a bright light at the end of a dark tunnel...anyway, I was never the same...I was radically saved and started reading the Word and attending a Bible Church. That was when I was 22...I have served the Lord in various ways for the past 45 years...taught Bible lessons, served in Christian schools for 8 years..undercover missionary in China for 14 years...played in many worship bands...and sang solos ....now I mostly write devotional poems to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ....He loves you very much...and He died for all of us..only Jesus can forgive your sins...and set you on a path to Heaven..John 3:16|, If you're reading this just wanted to let you know that God has heard your prayers and he has seen your tears,he is going to give you what you need

Let the Sunshine In,Hair - Let the Sunshine In,fhNrqc6yvTU,39262817,155952,13597,"I am 68 years old and I still cry everytime that I see this movie clip.  There are a lot of hidden messages in this sequence of scenes.  This song evokes so many emotions --- fear, despair ... hope ... and even enlightenment.  Pretty amazing!|, The visual of the soldiers marching into the black void of the airplane makes me break into tears every time. Brilliant cinematography and choreography.|, I can't watch this without crying my heart out. What a masterpiece of a musical|, Истински приятел!!!❤|, One of the saddest scenes in movie history, the music just makes even more haunting. RIP Treat Williams|, This song closed my mother's funeral service. It was one of her favorite movies. It was cloudy that day, but as the song was coming to an end the sun came out... Extraordinary experience.|, This musical is underrated. This ending cuts you so deep, so powerful. Its STILL relevant in 2020. You still see the shadows of the past around you in society..|, My husband has never seen Hair, so I’ve been playing clips to show how many popular bangers are from the musical. As soon as I started this one, I just burst into tears. May future generations live in a world where the young aren’t sent to die for the greedy.|, This just hurts my heart so much every time I see it.  So many boys I went to high school with were drafted and sent to Vietnam.  Some never came home and those who did were so deeply scarred.  It's impossible for people who lived through this time not to cry when they see this.|, One of the best movies! Great director and cast! And ending, after all this years still makes me so emotional! RIP Treat Williams!"

It just has the absolute PTA vibe, in every possible way and not just the lyrics. The Bowie style, how it captures the time, it is absolutely spot-on. I've always said that I've never seen a movie that captured the look of the '70s better than Boogie Nights, it seems that PTA has met his own standard once again. Lining up to see this one!|, I'm literally watching this trailer like every hour, this is what happens when you let creative people do the work and you don't stand in their way.|, Incredible trailer which I’ve seen countless times both online and in cinemas and I’m still watching over and over again even after seeing the film itself which tells you how good it is, it’s that good and the performances so believable that you just get caught up in everything going on, willing both of them on. The kind of film that makes you feel like your holding your breath in in anticipation the whole way, the kind of film of that is the perfect example of why I love the cinema experience|, Probably my favorite movie trailer of all time. Gives me unbelievable nostalgia for a time period I never lived in|, Watched it yesterday. What a great movie that just allows good writing, directing and acting to happen. There’s not even much of a plot to the story, just two characters living their lives and carrying out a complicated relationship. Great film.|, I’m loving how the two main characters look like people and not chiseled gods.|, Even Paul Thomas Anderson's self-cut trailers are as intoxicating and addicting as his films. I still rewatch his trailers more than I should. True God of cinema. The subtlety of this one is brilliant. Also I have fallen in love with HAIM.|, The editing of this trailer is so perfect… almost like a short movie itself.|, Wow, we just watched this on Amazon Prime and this is the best movie I have seen in years. And yes, it made me feel great and moved and we all laughed, without any Green Screen CGI special effects and over the top violence or grossness. What a breath of fresh air. Why can't they make more movies like this?  What a great Producer, Director and screenplay.  The actors were all believable and great, really great. Thanks guys..."

I said ‘Life Itself’, and he was like, ‘what?’. 
‘Life itself is a song,’ I said. Then he looked at me and became quiet.

I don't think I'll be uploading anymore videos either. But there are some other Monty Python videos on this channel that I uploaded at the same time back then, so if you guy's are interested go check it out. Have fun and Thanks.|, The fact that this type of comedy spans over multiple generations proves that this is comedy in its finest form|, Fun fact: The oldest joke ever recorded was a fart joke in Sumeria from 1900 BC. Humor never truly changes.|, fun fact:
The hysterical laughter you hear at 4:03 is the cameraman who lost his shit, because only Pontius Pilate, the centurion and brian knew about the jokes lol|, That double-take John Cleese does when he meets Biggus Dickus gets me every time.|, John Cleese's reaction after hearing Biggus Dickus speak was easily one of the funniest moments. Had to stop himself for half a second to just comprehend what was going on  like ""Are you real?""|, I saw this in a packed theatre in 1981.
The reaction was incredible. 
The Catholic Church in my country railed against it. 
John Cleese said they never made fun of Jesus, which was correct.
I bet even the Romans liked it.|, brilliant facial expressions, camerawork, perfect comedic timing and nearly breaking character by laughing make this such a brilliant sketch|, That pause and expression the guard has at 5:06 get me to start laughing every time.|, The part that always gets me is when the guard in the background drops his spear and doubles over because he’s laughing so hard.

4:14

Oh yeah.  And the people you first hear laughing in the background aren’t the actors.  It’s the freaking cameramen losing their shit and they broke what was left of the actors’ resolve."

You get to really know the people in this and what hurtles they had to jump through to get to sobriety.....
Addiction is a disease and you saw it eat these poor peoples livelihoods. 
I'm not going to lie, I shed many tears throughout this emotional rollercoaster of a documentary.|, I believe Freddie had a chance to stay clean. He had no support from anyone. The way in which he was treated by his parole officer was sickening.  Your asking a man to pay that much in rent who's fresh out of prison with bo experience.  Shame on the justice systems|, Wow this documentary was incredibly captured throughout the years. It was amazing traveling through time with Rob, Freddie, & Deliris. Watching how this addiction took over their lives. Witnessing how the system failed them over & over. Down to their location. Systematically built. Ultimately, it's up to the person but everyone needs proper support & guidance & it takes a village. This felt like an honor to watch.|, I remember watching the original one in the 90s and always wondered how they ended up. What an emotional roller coaster. Never transitioned from happy to sad so many times while watching a documentary. I feel like I know all of them personally now and what a wake up call it is to anyone with addiction.|, Just watched last night, and am still feeling whiplash from the emotional rollercoaster this movie put me through. The way this movie was made kind of reminds me of Boyhood, except it is 100 times more impactful knowing that these are real life people.  I had to keep reminding myself at times that this was a documentary and these weren't characters. Jon Albert masterfully chronicles the tragic lives of these 3 people in such a personal way that makes you wonder how he we was able to build such a close relationship with them, all while the camera was rolling. A 10/10 must watch!!|, I've already commented on this video, but just wanted to say: I really hope this doc starts getting the attention it deserves. It's hard to find critic reviews for it, of any kind...positive, negative, or in between. It really deserves to be seen and get some buzz because it's a God dammed accomplishment, and while I hesitate to call it ""entertaining"", I enjoyed my time watching it immensely|, My takeaway from this is the disproportionate ill effect’s it has on the children Deliris’s daughter was smart beyond her years the way she spoke & the answers she gave in response to questions regarding her moms drug use, and then we hear her tell her mum in jail that she’s scoring straight C’s in school that has to be down to the child’s home environment it’s utterly heartbreaking."

I wouldn't have done it without Shawn's inspiration! 🥺💕|, This song honestly makes me emotional as to how I never took the shot in school. I was always quiet and hesitant for all the activities that my friends suggested and all that lead me to was graduating empty handed of friends. I did get to express myself in acting classes and my friends saw potential in me, yet it still didn’t push me because I was too afraid of judgement.

I do regret being quiet. Wish I could travel back in time and maybe get to actually act like myself around them without restrictions holding me back.|, 2023 but still listening to this song, Always an inspiration.|, Dose anyone else think that this song would be perfect for a slow dance at a wedding|, I was 15 yrs old when this released and now Im 22 yrs old its crazy how time flies real fast especially in pandemic days. It makes me sad I wish I could go back and enjoy my high school days and not rushing to graduate. Enjoy your high school days guys because its the most amazing part of our lives that we could look back when we get older.|, Every lyric is a ""healing pill"" to shy people go out.

This movie moved me, not because of the sacrifice they made for their country or their government, but it brought tears because of the strong sense of brotherhood bond they all shared, the honor they hold on to & the length of sacrifice they would go through for each other. |, This was the first movie I've seen that I literally broke down in tears after I watched it. Never had a movie do that to me before. I'll never look at any soldier that's been to Afghanistan the same ever again. So much respect for our troops.|, I almost enlisted when I turned 19 but my grandfather who fought in the Korean War talked me out of it. Now I'm saving lives as an Med Tech.

Hands down my favorite movie of all time|, I'm so glad they turned this into a movie. It's such a great story. They did it right, too. Zero politics. If you love this country, it's a must-see -- no matter what your opinion on the war is.|, I am from Afghanistan, plz Americans don't hate us, the real hero of the movie is the villager who saved the navy seal, put himself and his family lives in danger. This is called humanity. It made me cry a lot.  There are good people everywhere in this world, even those people are away from education but still have the soft heart of a human.|, This is by far one of the best movies I've seen, and definitely my favorite war movie to date! The struggle these brave ass men went through is astonishing and tragic, and it will always be a story that I believe will define the navy seals for what they truly are. However you look at war, whether you are opposed or for it, there is no denying these brave men; no matter what branch of the military they are in, deserve our respect and gratitude for as long as America is around. |, Just saw the movie today and just to let you know Mark Wahlberg killed it.

Brilliant|, Just saw this movie and I was blown away! One of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, if not the best. An original script, lots of action and solid performances from Joseph, Emily, Bruce and the little kid. Definitely a must-see.|, Being a huge Sci-Fi fan I had to watch this film and I loved it! Brilliant, intriguing and intense story - reminded me other films like Millennium (1989), Freejack (1992), Timecop (1994) and The Time Shifters (1999). Anyway, it was unique in its own way. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt did a great job.
Looper is one of my favorite Sci-Fi films of the 2010's (next to Inception, Prometheus, Limitless, Tron: Legacy, Cloud Atlas, Daybreakers and Melancholia)|, It's one of the most underrated films ever... I saw it in the cinema with a few friends on the day it was released. The ending should have been slightly different because it probably deserved a sequel.|, I just saw this movie for the first time and I am not exaggerating when I tell you it left my jaw dropped.. Excellent movie and great ending.|, Does anyone else think the idea of a prequel to Looper would be awesome? It could show how the loopers came about and a little bit of Joe's backstory, or maybe a shorter prequel on the years in China.|, I love this movie so much. I watch it once a year and I""m floored everytime. I also almost can't make it through the whole movie because my heart breaks so bad for the kid.|, just watched this today for the first time with my boys at home and wow i did not expect it to be this crazy good. the film was a masterpiece|, This is movie is absolutely incredible. The acting is stunning, and the concept is gorgeously thought provoking. To those who criticize this movie because they don't understand it, please try to write a screen play this terrifically complicated while maintaing the continuity and see how that works out for you.|, Just saw this movie tonight and it was amazing. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was most prominent but the acting came from Emily Blunt and she displayed the full range of emotion. You really feel her pain and she is one of Hollywood's best imports in recent years."

Amazing trailer Warner Bros !|, I honestly don't care what the critics say, the directors they're comparing Gosling to are all my favorite ones and I must say he has fine taste in cinema. The trailer looks good and he deserves more recognition than the heat he's been getting. Give the man a few more years and a couple more films to give himself a brand. Mr. Gosling, you've just earned a new fan and a whole lot of respect.|, Cornwall, Ontario. Canada. A town notorious for being a recipient of the St. Laurence dam, which flooded many towns under water to make way for greater shipping routes and power generation. I can’t help but speculate that Ryan Gosling, having grown up in Cornwall, had some large impact on him to create this movie. I’m gonna have to add this to the must watch list!|, I've been obsessed with the soundtrack/score to this film for years now. Perhaps its time to give the movie a watch. Ryan Gosling is very talented. He was in a band I believe, and they made really, really good music. Guess they stopped, but anyway, he has a great eye and his aesthetic sensibilities match mine, so I'm gonna watch this. Hope it's good.|, Just saw this. I must say I do like it. Quite mysterious yet simple story. There is quite the bit of suspense throughout the film. Definitely an art house film, it's not for everyone. 
But there is indeed a story at heart here.|, I got to see this twice at Cannes. It's an odd mix between all of the directors he has recently worked with or admires (Cianfrance, Refn, Malick, Lynch, etc.) Even though it's not a masterpiece, I absolutely loved it. Worth watching for Matt Smith’s performance alone.|, So. Detroit native here. This is one of my, if not my FAVORITE hidden gem of all time. Ryan Goslings vision is incredible in this. The cinematography is unforgettable. 

Not sure how much traction this comment will get here, but are there any other hidden gems you can recommend??? Or soemthing in this same realm visually!!??|, This is so underrated movie, this is a masterpiece. Music, storyline and cast is all phenomenal! Finally great movie from crappy Hollywood. Ryan Gosling, you did great job.|, Beautiful and pleasant to look at the trailer, which at the first viewing recalls the evening in Venice, carnivals and river walks, and the second view draws attention to the fear and fearlessness characters.
I want to watch this now! :D"

So beautiful. It always gives me chills. Thank you, Brian!|, John and Paul performance are just like a perfect harmony. Warm , Riveting  and just captured the essence of Brian.
Thank god! For picking two incredible people to play this part cause I think they fit right it. 
Both part in Wilson life are different and I think they both did it perfectly no matter what people says.|, I've just seen this movie hours ago and I'm still blown away. Seriously, this movie is a masterpiece of narrative, acting and emotion. The whole cast is terrific, but Paul Dano gives one the best performances I've seen in the whole year. For real, he was snubbed by the Oscars for There will be blood but snubbing him away would be unforgivable. He gives such a real, complex and brutally honest performance of someone alienated and haunted by his own disease but also someone naive and innocent who's manipulated. It's a character you can feel real, you feel sorry for him but also you can relate to his pain and most of all you feel so powerless. You want to save him all the time and at the same time you can see he's a genius. It's truly a depth and unique performance that cannot be missed.
Same with Elizabeth Banks, always underrated, who makes something amazing with an ""easy"" role. She's not only the love interest, she gives her character a charisma and an strenght trought the whole movie wich also deserves a nomination. She really captures that feeling of trying desperatly to save someone you love, the frustation of being unable to do anything. Cusack is fantastic too, like a little, innocent boy in the body of an old, beated man. 
This movie is outstanding in so many ways, really shows what it is to isolated and misunderstood. The acting, the editing, the soundtrack...one of the best movies I've seen recently.|, As a Beach Boys fan, the scenes in the 60s are a treat to behold. It's like you're really there in the studio!|, Just back from watching this film, it devastated me, the film making was great the acting was great and it told Brian's story very well. I found it very emotional, exceeded my expectations.|, this movie was so incredibly amazing and heartbreaking. brian wilson is an absolute genius who was so mistreated and underestimated. i HIGHLY suggest watching this even if you don't know a thing about the beach boys|, I was a big fan of the Beach Boys back in the day (still am). I never knew Brian was treated so badly because I never got into their personal lives. I seen this movie and my heart was breaking for him. 😥|, Honestly I think this is the best biopic I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot, especially of rock stars. I was initially skeptical because of the Dano/Cusack split but the director explained it in a way that seemed brilliant --- basically the ""Paul Dano Brian"" disappeared when he ""went to bed"" (had his mental breakdown and became a recluse for years), and the person who eventually emerged from the heartbreak and wreckage was a different person, symbolized by the switch to Cusack as older Brian. We all know that Dano, already a phenomenal actor at such a young age, hits a home run here, nailing every aspect of the young Brian, his walk, his slouch (he was self-conscious as he stood 6'3""), the patterns of his speech. But I have to say that Cusack does some of the very best acting of his career in this film. I had forgotten honestly that he can act with such subtlety and conviction. He gets at the ""soul"" of the later Brian, a man who has experienced tremendous loss, in a more quiet way than Dano, and it is also brilliant and devastating. Banks is also excellent -- she conveys a tremendous amount of strength and integrity as an ordinary woman caught up in an extraordinary story.|, My wife hated this movie... I absolutely loved it. I appreciate music and am a huge fan of the subtle works that goes into making a beautiful song. This movie gave a first hand look into the amazing mind of Brian and what it took to grace us with such great music.|, I saw this movie for the first time on Christmas having some downtime and thought it was fantastic. Never was a Beachboys fan. I love biopics and after watching I started to listen to their music and appreciate the songs knowing what the suffering for their art cost them. I am a fan now."

I really hope this gets a sequel, it's really fun and the story has a heart.|, This guy is a brilliant actor. Hollywood should recognize that his talents go beyond PG 13 flicks.|, This move was way better than I anticipated.

This is just the start to hopefully a society of acceptance and empowering human beings. Thank you to the writers and 20th Century Fox for bring this movie into my and so many other peoples lives.|, This movie was fantastic. I publicly came out to my friends and family about a month ago, and I watched this the day before to motivate me. When the mom tells Simon he can finally exhale... I felt that. Seriously such a relatable movie! And so touching too. Now I can exhale with my boyfriend, publicly, just like Simon and Blue. :)|, This is one of the movies I would call a masterpiece. No over the top drama, no fetishizing, no stereotyping... Its one of those films you just have to watch. Every time you watch it it's always gets in your feels. Congratulations to everyone who worked on this movie. Its one for the generations.|, I cried at least 100 times during this movie because it took a toll on me.
I am young and figuring myself out.
I am a bisexual female.

Javier has done a great job, even down to the little smirk Pablo did with his mouth.|, Just finished watching it and it's a well made film with great acting n cinematography.. one of the best films about Pablo|, Holy shit he actually looks like Pablo. 

But they can't beat Narcos.|, Javier Bardem se acerca mucho al parecido físico  de Pablo, pero el que el patrón salga hablando inglés durante toda la película, destruye toda la magia.|, It’s going to be hard to top Narcos version of Escobar but this looks like it’s got a shot to be pretty good. Seems like a strong cast as well. Looking forward to watching it.|, No one will ever beat Wagner Moura‘s portrayal of Pablo Escobar in Narcos, he was amazing!|, Watched the 2 seasons of Narcos, id say pretty good. Watching El Patron Del Mal, its legendary. Im excited about this movie even tho its been a couple of years.

Years, decades later and this movie becomes a classic.|, No animations, drawn by hand by a hundred great artists.

In an art style that must have been a PAIN IN THE ASS to animate, and it looks absolutely amazing.They stayed true to Van Gogh's style.    and I am mexican, I live in Mexico. So don't pull the race card on me about under representation. The Book of Life also brought light to Día de Muertos and mexican culture and it's not being shoved down our throats. There is much more going on, Pixar always, always wins. Don't get me wrong, Coco probably had it's hardships while in production as well.

This one is INSANELY good and has twists you won’t see coming.|, Octavia Spencer and Naomi Watts in a thriller? I love it already!|, the trailer has me intrigued, so therefore I now must see this movie. Seeing what appears to be phenomenal acting in a short 2m41 sec clip has pulled me in as well. Octavia Spencer, Naomi Watts, Tim Roth are fantastic actors and the new guy ( I am not familiar with his work) seems to portray some genuine emotion in this role, I mean from just a two minute clip! I definitely want to see this! I have been largely uninterested in seeing many of the movies as of late but this looks great.|, Just viewed Luce and it was a great movie. I had to watch closely to really understand the reasoning in the movie with Luce and His teacher. But after viewing I can now clearly understand Her (teacher) side and Luce point of view...as weird as that may sound. Its definitely a great physiological thriller that forces you to see both sides of the coin. I highly recommend watching it...it was Excellent👍👍👍👍. The entire cast was superb to say the least."

Lupin III: The First,"Lupin III: The First [Official English Trailer, GKIDS]",6C2ZsWobs68,2085784,61063,3357,"Even if you don't like this movie, you have to admit; This movie is bringing in a big audience who didn't know what Lupin was before they saw the trailer and are now interested. I think that's a good thing.|, Lupin is always smiling because he knows he has plot armor.|, This has got to be the slickest change from 2D to 3D animation I've ever seen. The characters are so springy and stretchy and make impossibly quick moves, just like 2D cel animation. There is no compromise here. You can pause this video at any moment and see a beautifully composed frame. VERY WELL DONE.|, Did someone said that CGI in anime sucks?

I couldn't hear you over this epic trailer|, I love Tony Oliver as Lupin so freaking much! He always sounds like he's doing his lines with a shit-eating grin; which is exactly what Lupin the third should sound like!|, As someone who has never heard of this before, the Nazis really came out of nowhere|, OMGGGGGG!!!!! I e waited so long!!! So glad it’s finally coming out here!! I hope it’s good!|, Finally, the Japanese are doing 3D animation justice.|, I'm glad the original cast is back.  Tony Oliver knows how to do Lupin.|, This movie was everything and more I could've wanted for my first Lupin the 3rd experience, I only wish the pandemic hadn't made the cinema I watched this in so empty. This deserved a full theater!"

"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile","LYLE, LYLE, CROCODILE - Official Trailer (HD)",s0W6O7mSlaU,4375250,26296,1542,"“He can’t talk but he can sing”
Character writing 10/10|, This would work infinitely better as an animated film|, We've reached a point where featuring a scene where a person starts screaming and the CGI character starts screaming back should carry a 5 year jail sentence.|, Wonderful movie.  I have an 8 year old daughter that loves reptiles and struggles with anxiety at times and there couldn't have been a more perfect movie to enjoy watching with her.|, This definitely looks like one of the movies of all time.|, I've got to say: Most film adaptations of picture books typically only use the characters and maybe briefly reference the plot of the story. This one seems like it's basically the book plus a bit of music and backstory, which (as a fan of the books as a kid and an honorary children's librarian) makes me incredibly happy.|, The movie was adorable!!!!! It was the perfect movie to spend time with the grandbaby. Some things just need to be seen and enjoyed through the eyes of a child. Not everything has to be serious or perfect.|, Took my 10 year old niece to see this last night.  I was bummed she chose this movie because I thought I wouldn't like it.  Ended up loving it.  The message was about family and friendship. True Gem.|, Ever since I have watched the trailers, the songs are stuck in my head and I just can't stop singing. It's so catchy. Can't wait for the movie to come out and hear more of Lyle/ Shawn singing and songs.|, Some kids movies are annoying to adults but this one looks so cute, fun and imaginative that the parents will probably love it too!"
M3GAN,M3GAN (2022) - M3GAN Dances Scene | Movieclips,1c7XccFwJrQ,930239,6238,755,"I love that she didn't run, she power-walked to kill that guy.|, You could say that M3gan is slaying, literally and figuratively|, The dance has become a legendary moment at this point and I love it. 😂|, I think one reason the dance has become so popular is that Megan is really kind of celebrating herself here, discovering her new found independence and breaking out of her robotic persona. It’s a kind of testament to her freedom and there’s real joy in that. She’s essentially saying “look at me, I’m pretty awesome”! She sings…she dances…and yes, she kills. But it’s the dance that people remember about this scene. Megan proves to be quite the break out artist, and we love her for it!|, Absolutely iconic. Even though she's gone full demon mode, the audience is still rooting for her at this point.|, Literally the most iconic part of this movie💀. I remember when the trailer came out and this scene popped up I laughed so hard cause it was like “wtf is going on”. Thank god they gave M3GAN sm personality in this movie.|, This is hands down one of my all time favourite movies. I loved it. I don't usually like killer doll movies nor do I go to the movie theatre for horror movies but this one looked so good and I didn't wanna wait for it to be out digitally before I saw it so I went to see it at the theatre. One of the best movies I saw in theatres. I loved every minute of it. Very fun movie. Definitely one of my favourite movies of this year. Can't wait for M3GAN 2.|, I thought this movie would be stupid but I'm actually planning to watch it again. This dance scene has me laughing 😂 now I'm doing it|, My question is, how did Megan get behind him so fast? She was at least a whole hallway behind the guy in the previous scene. She was walking, not running. He was running at full speed.|, Fun fact: the dance was not in the original script. The director, Gerard Johnstone, came up with the idea on the spot."

I wish STUDIO4°C would do more like them.|, I can’t believe they took This off Netflix 😭|, I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH ❤|, I love this whole movie, but some reason the whole scene at 34:08 is one of my favorite scenes, tbh mainly because how smooth Shakespeare is. This movie wild but entertaining asf.|, Willy is just that one guy you tolerate but aren't really sure why.|, This movie is criminally underrated|, me downloading this from sketchy ass website later finding it on GOD DAMN YOUTUBE|, This movie deserves a higher rotten tomatoes score|, Such a underrated movie"
MLK/FBI,MLK/FBI - Official Trailer | HD | IFC Films,Lvfxzht9KUA,168927,1606,259,"Can't wait to watch this! Hope they mention how his demands for economic justice were seen as dangerous, not just his civil rights work.|, The FBI's real role isn't ""law enforcement"". It is containment of the population. A government of the people should be obedient to the people, not antagonistic to the point of physical harm. But that's what we have in the USA.|, And can we just stop and admire Mrs.King, her intelligence and how beautifully stunning she was?? 🙌|, He wasnt perfect nobody is perfect..but as long as he fought for people of colour to be recognised as humans..then I got mad respect for him..he dint sell his people out he fought for them...no huma in this world can be perfect we just choose to take the positive vibe in them and live out the negative vibe..I dont support his extra-marital affairs...that to me is just a perfect NO..but I can take his words of wisdom..his courage...thats what matters in the end...|, Happy Dr. MLK Day.
Happy Malcolm X.
May all peaceful people, (no matter how imperfect their lives may have been), continue to make strides in our divided communities.|, Going back to the past will hopefully enlighten others on how we got to where we are today!|, An outstanding and fascinating doc with many ""new"" insights about BOTH King and the FBI. Highly recommend.|, They knew he was the black messiah, so he had to go.. This man MLK shaped my life and inspired me to be a better black man everyday..|, They did the same with Malcolm X but were surprised and disappointed that they could find nothing inappropriate or undisciplined about him. In the end they begrudgingly conceded amongst themselves that he was a saint compared to others out there when  it came down to his religious and marital fidelity. Nevertheless they still continued to ferment deadly unrest between MX and the NOI leadership including sending counterfeit threatening letters, appearing to be from MX and his new movement to the NOI leadership. That false flag, cointel method was again successful for Hoover to achieve their illegal objective. By this time, the mob had already acquired compromising photos and details about Hoover's secret lifestyle (he was allegedly homosexual) that they used to keep him in check.|, Happy MLK day to this amazing man!"
Ma,MA - Official Trailer,eIvbEC8N3cA,12728278,93804,8711,"First of all, I'm rooting for Octavia. Second of all I love they took the safest person you could be with, a auntie type black woman, and turned it on its head.|, Everyone is talking about her being black, but I'm over here just insanely happy that Mrs. Spencer is finally playing a different role for once! She always plays the ""strong-independent sassy black woman"" in every movie she plays in. I'm excited to see her play another character, hopefully she does well.|, Don’t make me drink alone, don’t make me drink alooooooone! 😂😭 Can’t wait to go see this|, This was a really interesting movie. Octavia was seriously great in it. It's scary and fucked up and psychological but it seems realistic in a really really unsettling way. Unique take on horror.|, ""dont make me drink alone""
honestly, if I watched this movie I would be on Ma's side the whole time.|, great movie.. what a performance by Octavia Spencer, I've seen many movie sin this genre but she gave me chills!!|, Octavia is an amazing actress, very excited to see her do a film like this.|, Ma character is so relatable the pain never goes away. Sometimes I think of the most inhumane things to get back at my bullies or people who have done me wrong. Society never shed light on this|, Congrats to Octavia Spencer for getting this role. She's going to crush it. Looking forward to seeing it|, I don't know why but I actually liked this movie. Thought it was interesting and Octavia really delivered the suspense. Seemingly sweet and then turning a complete 180"
Macbeth,MACBETH - William Shakespeare - Ian McKellen - Judi Dench - HD RESTORED - 4K,IgEshHhnLqU,326284,4974,142,"I saw this masterpiece in GCSE English back in secondary school… absolutely blew me away. Was already a fan of Judi but this performance was phenomenal. Same goes for Ian and the rest of the cast. Absolutely fantastic. 
Thank you so much for uploading this masterpiece
: )|, Best version hands down, any fan of entertainment should see this at some point in their life.|, I cannot thank you enough for this beautiful upload of McKellen's Macbeth, I fell in love with it from a previous iteration that was since removed. Even the black box theatre staging creates a voidal effect, like a remembrance of tragedy or procession of nightmares. Can't overstate how superlative McKellen is, the mastery of the text and so utterly charismatic to the point of making one more than a little complicit in his intrigues; Dench's performance too is stupendous.

My complete gratitude!|, Absolutely fabulous. Studied Macbeth in my BA literature class and then taught it to BSc students at college.  Have loved it wholly.|, One of the greatest disappointments and regrets of my life. Our VIth Form English set (we were doing Macbeth for ‘A’ Level) had an outing to see this legendary production at the Young Vic. I fell ill and couldn’t go. Always hoped I’d get a ticket later but the run was over sometime in early 1978, and I never did. Delighted to see it captured here.|, Still my favourite production of any I’ve seen on stage or screen. I have nothing original to add to the various plaudits here, but on a facetious note I’d recommend giving it a watch sometime with the automatic subtitles on, which I’m doing right now. Watching the algorithm wrestling with ‘the Thane of Cawdor’ is great fun. Every version is different - so far I’m up to ‘methane of Korda’ 😂|, I saw this performance on a VHS tape - and have never forgotten it. The best Version of the Scottish play I have ever seen. So glad it's here to watch again. The performances are raw and intense, and the stark set seems to isolate and magnify the actors.|, I was blown away by this masterpiece. I remember watching this in my English  class when we were reading and learning about William Shakespeare's works. I remember getting a 98% grade.|, Watching Mr Ian play Macbeth so stupendously made me sympathise with the character deeply. He plays it so beautifully, with the correct balance of emotions. I view this play very differently now.|, Absolutely fantastic !!!  I studied  Macbeth during my English Literature courses and I can say that by watching this upload I finally understood the analysis and the overall comments!"

Please consider subscribing to support the channel!|, Fun movie and nice to think all those involved had as much fun making the movie, as I had watching it.|, Hilarious! Definitely a guy-movie...blood, guts and eye candy. Loved all the cameos...Lol..I forgot to mention, don’t be drinking when Sofia Vergara’s shooting scenes start near the end...you might spew it out laughing❣️|, Yay you guys!  Love me some Trejo Machete madness, been waiting years to see this sequel, thanks so much for posting up!|, Some indie comedy and quick James Bond action. Traces of Bollywood exaggeration as well.

Very hyped|, Any chance this will have a physical release? I'd love to have this on my shelves or in my grubby little hands 🤲|, This movie was so insane in the best possible way! The level of work and detail that Phil Tippett put into this film is amazing! It is clear that it was a passion project which he dedicated decades to and it payed off big-time!! I loved it and will definitely watch multiple times and hope for a physical release!! Again Bravo👍|, when creativity goes unchecked. it looks like complete madness and i love it|, Just watched it last night, and what a ride...It might just be madness itself; pure nightmare fuel. Definitely a lot to unpack...it's like a dark Nightmare Before Christmas, if it were a Nine Inch Nails music video, as directed by Terry Gilliam on a mescaline bender, but...not. It really is a singular, stunning achievement that has no precedent.

Grotesque, cynical, and disturbing. If you can get past the gory stuff, of which there is a plethora, you may notice an allegorical commentary on modern society, and the human condition, taken to the extreme. The thirty years was worth it. Hat's off to Phil|, I've been waiting for this one for a long time.  Phil Tippett is an absolute legend.|, This is amazing, as a stop motion animator of 4 years, this is gonna be my favorite stop motion film of all time. Way to go Phil tippet|, If you watch it as a whole, its one of the best films ever made. The ending is everything.|, I want to physically own this, not interested in only seeing it on a streaming service. I want to have this on my shelf and have extra behind the scenes content available to see.|, Definitely a movie I'd want to own, especially for Halloween."
Mad Max: Fury Road,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],hEJnMQG9ev8,36668935,159906,14026,"This is a trailer that gets better AFTER you see the movie because it reminds you just how overwhelmingly beautiful and awesome that movie really was.|, This is the only trailer that actually shows you the whole movie but no one complains because it's so fucking awesome.|, The sad thing is that we’ll probably never get to see another action packed & masterpiece of a film like this from the series.|, The greatest action movie I've ever seen. The colors, the aesthetic, the soundtrack, the acting, the script, the costumes, everything is mind blowing.|, My favorite movie. My favorite cast. Pure perfection.  Unbeatable in every possible way.|, I love when max said ""it's hard to tell who is more crazy. Me, or everyone else"" because Max was not the only one who snapped and went mad, there are thousands out there like him that went crazy. And I must say I freaking love this movie|, This movie makes Fast & Furious look like a hot wheels commercial.|, One of the best movies of all time. The plot is so professional. Also, one of the best--if not THE best--stories with a male and a female lead working so in balance and so beautifully without extra shit.|, Still feel sad for those who haven't watched this masterpiece...|, I remember seeing this theaters and left speechless. A masterpiece."
Madame Bovary,Madame Bovary Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Mia Wasikowska Drama HD,La-clCmfWGo,3506309,20435,857,"I'm so happy that Mia without being considered pretty by so many people manages to pull off some of the greatest women in literature on the big screen. She isn't afraid of stereotypes and is one of the few actresses who I deeply respect. |, Lost me when they called it a love story. Madame Bovary is about a woman that spends all her life chasing the impossible fantasy that love and marriage is forever passionate and exciting like her novels. In the end she neglects a loving husband, is a horrible excuse for a mother, and lands the family in an assload of debt all for her selfish desires. ""Classic love story"" my ass. :P|, Literally cried watching this... my favorite actress bringing to life one of my favorite classic novels. And God, in all of Mia's movies, she seems to be the most beautiful in this one!|, She is exactly how I imagined her to look from the book description. I can't believe it. Of course, the others a bit different, but that's exactly how I saw her in my mind's eye. Just amazing! Can't wait to see the movie!|, Though I'm not really one for historical drama/romances, it's great to see Mia and Ezra working together! |, I have read this novel because my favorite writer considers it fascinating so I have no choice but to read it from cover to cover. The book is interesting, not hard to read, but it takes time to understand the actions of the characters. Emma did not know what true love meant, she found life to be some sort of fairytale that was why she wanted to have  love, the second secret life. I should reread it, the book is absolutely awesome.|, Mia makes a fascinating Emma Bovary. This movie is haunting, sad and beautiful. The costumes, cinematography and production design are freaking gorgeous.|, I finally got the last chapter of Madame Bovary. Ema's death for me is a catastrophe. A great family drama. Poor Charles, her husband, who loved her so much and never really possessed her. The sudden and violent loss that separated him from a great love can not be overcome. The greatest joys in the life of a man have as their source the harmonious conviviality with the beloved woman. Death does not have the right to end this love so abruptly, so cruel!
And his father, a man so unhappy that the loss of a son and his beloved wife was not enough, now the ill-fated destiny separated him from his sweet and angelic daughter. An infinite martyrdom.
Oh, Bovary! Why did you inflict such pain upon so many who loved you? Forgive me for my ignorance and try to disqualify your motives, it is because of these countless joys to so many people, whose lament I make listen.
May the heavens hear my cry, may the stars not shine tonight. May you rest from your torment, poor girl, that from the earth sprout your most cherished and beautiful memories, that I may forgive those who have mistreated you so much, and that no one else suffer with such pain!|, Beautiful and haunting movie. Mia makes a great Emma Bovary. The book is a masterpiece - this is a different take on it for sure - more from Emma's perspective. This film uses visual imagery and color the way Flaubert used language - its very poetic.|, Mano, eu amo esse filme"

Good laughs, great scenery and I wasn’t bored - though, I thoroughly expected to be.  Surprisingly fun date movie!|, Oh my God !!! It has been a while since I watched a great movie , I just saw it today and it was amazing !!! Super funny ! I recommended!! I will probably watch it  again with my friends ❤️|, I can't wait to watch this. The duo of Toni & Monica on screen together is intriguing but please Bleecker street give Mafia Mamma a decent theatrical release and decent promotion. I hope it can be successful on the release date you choose.|, Very entertaining movie! I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. A light, funny, quick couple of hours, or however long it was (I didn't even check the clock because it never lagged and travelled well...and I always check the clock). Attention was played to detail, to artfully use the subordinate characters (the ""cousins"") in many individual moments to further the comedic mood. Well done. Good choices of focus, not overplaying the atomic family's purpose as her setup. Great turnaround on the usual ""romcom"" when the heroine decides meh, what was all that really all about anyway? Good move. And her new female confidante calls her mio amore instead. The editing was perfection. Each scene had purpose and did not overrun. For such a simple concept, they used their resources nearly the best way you could. It never set out to change the world, but in its arena it doesn't disappoint. Hollywood needs to use their playbook because this is how it's done. Imagine what could be done if this had been a script meant to change the world...what could have been made with these hands. Speaking of which, the film referenced Eat Pray Love a lot, but unlike EPL this film did not overdo the ""first life"", did not drag, was not melancholic and depressing, and packed a more enlightened monkish moksha (freedom) message even though it was set in a comedic version of The Godfather that it also so often referenced.|, I just saw this movie. It's hilarious 😂. If you're one of those people that likes simple easy to follow lightheaded comedies you will love this|, I'll always watch Toni Collette|, I would love to have this movie on Busy Moms TV, my husband and I watched it together and both loved it!|, OMG. THIS MOVIE IS SO FUNNY😂😂😂 I LOVED IT!!|, Watching this today! Monica Belluci aged so graceful my goodness 😍😍|, Loved it!! My new classic Comedy ❤"

Now that's dedication.|, God I remember this song coming out, felt like it came out yesterday.... it's surprising how much this franchise has changed us.. heck, it's the main reason I got into other fandoms. This song is an absolute master piece, this game has changed all of our lives for the better. Great job.|, The moment Dawko beat 50/20 mode will always be burned in my memory. Cause damn.
No, he wasn't the first.
But it was still a mountain he climbed and conquered, and that scream of emotion at the end of it all was his scream of victory.|, Scott: what if you lose?
Dawko: what if i win?

Scott: I'll give you an interview?
Dawko: deal. * beats 50/20 mode * hand it over.

Scott: danm this guy is good-


This song hits so hard after Scott retired...|, I can't describe how hype it was to watch Dawko's streams playing 50/20 and I'll be honest at times I was really worried about his health 
However he did it! The interview was the best ot could've been and most of all Dawko took a break after it! 
Thank you Dawko for putting so much work into everything you do consistently for so many years
Coming back to this song is such a nostalgia trip|, Thanks for having me again! Always a pleasure! :)|, One of, if not my favourite songs by Dawko! 
I love the 3/4 beat which makes it different to the other songs.
Great lyrics, great melody, great drums, great animation.
I will give it a 20 out of 10!|, Let's take a moment to appreciate how this is so well animated|, This song literally gives me motivation to keep going. I listen to this song before I play any game because just the memories of watching dawko beat 50/20 and the interview with Scott makes it even better and a dopamine explosion thanks Dawko and Scott I'll be a fan till I pass."

In the animated version, she looked fit to be a 22 year old and it just seemed highly impossible for a 16 year old to look THAT beautiful at such a young age. I'm just saying...|, I feel so bad for Maleficent. I thought the movie was great at developing her character into something that can be identified with among the modern audience. Although it's a shame a lot of the mystery surrounding her is gone, it's really empowering and heartwarming to know the 'truth' behind the story :)|, I truly love this scene, though it's super gut wrenching.  The way Aurora says ""No, don't touch me, your what's evil in this world, it's you."" It was so hard because she truly loved her as a person and yet couldn't understand why she had kept a secret and gave her a curse like that. Poor thing, and I didn't know how Elle Fanning would deliver as Aurora but she sure proved me wrong and I can't see anyone else anymore doing her (especially Angelina as Maleficent...like seriously she was BORN for that role).|, Love this scene. Elle brings properly vulnerability to the scene.|, They have GOT to make a trilogy out of this series! Jolie is devouring the part of the bad girl and loving it!"

She just seems like a  person with feelings.|, The story was so good and the visual beauty was so pretty. 
Maleficent's motherhood toward Aurora was so touching.|, I find it super interesting to see things from Maleficant’s point of view. This film looks terrifyingly gorgeous.|, Ignore the reviews. The movie is absolutely fun and entertaining to watch! Angelina Jolie is sooo good in the movie and the costumes are just stunning.|, I loved every second of this.

I hadn't heard that when I first saw that movie, but I already felt that's exactly what made her performance so wonderful.   Lily said she'd never felt so empowered as when she began rehearsing, dancing and singing with Jessica and Alexa.  The 3 of them rocked this.

This movie speaks to people who have dealt with grief. I absolutely loved this movie.|, I didn't cry while watching this, but Casey Affleck, his performance is outstanding, you know, not everyone bawling the eyes out while facing loss, his character is that kind of people who not open easily, and hide his truth feelings inside.

Can't describe how good this is so moving and touching. The unique story, the little society and the acting holy shit Casey and Lucas killed it. Please watch it if you havn't this really sets the new bar in terms of drama.|, I just watched this on Amazon.  It's beautiful and heartbreaking; such a good movie; made me cry buckets.  I loved Michelle and Casey in this.  Wonderful performances by both of them.  I hope they win Oscars for it.|, Just saw this movie a couple hours ago and honestly I was just blown away. It was truly an absolutely beautiful movie.|, I feel like Casey Affleck is just SO underrated. He's a brilliant actor, he's so natural in everything he does. to me he is already in the ranks of giants.|, the dialogue and the performances here are just incredible, i don't think i've seen a movie dealing with this kind of subject matter yet feeling so real. everything is imperfect, lines are never written just to be smart or heroic or fall into other cliches that make them feel like only someone in a movie would ever say. it helps the plot hit you really, really freaking hard. phenomenal piece in my opinion|, A movie hasn't made me feel the way Manchester by the Sea did in a long long time.

Seems linear, yet very, very weird. A must see for everyone that likes the cutting edge of cinema. This is classic Cronenberg, as usual, with none or very few peers, and his best since eXistenZ. If you love Hollywood or loathe it, you have to see it. It's a true love letter to the film industry.|, Mia as Agatha is my favorite character from any film. An ""angel of death"" unintentionally. Her intentions are not malicious, she is essentially innocent yet her mere presence sets into motion the total collapse of a powerful Hollywood empire. anyone notice as the film progresses and things get more and more intense that her burn scars start to show more?

In a different way, angle and point of view.

It is so beautifully written, and so beautiful to look at. Watch this movie, if you can. It's so...it's hard to put into words, but I felt something when I left the movie. It was worth it. If you get the chance. Watch it.|, This movie was as good as Your Name and A Silent Voice (and I say that as a fan of both). It was absolutely amazing.|, I cried my heart out watching this movie.

Or that it actually looks seriously, sincerely good.|, The fact that this movie can make fun of itself and also be an actual cinematic masterpiece at the same time is very impressive.|, I'm so proud of the success Jenny Slate has found through Marcel the Shell. She really picked herself back up after her slip-up on SNL and she's still doing funny stuff now and didn't let that define her career.|, I watched this movie with my mom because we were both feeling sad, and it made us both cry. Beautiful and adorable movie, absolutely worth the watch if you need a good cry and a reminder that there's good in the world.|, I honestly cannot believe a 2-minute trailer of a stop motion shell with little shoes and jiggly eyes could make me completely bawl my eyes out the way I just did. I am so gonna watch this film.|, The conch shells may look a little bit weird but they’re also cute at the same time. I feel like this has to be one of the most creative stop-motion films I’ve seen in a long while. Stop-motion is very, very difficult to pull off, as far as I know, especially in a feature-length film. I know this is gonna be wholesome. Kudos to everyone involved in this production. Y’all deserve so much credit.|, I watched these videos on repeat with my first kiddo who is now a teenager. And now I just shared Marcel with my 8 year old who is officially OBSESSED.

“Yeah.”
“When you bring me out, can you introduce me as Jesus?”|, Unpopular opinion here, I love this movie! A lot of people are pointing out the romantic portrayal between Mary and Jesus, but I did not see it that way. I find their relationship very unadulterated. To me, the portrayal of their relationship here transcended carnal desires. I also enjoy how the movie makers made Jesus' miracles and supernatural happenings look realistic and simple. It made him and the experiences of these characters much more relatable. I think the core message of this movie was beautifully conveyed. The message being, that faith is personal which is something people tend to forget. Perhaps I don't see anything wrong with the movie because I am not a Christian and I never was raised as one. Ultimately, this is a movie about humanity and spirituality, rather than a Christian doctrine and that is okay!  It has a good message!|, When you've watched a film 10 times and still the trailer gives your goosebumps, then you truly understand how great the film is.|, Beautiful film. 4 stars from Ebert. And perhaps the greatest demonstration of the spirit and humanity of Jesus and the kingdom I have ever seen. Truly and deeply moved me.|, I'm barely religious but I must say that this film was one of the most beautiful I've ever seen and the soundtrack was gorgeous. Rooney Mara did an amazing job at playing Mary Magdalene and making her seem so real. This film really made me realise how Jesus - though divine and the Son of God - was really very human and how deeply he must've felt for those and the world around him. 
I loved it.|, Joaquin Phoenix.......the man

who played a young boy who idolized Luke Skywalker who got launched in space by accident
A deranged Emperor who has a thing for his sister.
Mel Gibson's little brother who swings away.
A singer who has internal demons

A man who died for our sins
An broken soul in a broken city who slowly loses his mind.|, The way he took on both the divine and human position was both phenomenal and heart wrenching... I absolutely loved it ... this and the young messiah are both phenomenal... JESUS LOVES US ALL ...|, I really enjoyed this movie. It really shows Jesus and the burden he had to carry throughout his life not only at Crucifixion. Also the true meaning of the Kingdom of God. Amazing acting from Joaquin. Thought it succeeded in what it set out to do. Good Job. Can't understand all the criticism. I see nothing blasphemous about this film. There is nothing that goes against the character of who Jesus was. It is a portrail and it was well written and executed 🙏🏻🙌🏻|, A beautiful, arresting movie. Rooney Mara,  Chiwetel Ejiofor and the always compelling Joaquin Phoenix, are amazing. Rooney Mara is riveting. Chiwetel Ejiofor is awesome and heartwrenching and Joaquin Phoenix is incredible, best screen version of this Holy Week story.|, A very subtle and beautiful movie.

My dad watched the first Mary Poppins movie when he was 5 years old and he’s now 59. He started crying 10 minutes in to Mary Poppins Returns and afterwards all throughout. He said the resemblance between the two movies took him back to when he was a little boy, how everything was so new and exciting to him. 

I don’t care what the critics have to say, this movie is wonderfully spectacular and even if you haven’t seen the original it will still make you cry.|, After watching this movie, I can say that it’s definitely worth it. It’s my favourite movie now. It’s absolutely amazing|, I just turned 31 and watched this a few nights ago and it made me feel like I was a child again.. it was so happy and brilliant but somehow I cried. I loved it so much after renting it I went and bought it. I loved the acting, the story, the music and the magic. True Disney at its finest.|, I saw the movie and I loved it. A little girl sitting in front of me in the cinema said ""this is true real disney"". She took the words out of my mouth. Congratulations, it's a masterpiece.

From the music to the hand-drawn animation everything looks like it is remaining true to the original. Amazing trailer!|, Fantastic and magical! All of the actors were amazing and the music, the animations, too. There's nothing like seeing a film and feeling great afterward. Thanks, Disney and Mary Poppins Returns!|, I was reluctant to watch this movie knowing it wouldn't have the outstanding Julie Andrews. However, I just came back from giving it a chance, and my oh my, what an absolute masterpiece. One of those movies that every single person should watch just to remember the beauty and light of life in such a darkened world. The acting was phenomenal, and the music tugs just as hard at your heart strings as much as the original did... Just remember to bring a box of tissues! This movie is absolutely amazing!|, Watching this trailer brings back so many memories. I remember I was sitting watching the oscars and I had been waiting for this trailer to premiere.

Ronan’s performance was wonderful to watch. Robbie adds such a light to the film as-well, the costumes were so beautiful done and the cinematography was on point. Just by the first shots of the film you are intrigued, even if the film isn’t historically accurate it does do its justice, very nice really recommend it :)|, the way Margot says “your inferior?” gives me chills|, Saoirse Ronan can do absolutely any accent in the world ! A great actress. I hope she gets nominated again for an Oscar for this role. She is so talented.|, I loved this movie. Saoirse was hypnotic. Yes, nothing happened like it’s portrait in the movie so just see it as fiction. It was an amazing fiction movie.|, I just watched the movie and found it very good and entertaining. 
It looks beautiful and dramatic with the Scottish landscapes and weather, the castles, the dark rooms lit with all the candles and lamps, the fight scenes, but particularly the way Mary and Elizabeth wear colourful(and theatrical) clothing yet the supporting cast wear dark or black ones. 
The two women in the lead roles were excellent, especially Ronan. Both played well the dual  and contradictory roles of being women yet queens, people of power. The scene where Mary leaves her son James behind(and with no guarantees of the future) was very moving and affecting.
I take the point about the historical inaccuracies of having Mary and Elizabeth meeting in person(iportrayed in a highly artistic manner), the former's accent, etc. but this is a film meant for entertainment purposes, not a scholarly documentary.|, Mary actually spoke witha French accent rather than a Scottish one since she grew up in France|, I never get too mad when they portray  them meeting tbh. As long as the dialogue is close to their letters and the vibe of their relationship is the same is all that matters to me. I feel like producer’s do this bc it’s more interesting than just watching two ladies write back and forth to each other. Plus them meeting gives me some weird closure bc I always get so sad when I remember Elizabeth never gave Mary her wish to meet XDD|, The thing is, i dont care how historically accurate this movie is. I like the idea of these two queens coming face to face, it'll be fun to see how it plays out. Plus the acting looks amazing!!|, What an amazing movie. Saoirse and Margot totally KILLED it!!|, „When you murder me, remember you murder your sister. And you murder your queen.” Wow... just wow. This is so powerful it gave me chills."

A movie for all the family!|, Where's Joel Edgerton heading, I am too. He's so underrated and deserves more recognition for the works he does.|, Can't wait Joel Edgerton is one of the most exciting actors making some of the best choices of characters. Love him and Schrader going full tilt|, Its ridiculously sad that Hollywood never found a superstar spot for Esai Morales. He has always been a phenomenal actor, no matter what role he played.|, Can't wait. Gotta love Paul Schrader!|, Omg this looks so good. Most gardeners I know, do it for the peace in this chaotic world, yet they typically are the most dangerous people in the world. Their gardens are their sanctuaries from this injust world.

Highly recommendable.|, New Paul Schrader movie is always a treat|, JOEL MERECIA BEM MAIS RECONHECIMENTO"

Time time time time time.|, It does not matter which side you are on; this war will be heartbreaking and heart-shattering. It's all *fire and blood.*|, 00:29 Absolutely love this shot.

Si certains craignent comme moi je craignais que l'humour soit trop différent de l'humour des sketchs, c'est pas le cas, on a un film génial qui respire le palmashow! :D|, Je ne m'attendais pas à ce qu'un film de deux heures passe aussi vite, j'ai passé un super moment tout en légèreté. Ce qui était vraiment appréciable c'est que tout était cohérent et qu'il n'y avait pas 20 rebondissements improbables comme dans beaucoup de film français (qui rende le film interminable). Maintenant il va falloir en sortir un deuxième ;)|, Passer de Youtube a la Tele puis au cinema.. la classe|, Je suis allée le voir plus pour remercier le Palmashow pour tous leurs sketches que par le film en lui même. 
Et se fut une énorme surprise ! Un excellent film ! La nouvelle Grande Vadrouille <3|, De loin le meilleur de leur film, une très grande commédie française qui n'a pas été récompensée à se juste valeur. Rien moins que la grande vadrouille du 21eme siècle.|, Un des seuls films français que j'ai hâte de voir :) !|, J'ai regardé hier le film au ciné et c'est vraiment bien ! La bande annonce choisis vraiment des petits moments qui nous donne un aperçu du film mais en vrai c'est pas du tout ça :D Vous cassez les clichés et beaucoup d'humour à répétition pourtant ça marche. Très surprise de trouver des guests ou même Golden moustache, ça apporte un plus. Le duo est génial et la façon d'introduire l'histoire est aussi amusante avec des retours au présent comique :D 
Bref j'ai aimé ! <3|, Je suis allée le voir hier soir . Bilan : J'avais pas rigolé autant depuis un moment  !!!! (et la salle s'en ai donné à cœur joie aussi ! ) Un film drôle, loin d'être lourd sur la longueur et touchant par son côté ""familial"", on sent la bande de potes investie dans un projet commun. Ça respire la bonne humeur !
Ce film est un pur héritage de la ""Grande Vadrouille"" à mon sens, ça fait du bien de revoir une production comique de qualité et qui deviendra sûrement un grand classique dans quelques années ! 
Merci pour ce bon moment et bravo à toute l'équipe !|, J'ai eu l'occasion de le voir en avant première à Metz et franchement j'avais pas mal peur qu'ils se ratent. Les mecs ont fait du très bon boulot, allez-y si vous en avez l'occasion!"

Maybe I Do,MAYBE I DO Official Trailer (2023),xzJpwD28Cqs,1019386,9335,186,"This movie was one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. At first I thought it would be a silly Romantic comedy. But after watching it I realised it was actually deep and filled with so many life lessons. Each couple deals with the problems that people face in today's society.
There's the young couple. One wants to commit for the rest of her life and her partner fears that committing to her could change their lives the way his parents lives changed. He looks at his parents and sees how they dislike each other but due to marriage they stuck with each other. 

There's the parents of the girl. Their relationship has its own problems. The wife feels disconnected from her husband and wishes she could have more emotional intimacy. Then there's her husband who is blind to his wife's needs, wants and emotional desires. He himself has inner problems, he feels his life is nearly over and he hasn't accomplished enough.

There's the third couple who happen to be the other set of parents. The wife is adventurous and wants to try new different things, whereas her husband lives in  simplicity and shows love in soft ways and seeks love too.

All 3 couples are portrayed with all their problems and solutions. 

This movie has so much too it. It's truly amazing how the characters were well developed. How the storyline has so much too it. And how our main characters show us how much we are affected by family. 

This movie is for those who seek more to themselves. Hopeless romantics and the opposite of hopeless romantics. It's beautiful and has so many beautiful meanings.|, This movie was so good and made me realize a lot about love, marriage and family relationships. Like I know it’s supposed to be a silly rom com but parts of it had me in literal tears. It has so many life lessons if you’re willing to watch and really focus on what they are saying / portraying. If you enjoyed this you’d probably also like the Hating Game :)|, A Emma Roberts está simplesmente ganhando meu coração fazendo essas comédias românticas! Keep going queen!|, I'm soo glad to see emma back with the fun movies again like it's made for her!|, They are really giving us a crossover between Holidate, Pretty Woman and Shameless, love it !|, Dang I wished this was a sequel to that Hollidate|, This was a great movie to me. It will be nice if they make a part 2. I would like to see more of these characters. ❤❤❤|, Loved the movie! Great writing and great acting!|, I loved seing Susan and Richard together on screen again! God how I loved Shall we Dance!!!! And Diane and William on the same cast? This is gonna be amazing!|, ""Clueless parents' giving advice to their children - when they are 'clueless' themselves - works as a comedy/drama most of the time! Seems like the *best casting* here - hope the script's not predictable!"

You are a real soldier and I appreciate you for your diligence we need more people like you out here 💯✊🏿🤜🏿🤛🏿👊🏿💪🏿😎|, I just want to say, Thomas is really good at sliding through closing walls and doors 😅|, Thomas showing his middle finger to Janson was the funniest moment in the whole movie|, Since they got out of the maze, I figured the meat of the story was over, and thought this film couldn't be as good as the previous one, but it's even better.|, i’m so glad your not one of those people who say it’s the full movie but when you click it’s just a 2 hour long video with random images of it|, what I love about him is that he records whole movies with no interruptions|, This was the only one of the three I could not find for free on any streaming service.

You shown a light, it’s currently 10:30pm and I have work tomorrow. However I need more answers and my friends and I are here for more answers. Thank you|, Thomas has some bravery that I definitely don’t. In the Maze Runner he runs into the maze to help 2 people he doesn’t know that well. Later in that movie he leads a whole group to battle grievers and escape the maze. In the scorch trials he has some nerve to flip Janson off and escape the facility. He and his friends run around in the scorching hot desert to try and find a place where they can be safe, all ran by Thomas. He never gives up no matter what problem he is facing. A hoard of Cranks? Beats them. Losing his best friend Chuck? He pushes through and still try’s to save all of his other friends. None of them have their parents with them or really nobody to save them yet Thomas is like the dad of the group. He pushes through the toughest of problems to save his friends. He has lost so much and he doesn’t want his friends to suffer the same pain. I’m not going to spoil any hints for the Death cure because people NEED to watch the whole series. They really need to make the movies for the Kill order, The Crank Palace, and The Fever Code. It’s exhausting."

Fun romp this one and Michelle Yeoh is stunning as ever, she and Stanton pair so well she would have been better in the lead imho, and Tommy Lee rocks his role superbly and looks like he had fun with this role.

Here's what you need to know"" as a framing device to deliver historical education feels like a perfect recipe and I'm elated someone else thought of the idea and then actually had the expertise to *make* it. 
I hope this continues.|, This is a brilliant premise for a historian to use as a gateway to educate on any historical period. You MUST do more.|, I don't think any other video made me truly internalize that the past was a real place with real people and not just words in a history book. 
Great job!|, I love how he doesn’t break character and he acts like we are seriously going on this trip.|, As someone who is travelling to medieval Europe, this video has helped me a lot.

training & showing our dog Dee Dee. When I was 15,
my father gave her to his girlfriend without me knowing.

Megan didn't join the military due to whatever reason the movies says, she joined because of 9/11.|, I've NEVER connected to the final line of a trailer more than this. I see myself in Megan and Timber in Rex and I'm sure many pet owners feel the same about their own.|, I feel like this movie is gonna the best movie of the year.

There should be an entire album with these two. I've never heard a song that made me feel different emotions  (excited, happy, addiction trapped, and that feeling when you get your high), experience 3 types of different genres, and have an absolute understanding to the song. Even the video was epic and translated the song so well!
This deserves awards.|, This has become my ""go to"" song! To lift my spirits from the grips of depression.  I love you both!

Definitely one of my favorites of his!|, Man does this hit the feels.. couldn't believe that there's a song that actually hits me like a brick but this does everytime. I've been going thru some stuff and this song says it for me. When depression has its death grips around you feeling trapped and wanting things to end all ya want to do is say ur peace and go.

So well played AJ ❤|, Kenny was going for the world record speedrun of worst imposter.

How can  you do this?
This is outrageous. It's unfair!
How can you make an MIB movie... and NOT include Will Smith?!|, They should've added a scene where Will Smith helps them with their work|, Its not Men In Black without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith|, Chris Hemsworth still unable to forget his job as Thor. That's why he was very happy to see the Hammer. And alo thrown it on the face of the villain but alas! The hammer isn't so powerful like before 😉😄|, 50% of the comments:
*""Look it's Thor and Valkyrie""*
Other 50% of the comments:
*""Where is Will Smith??""*|, Everybody’s asking for Will Smith, but nobody’s asking for Tommy Lee Jones? 
Poor Agent K. 😞🕴🏻|, I always wanted a movie for Thor and Valkyrie.


Let's hope Loki also jumps in|, Im genuinely excited to see a revamp of this series especially with a power couple we already know!!! I was afraid Marvel wouldn't give them the time they deserved.|, I expected MIB4 to be Will Smith training a rookie like Jones trained him."
"Men, Women & Children","Men, Women &amp; Children International TRAILER (2014) - Ansel Elgort, Jason Reitman Movie HD",DS7uc8OF6Rs,2125091,16064,500,"just watched this movie and it was absolutely amazing, the trailer doesn't give it justice. the writing, the acting, the story, every thing is perfect 10/10|, I was sobbing near the ending and to me, it is very relatable. This is honestly the best and most inspirational movie I have ever seen. Definitely recommend.|, I saw this movie recently and was quite moved by it. I think it explores some key issues that come along with internet use that many people are either not aware of, or do not talk about. They gave each storyline enough time to develop and ""conclude"" itself. As well, I love how they slightly connect with one another, somehow. It is similar, in a way, to Disconnect, which I saw a few years prior to this movie. They both deal with internet issues and have separate, yet connected, storylines. I feel that you cannot really say one is ""better"" than the other, because the issues explored in both are quite different and important on their own. I think everyone should watch both this movie AND Disconnect to get a truly unique experience.|, This came on for the first time tonight and I had no idea what I was going to see or what it was about. I absolutely LOVED it! There was something very magical about this movie. The characters and their relationship just seemed so real and the music was really fitting.|, This really is a brilliant movie! Depressing in one way in showing how shallow and spoiled technology has made us. Yet, also uplifting that it can unite people who really need to talk to one another. Somewhat like a Desmond Morris/Nat Geo documentary with the narrative voice over for the first part. And needs to be seen on a large screen or up close to catch all the text messages that appear on screen. But all in all, whether one's up on all this internet hoopla, modern lingo and acronyms or not, it's a thoroughly insightful movie. Pulling no punches on sexual desires and failures, the fragility of emotions, and the dark paths we all take trying to 'fit in' with everyone around us. Much respect for Jason Reitman on this one, and I think Marshall McLuhan would approve as well.|, I love this movie this shows you thats parents arent always right and they really have to listen to their children and understand why therye feeling the way theyre feeling|, I love this movie so much. It's one of those that you keep thinking about after you watch it.|, im not gonna try and argue as to why this is one of my favorite movies of all time or if it was good or not, or if some other movie was better. it has nothing to do with social networks or the way we connect with people. this movie really goes deep and it hit home with me.|, This movie looks very promising I hope it's as good as I think it will be! We certainly need a movie with a different plot dynamic and serious tone and mentality. Can't wait!!|, This film is absolutely gorgeous♥️ Acting game, deep, problems, everything is stunning"

I pray one day this horrific act will end. Sadly, greed is always an issue 😢|, It's an absolutely phenomenal movie. Full of love and friendship. Whilst, simultaneously giving a dark glimpse of human greed and cruelty to differentiate itself from a fairytale. ❤|, What a phenomenal movie! Watched it by chance and blew me away… seen it about 3 times since. Great every time 👌👍|, Beautiful movie that hits straight to the heart. Absolutely Love this movie!!|, What a beautiful movie. This just happened to fall onto my lap recently and I was blown away. Definitely pulled the heartstrings|, I  watched this movie 3 year's ago and still know its masterpiece|, I’m watching this trailer and I’m crying already …what  a beautiful friendship… I’m watching this movie tonight|, It was a beautiful but bitter in the reality of what it describes. How an old legend by the local People helped saved her and the Lion and changed others. At the end of the film they showcase the drama of the collapsing Wild Lions Population in Africa down to 20,000 from 250,000 a century ago. The film describes Canned Trophy Hunting and is very brutal at times. A must see for maybe fans of Kimba The White Lion too.|, Freeing that lion means leading him to his death, making him a target for hunters. Sometimes survival is better than freedom.|, reminds me of ""we bought a zoo""❤️"

I first was wondering why the other dude didn’t get in trouble for stopping in the middle of the hallway or other things he did. Then, it hit me. As soon as it did I felt the tears rolling down my face. Then, I cried when his sister asked him to stop the trouble. Then, I cried when I saw the picture of the family and when the mom said that Leo was gone. Then, I cried when he was reading the letter. Then, I cried when the girl asked about Leo. Then, I cried when Leo went away in the space ship. Then, I cried when they kissed.|, 1:32 As an artist myself, that moment not only breaks my heart, but it enrages me to no end and makes me _really_ look forward to when the principal gets what's coming to him.|, I cried because of the Leo part, it reminds me of my dead great grandma, I still to this day imagine she's with me everyday|, I cried so much when I saw the part when the girl asked who Leo is. I felt so bad for Rafe|, I'm actually really excited about this new diary of a wimpy kid movie|, Nobody warned me that I would cry during this|, This book came out when I was entering middle school. To this day, my favorite author is James Patterson and I've read almost all of his books. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW EXCITED I AM THAT THE FIRST BOOK I EVER READ FROM MY FAVORITE AUTHOR IS BECOMING A MOVIE!|, I saw this movie a few days ago and I definitely recommend everyone who is interested to watch it! It was really good.|, I absolutely loved this movie..... I really don't get why it got a rating of 5.8 on imdb. It was awesome and really touching|, i'm so glad they didn't get 20-something year old actors for this"

It taught me how to become a wise, considerate and overall a better person. This is a masterpiece. Master, one miso soup please.|, this show is so heartwarming and relaxing. I hope netflix continues to pick it up and airs the rest.|, The only series I've never fast forwarded the intro, so beautiful. The stories are so close to heart 🤗|, Midnight Diner is like stories from a place I’ve never lived in or known. Yet it still somehow manages to feel like home.|, I know I am 5 years late but I have to say this is a Master piece! This is the only opening song I do not skip! The whole series felt poignant and nostalgic of memories I did not personally experience. Love the whole vibe of this series!! Its heart warming and easy to watch!|, Love this series. It's so simple, yet so beautiful. Great stories: funny, emotional, humane. It's so easy to watch it all in one go and then repeat it again and again. The soundtrack is great as well, lovely tunes to settle you in.|, I really liked midnight diner, the stories were so human and universal.|, I have absolutely fallen in love with this show immediately.
I recommend it to anyone who is a night shifter or bar goer.
It's sweet, funny, and hits so close to home of what it means to be a regular at your favorite spot.
If you don't have a family, or like the one you do have, find another one. Make your own if you can.|, It's one of the most beautiful opening songs I've ever heard. I love the series, and also the song. I've learned so much from that series. I'm going to have a shop like this in near future.
This song is better than every relaxing sound. Thanks for this beautiful song.👍👏👏👏👏|, The series just arrived here today in Netflix Germany, and I must say it is absolutely great! It has the potential to restore trust, hope and believe in human mankind with ease and humor. Love it."

In my opinion darkness is such a cliche and it’s refreshing to see a director who is willing to completely avoid using darkness to personify fear. Purely the cult itself that makes this film so suspenseful.|, A beautiful movie of a girl who after losing her family, travels to the beautiful countryside of Sweden, making new friends, finding a new family, and learning the true meaning of life.
10/10 would watch again.|, You know the Director nailed the job when the horror movie can trigger an anxiety attack and extreme terror even if it's all white, bright and full of flowers.|, Florence's acting was phenomenal in this. So talented.|, Other horror movies: ☠️🧛🧟🎃💀👽

Midsommar: 🌞🌻🌸🌈✨🌺|, This is how a horror trailer should be done! Unsettling music, no spoilers, unsettling imagery presented in a creative way, and best of all, NO STUPID JUMPSCARES.|, I will never forget sitting in a theater watching this and I look over to see a mom who brought what looks like a 11 year old son. The look on her face was priceless...|, I’m Swedish and i can confirm we do this everyday.|, It’s a shame that the Academy Awards simply ignores horrorgems like Midsommar and the Lighthouse. Outstanding cinematography and acting, especially Pugh:"

Millennium Actress,Millennium Actress - Official Trailer,2u5Ee1_jUCY,169492,2854,95,"Of all the animated movies I have watched, this movie has moved me the most. I have watched it around 10 years ago and was impressed by the story, animation, soundtrack and emotions. It's a movie I keep close to my heart.|, This film has been considered a contemporary legend and a masterpiece years before the Sensei left us. That should tell you all you need about its value.|, The animation of Satoshi Kon with the music of Susumu Hirasawa is one of the most divine combinations possible|, This and Perfect Blue are already two of my favorite films ever made. I only heard about Satoshi Kon this year after getting into anime movies. But it’s never too late to witness his incredible filmography. 

I of course love these two movies on their own. It’s just the way they are connected by Kon saying they are like “sisters” is what keeps me obsessed with them.|, A 20 años de esta excelente película, ojalá Satoshi Kon estuviera vivo para ver como se ha añejado una de sus más grandes obras, y una de las mejores películas del anime en la historia.|, Satoshi Kon-sensei was truly a master

All of his movies are masterpieces, his one anime was great showcase of stories he always wanted to tell, and even the other projects he worked on are amazing. 
Whether is be his script on the first segment of Memories, Magnetic Rose; his work on the legendary Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure OVA(yes, I am not joking), his contribution to the legendary film Akira and so on.

I still remember the day when it was announced he had passed away and I felt like I had lost a great friend too soon.
I had not seen any of his work till that point but I knew about him and just from interviews from anime magazines(yes I’m that old) and looking at the various stills of scenes from his movies, they had a very unique feel and he loved what he created. And due to anime distribution companies here in the states we’re starting to disappear, I was scared that all of Satoshi Kon’s work would be lost forever

But now, all of his movies, his one anime series, and most of his other work is widely available for all to experience and too keep his memory alive for generations to come|, I loved this movie. It reminded me of the movie Paprika which seems like the same people made this movie too. The music and animation is brilliant 😍|, What a beauty, amazing movie. The plot the way they move through time using movies it's like japnese history and movie industry move through time at the same time it's her own story that's unravelling in those movies of her chasing that painter.|, The last mainstream traditionally animated movie to be inked and painted by hand onto cels. 👍|, One of the best movies (animated or not) that Ive ever watched."

My heart is broken, yet so full at the same time. Thank you for creating a film that shows our stories!!!|, i have never ever cried this much during one movie. it was truly beautiful, it wasn’t overly tragic or made extra dramatic. it was very real. this is one of my favorite movies i have ever seen for sure|, Congratulations to Minari on its 6 OSCAR NOMINATIONS, including best picture, best director for lee isaac chung, best actor for steven yeun,best supporting actress for Yuh-Jung Youn(the grandma), best original screenplay and best score!! Very well deserved!|, This is not just Korean. It’s relatable for every Asian, African, Latino American,  etc living the “American dream”. Very emotional trailer.|, The trailer itself already got me emotional . My children need to watch this film so they could fully understand what their grandparents and their parents had to overcome by coming to a foreign country.This film speaks to all Asian-Americans and a reminder that a family strength lies in their hearts .|, I couldn’t stop crying at some scenes, as the son of immigrants, this hit very close to home. From the score to the editing, film was absolutely beautiful.|, Seeing this trailer made me cry so much. My life, while not rural, was much like this. With no asian role models in the 80s I hated being Korean and slowly even forgot most of the language and was mean to my grandma that loved me and raised me. Now I'm so proud to be Korean and trying to get to my roots. I'm sure I'm not the only one.|, I became Korean drama fan about 10 yrs ago. I've been watching the brilliant talent of Yuh-Jung Youn (grandma) since then.  She has dozen and dozen of films in her port folio and every single one of them she is brilliant in her understanding of her characters.   I hope she wins, she certainly deserves it!  It was a great film.|, This is not just Korean, it's too relatable for an Asian. This is living an 'American Dream' for an average Asian family.|, Minari is a reflection of what my family and I experienced. My family and I moved from Los Angeles in the late 80's to northern Mississippi. More specifically, it was to operate a small grocery store in a small, country town. Being Chinese American and not knowing the locals there, it was a culture and lifestyle shock for me."

But I recommend you do watch it. It's so touching.|, My favorite part is when Jennifer Gardner is giving the speech at her church and shows how the little things we take for granted makes everything possible, like the receptionist at the hospital talking to the doctor, Angela taking her day off from work to hang out with them, or the airline guy giving them the flight tickets.  Truth is that the spirit of God is within every single one of us, and when you do something good for someone else, you are helping God create a miracle in someone's life!!!|, This movie was so close to home. My daughter has an extremely rare genetic disease and we related to this so much. The feelings, the constant chasing specialists with no answers, the moments where she wanted to give up because she’s so exhausted. And the struggles in our faith. I loved this movie even though I bawled through it. God doesn’t waste anything. He will use my daughters story for good, even if she isn’t healed miraculously like this girl was. We have already seen enough of his protection and provision  in her life that can only be called a miracle.|, Me and my husband watched this with our 3 kids one night for family movie night. It had me and my husband bawling our eyes out. My oldest son couldn’t finish watching it, because it bothered him seeing that little girl go through all that pain. This is such a good movie, very touching. This is based on a true story. You can find the news article online talking about her falling into the 30 foot tree. Jesus is real!!|, I just saw this movie for the first time tonight at church. It is a gut-wrenching and ultimately triumphant masterpiece. And the cast was top notch. Everything about the flick was well-done. I got choked-up from both heartache and joy more than just a few times. It was beyond awesome.|, I just finished watching the movie just now. It strengthens my faith in God. It moved me. I cried at the part where Jen told the nurses that her daughter was healed.|, I just saw it yesterday, it's amazing! It's a powerful movie. It's full of emotions!
To all you guys saying that the trailer spoiled it, you're wrong. there's more to the story then you know!|, I legit cried through this movie. It’s very touching and shows how God is ALWAYS there for us.|, I saw this movie years ago, and it's still my favorite movie to this day. it's so touching. and for people who are saying that the trailer spoiled it all, no it didn't. there's so much more to the movie. I love this movie and i'm watching it right now❤️❤️.|, ""he told me i'll be fine...""

i don’t like how much they changed, but if you remove that aspect of it, then it’s a good movie as it’s own thing|, You got to give this film credit for being a Tim Burton film in which he takes a break from using Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham Carter for once.|, Man, I don’t know what it is but I love this movie so much. For me, this is my favorite comfort movie, I really wish the sequels didn’t get cancelled because of the box office performance. I know the movie is completely different than the books but they still made a great movie. Anyone else fans and still watch today?|, I'll be honest, this movie will stay in my heart forever. I have seen it few years ago, now I watched it again. 
I just can't help it, it is beautiful for me. 💜|, Eva Green is as remarkable as ever . Give her an Oscar already|, Imagine getting cast as the invisible kid.. Lol what a bummer|, Love this movie, for me what makes it so interesting, is that it feels like I'm participating in the adventure with them. I wish my life could be like this, even if it means living in a time loop.|, One of my favourite movies..
the story,the thrill,mystery, fantasy,the sound effects,amazing cast, old times vibes....
a wonderful movie💓|, Am I the only one who’s a fan of both the books and movie? As long as you can separate them, they’re both really good."

Please consider subscribing to support the channel!|, This film was so well done. There’s nothing Chastain can’t do. She was incredible in Miss Julie and managed to elevate action in Ava.|, I just finished watching this and the comments directly below are exactly what i would say  -  This is a great movie and I loved Jessica Chastain' s acting.  Very well written , superb acting all around, and a thought- provoking storyline. I loved every minute of it and I highly recommend it.|, I've never had anything good to say about VVS films but this one is... wow, out of the park amazing. Perfectly written, intensely performed, powerfully shot. It tears down a bunch of stereotypes while telling a captivating story. Exactly the opposite of modern Hollywood fluff, which reinforces stereotypes and feeds off them to make their storytelling job easier. Kudos to VVS and everyone involved in making this. I want more!|, An incredible, thought-provoking and inspiring movie that reinforces that even in the darkest of moments, there's always a way out if you listen to your gut instincts - especially if you're in a business where your life or profession might depend on it.  Mere mortals can achieve a lot when they put their minds to the test.  Needless to say, but definitely worth mentioning, Jessica Chastain, Mark Strong, Sam Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg, David Wilson Barnes, John Lithgow and so many others executed phenomenal interpretations of their characters.  A memorable and complex movie worth watching again.|, This is the most interesting , thought provoking , cerebral film I have seen in a long time.It is fast paced and surprisingly twisted,magneficient.Thank you VVS for such a jewel of a film.I'm glad I subscribed.|, It's been a long time since I've watched a movie this good.|, Jessica is a phenomenal actress. I love how perfect she fits in these rolls of being a Woman of Power and Wit! My all time favorite film of hers being Molly's Game. And she's absolutely gorgeous too! Lol|, Excellent movie 🎬 Fantastic cast with a storyline that is relevant today in 2022👏|, Great movie.  Amazing performance yet again for Jessica and the rest of the cast."
Miss Stevens,Miss Stevens Official Trailer 1 (2016) - Lily Rabe Movie,UM8MH53IRHg,910281,8795,387,"Timothee and lili in one movie? thats what i call MASTERPIECE.|, Absolutely loved this film, it was so heartwarming in such a clumsy- but charming way. I don't even know where to start, but like what Billy said you just pick a place to start and go off from there. There were many times in this movie where tears would drip down my eyes, because not only do I feel for the characters but it also reminds me of my true experiences similar to the characters relations with the teacher that it almost felt as if it was a mirror to what it has been like for the past few months. I felt every bit of it- every small notion to hide what you are truly feeling, the struggle of being happy and being sad as well, every inch of grief and unplanned but comforting joy. Every character in the end is lovable in a unique sense. You come to see that everyone is going through something, some in different degrees, but all binded by pain. It comes off as unfiltered, a true telltale of life. No character Is perfected, but shown all good and flaws which make it their own imperfect inheritance of beauty. I couldn't ask for anything so touching to watch late at night. There are something's in life that are just unwanted, but learned that were needed. Thank you for all the ones who came together for the film- it was truly magnificent. Everyone just adds to the story in a wonderful way. And for my own Miss Stevens- I love you too.|, Yes, I watched this movie on Netflix, because I loved Chalamet's performance in Call Me by Your Name, and here he stars alongside actresses from American Horror Story and Riverdale. While Call Me by Your Name touched me, I don't know, something about Miss Stevens hit me even harder. Maybe it's because I've never necessarily experienced love & heartbreak like Elio did; I found myself feeling sorrier for Billy, because he's a young teen suffering from depression, and there's this scene - without giving much away - where he tells the woman he's formed a bit of a connection with, how his medication just makes him feel numb, but at the moment, he feels great. I also happen to adore stories in which teachers bond with their students. This has pretty much cemented my love for indie films.|, This movie reminds me of the relationship I had with one of my elementary teachers. There was a group of us that were so close to her. We knew her kids and everything. We would stay after school to help her with her work and we would just play around. It was great. She is, to this day, the best teacher I have ever had. She would make us feel so comfortable to be ourselves around her. That was a great two years. (She switched from a 3rd grade teacher to a 4th grade teacher, so I had her two years in a row)|, I've known about this movie for a while and that it had both Lili and Timothée in it 😍 I thought it wasn't worth watching then I heard everyone talking about how good it is. Then I looked it up AND IT'S GOT PRETTY HIGH ROTTEN TOMATOES! I need to watch this today. Can't wait. ❤|, Lily Rade and Lili Reinhart in ONE movie. My heart is full.|, Timothy Chalomet is going to be a HUGE star... my God his performances are SOOOO AMAZING!|, ""a breakthrough performance from Lily Rabe""
SHE WAS ALWAYS A FUCKING BADASS ACTRESS. you critics just weren't fucking watching.|, More stressless movies like this with Timothee or just someone who dont have to act happy, the world will be a good place.|, i'm a sucker for timothee chalamet."

No green screens, huge studios, just pure action sequences on the ground on massive panoramic places...Respect!|, This guy has been in the zone(no pun intended) since Top Gun. Still number 1 after all these years. Thank you Tom for your service.|, Tom is 61 years-old. The fact that he does these dangerous movies for our pleasure is INCREDIBLE. Tom if you’re reading this( which you probably aren’t reading this because your busy making great films, but if you are), I have been a fan and a supporter of Mission:Impossible since, the first movie came out in ‘96(even though I wasn’t born yet). Keep doing what you’re doing. On behalf of the fandom, we greatly, respect, love and admire you and your work. Keep at it.|, Dirt Bikes, Aircraft, and a Mission. This looks awesome!|, This is the best movie for this year hands down. Waiting for the second part.|, This movie is an absolute blast, start to finish. Fallout is still my favorite entry in the franchise, but Dead Reckoning right behind it. Luckily I didn't watch this trailer before watching the movie, because the train scene is so awesome and that zero-G moment literally took my breath away. I wish Part 2 is the last Mission to feature Ethan in the leading role. I hope it provides the epic conclusion to the Ethan Era the character deserves.|, Nice movie and wonderful story 😊"

The man is a true daredevil, a perfectionist, and genius when it comes to his movie stunts and production. He risks his life for the audience.  The Mission Impossible movie series is probably one of the greatest series in action movie history. He is a legend. Never forget that.|, This is arguably the best trailer for a movie I've ever seen. I remember seeing it for the first time at the theater and instantly feeling hyped for a series I'd never watched. The next day I started the series SOLELY because of this trailer.|, 4 years later, with the new trailer just out, this is still the greatest trailer ever made|, 3 years later and WOW the nostalgia has permanently placed this trailer in my head. Perfect song choice, and the auditory cues of the punches and other sounds hitting right with the beats of the song was so satisfying 🤌|, Normally sequel movies arent as good as the ones before it, but with Mission Impossible they all seem to get better and better each time|, I watched this movie several times already, but sometimes I just gotta come here to re-watch this masterpiece of a trailer.|, 5 years later and I’m still getting goosebumps from watching this and wishing it would come back to theaters!!!|, This trailer is honest to god amazing, years later i’m still coming back ❤"
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation Trailer,gOW_azQbOjw,14947639,39659,2914,"This trailer is among the best I've seen in a LONG time! Music, clips selected, brilliant!|, Outstanding.  Unpredictable at every turn.  This cast is dialed in really well - love that they keep Ving, Simon, and Renner.  The MI series with Cruise never disappoints.|, Back here after rewatching Rogue Nation yesterday: the best movie of the saga hands down. For some reason my favourite moment has always been Ilsa saying ""now what brings you gentlemen to Casablanca"" (amazing reference to Ilsa Lund, made because Tom Cruise thought Rebecca Ferguson looked like Ingrid Bergman)...
Ilsa Faust (the name Ilsa alone is fascinating), what a superb female character she was (and Solomon Lane too is my favourite villain of the saga): so skilled and badass, so majestic and charming (those eyes and those legs suddenly became iconic), and still so human, deeply emotional and tragic (you can literally see in her eyes the emotional scars left in her soul by the lonely, desperate life of the rogue agent: always alone, with no cause to fight for or hope to believe in, always hiding in fear just to preserve a life that isnt worth living anymore, basically not even being a human person anymore but just an hunted animal (no surprise many in her situation turned to the syndacate just to have a place to belong again)...once you are emotionally mature enough (i have to confess i wasnt the first time i saw Rogue Nation back in 2015, cause i was just 15) to understand how deep her character is under that aspect (probably the deepest the saga ever got with a character ever) it's impossible not to feel the heartbreak of her being forced to betray the only man showing her friendship and comprehension, of her desperate proposal to Ethan (flying together), of their last hug and generally of her helpless need to feel as a human being again: just look at how beautiful her smile is while preparing the operation with Ethan and Benji, being able to finally feel as a part of a team again), by far the best thing Mc Quarrie brought to the franchise (you can really tell the man who wrote that character won an oscar for best screenplay, and the casting is the most spot on ever in the saga together with Pegg as Benji: she was even basically unknown at the time, so she was Ilsa Faust and no one else). I'll never forgive them for writing her off as the last of side guys (from all the awful stuff of the last movie this is the one they are more gonna pay for: just look at what a flop the movie was, and the next one is gonna be worse...i'm certainly not gonna spend my money to see the ending of that crap): shame on your damn ego Tom Cruise, I hope this will help you to recover from your self-infatuation and to understand your daring stunts alone are not enough to make a decent movie.|, Tom Cruise is 52 now, and yes, that is him on the side of a plane thousands of feet in the air.

Say what you will about his personal life, but you gotta give mad props to Cruise as an actor and a stuntman.|, Major props to Tom Cruise for actually wanting to do his own stunts. It really makes you respect him as an actor more and really care about the movie and his character more since you know he was actually in possible danger during filming. It also goes to show his passion for real stunts/action.|, Loved this movie! Every scene was badass. And I especially loved how both Ethan and Ilsa kicked ass  and not Ilsa being the typical woman who needs to be rescued because she can't defend herself. These MI series just keep getting better. Only finding out now that Tom Cruise does all his stunts. Bloody impressive.|, This is the best Mission Impossible movie|, WHO ELSE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE?!|, Just remember, Cruise was really on the side of a plane. That's why I like and respect him as an actor. He doesn't phone it in. He was really on the Burj Khalifa in MI:GP. In MI:2 during the rock climbing scene, he as really doing it. He had a thin wire to protect him that they digitally edited out, but the whole thing was real.|, Absolutely amazing movie. None stop action from start to finish with Tom Cruise at his best.  10/10"

Huge props to everyone who participated in making this project happen! Insanely cool to hear Elsie and Nola reprise their roles as Mommy Long Legs and Poppy for this song. 
Thanks for creating this. We all loved it!

-The MOB Games Team|, In my opinion, Poppy Playtime is a well developed indie horror game, with a lot of potential. So much work is put into this game, that its almost impossible not to believe why it takes so long for each chapter to come out. I haven't actually played either of the game's chapters first hand, but I've seen enough to understand that there worth playing. The game has unbelievable visuals/animations, great voice acting, clever mechanics, and overall interesting story. And I understand that its not as popular as other well known indie horror games such as: F.N.A.F(Five Nights at Freddy's), or Bendy and The Ink Machine, but that doesn't mean that its not worth checking out...|, This song inparticularly sounds like a song that'd be used for a movie trailer; and I absolutely love it.|, I love how this has both a relaxing and eerie feeling to it.|, Elsie and Nola, you are such talented voice actresses and I loved hearing you sing!

I love your Poppy Playtime videos that I wanted to react the most please. Especially I got Mommy Long Legs official plush doll.|, CG5 is the mommy long legs of bangers|, the fact that no one is talking about 1:34 and the fact that he was able to incorporate the tune of the itsy bitsy spider. . . that part is absolutely SICK. and then the line ""wash the giant enemy spider out"" just 🤩 loved the reference there too lmao|, Wow! the unique chords in this song gives me the tingles, also the amount of intensity in his voice here --} 1:45 , just makes the whole song way more intense, good job charlie!|, Though I'm six months late, I would just like to say this:

The ending of the song, when Poppy sings Mommy's lines. It has this sadden feeling, knowing that Mommy is now dead. The lyric ""Hush my love, my darling, Mommy's here."" just sounds so wrong with Poppy singing it. The feeling of a type of guilt, or possibly regret. It makes you feel like you've just murdered somebody's mom (which you've technically have, Baby Long Legs does exist), and somebody else singing makes it sound so wrong. Like they've just pushed the knife harder."

It seems like it would be stereotyped but it's really not; it's HILARIOUS!!|, This was a GREAT movie! I laughed so hard and then it had a  wonderful message. All Mother's need to watch this. Thank you for making such an awesome movie.
 Look for all you movie hater's. It's a MOVIE! As a Mother it wasn't about putting a Man down as you all are saying, it's about how a Mother feels at times in her life. You can't appreciate it, cuz your not a Mother, chill. It was great funny
humor and made me laugh sooooooooo hard. Great Job making this movie!|, This was lots of fun. But, it was both Mons AND dad's night out.

Money Monster,"Money Monster Official Trailer #1 (2016) - George Clooney, Julia Roberts Movie HD",va-0o_xBVnU,2643217,10083,882,"So excited to see this. Love seeing Jack O'Connell growing as well. He was such a great actor and always takes on really demanding personalities in his roles (even disturbing if you have ever watched Eden Lake). I remember seeing him on Skins. He was the best actor skins had actually had in their show. Of any season.|, This looks REALLY GOOD. Apart from a tag team comprised of two Oscar winners and the movie being directed by another Oscar winner, the plot looks wonderful, how the ""villain"" really isn't the bad guy, finding a thread, seeing where it leads and how it all ties together. Intricate plots like that are hard to come by, and whether the guy lives or dies, and because he seems to be a character we can all relate to in one way or another, this movie could be extremely interesting and should be good. I'm definitely gonna give it a chance.|, I'm so excited for this! I know it's gonna be great, aside from the actors because I got teary eyed just from the trailer.|, We need more movies like this.|, George Clooney is a legend and Jack O Connell is a very underrated actor so i'm looking forward to seeing this one looks like a decent movie|, One of the best movies ive seen this year... the suspense was crazy!|, Only Jodie Foster can produce such an amazing film! Can't wait !|, George and Julia's chemistry is always enjoyable, no matter the movie.|, This movie was surprisingly good. Highly recommended if you're randomly looking for something to watch.|, this is a awesome movie. this is one of george clooney's best performance in my opinion. the story is good and the acting is good. i like the idea of them showing how crooked wall street can be and how it effects people. this is a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do  rating 5/5"

Also high respect to Pixel for sticking with the most underrated weapon in the game for the whole playthrough. HH are the giga chad.

And yes, indeed, the monsters scale based on how many people are in the quest. You guys are playing on what we called the ""hard mode"" with 3 hunters.

Needs to be watched on the big screen. I just adore KC what a character.|, Even if this movie is atrociously bad it gives off edge of tomorrow vibes and just early 2010's sci-fi. I absolutely love it tbh.|, This movie was a real roller coaster to me. I didn't expect much, and it was indeed slow and shaky at the start. But the movie just kept getting better as the apocalypse started, the camera work was incredible! The several plot twists near the end were beautifully done, and that ending was truly amazing. Very enjoyable movie! ❤|, Wish this got a better writing team during production. Just finished watching it. Not good and not bad, but definitely iconic. This is the greatest original sci-fi concept I've seen for a movie in a long while and the visuals are absolutely stunning. If the story's writing had been better I believe this movie would have been a huge success like Sci-fi standouts such as Elysium or Passengers.|, Saw this in theaters the other day I enjoyed it some genuinely awesome scenes and the plot twist is unique for a disaster film unfortunately I was the only one in the theater so I guess it’s not doing too well|, Es magnífica acabo de verla.. me dejó con muchas ganas de una segunda parte ver cómo nuestra civilización obtiene un avance tecnológico gigantescamente sorprendente.... 100/10 es estupenda para quienes aman y tienen un atractivo a cerca del espacio y sus secretos y mucho mas|, This is going to make 2012 and Armageddon look like the most realistic documentaries of all time, lol.|, I'll be honest, when I first watch the trailer, I thought it was rubbish.

It's certainly a movie that exists. I'll rate it a  /10.|, Near the end when he said “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a morb”, my heart truly felt. On a scale from 1-10, I would definitely give this movie one of those numbers.|, I loved when Morbius said, ""When life gives you morbs, make morbinade."" It was honestly inspiring and eye-opening. It is truly one of the lines of all time.|, Whenever he says “it’s morbin time” before morbing all the enemies… it just brings a tear to my eye.

Hands down a movie that was made and people watched|, ""Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf""

""What about side by side with a Morb?""

Never have I cried so hard. Truly one of the cinematic moments.|, The scene where Dumbledore says to Harry Potter ""there's morb from where that's came from"" is one of the lines to be ever written, truly one of the movies ever made.

Although it was rushed because they fit all the books into one movie and so you could sort of tell when a book started and finished because it had different feels throughout the whole thing.

And I absolutely love how J. K. Simmons voices him like in the show!

Honestly a perfect addition to Mortal Kombat|, Out of ALL the DLC characters from all MK games, I feel like this is probably one of the best. This trailer gave Omni-Man justice and frankly, he just fits the roster perfectly in my honest opinion. I very much look forward to this!|, I love how he shows less struggle in the clashes, and how he's able to travel at those speeds, then come to a stop instantly, He really lives up to his FTL speed feats, and His Planet busting strength.|, Kinda mind-blowing that the game looks so good that the trailers don’t need any fancy pre-rendered cutscenes and can just be pure gameplay|, Never thought we would see the man himself in an MK game but it's like he was made for Mortal Kombat he fits so perfectly...|, The way he dodged Scorpion's ""Get over here"" is just insane|, Every animated character is gonna look weird in 3D but man did they nail Omni man|, 0:42 seeing this put into the game is really cool. Out of all the moves translated into the game from the show this one is my favorite, so simple yet so impactful to those who watched the show and know that this is how he kill’s Donald.

He's taken seriously, his tics are realistic, it's paired with OCD symptoms. I mean, I'm amazed. I was bullied so much for my Tourette's, but some of the most hurtful comments were from people telling me that I was lying because my Tourette's wasn't what they had seen in the media, or telling me that I can't hang out with their kid because I'm going to curse. So, having an accurate portrayal means a lot. I can't wait to see it, but am not looking forward to ticcing the entire time|, A trailer that intrigues but doesnt give away the critical plot points or ending. Refreshing. Cant wait.|, This is the most authentic, well researched portrayal of Tourette’s I’ve ever seen in a movie. I’m so happy that we’ve finally got some good representation that isn’t just jokes about yelling fuck! I’m absolutely going to be in the theater opening night, ticcing loud and proud|, I was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome when I was 14. I very much approve of this, it is about time we got a movie like this. For more people to understand it, to not judge it, to not make constand jokes about it. I was bullied and ridiculed in highschool and even after I graduated. People didn't understand me and my tics and still don't.  The struggles that we face are much greater then people know, it's an everyday struggle. I can't wait to see this movie, and the change it will hopefully bring about how people view this disorder.|, this is a cult classic for me.  I don't know why more people don't rave about this film, it's artistically outstanding in a number of ways.  Cast, soundtrack, Ed Norton's funny asf little tourette scats, the beautiful jazz scenes, the troubled characters, amazing acting.  Love this film|, Edward Norton is back, hell yeah|, May not seem like much, but having Tourette’s  myself, Its good to see a movie being released about someone battling with Tourette’s. Tells a story how he copes and adapts to his life no matter the struggles he goes through.|, For those who don't know, the main power guy is based on Robert Moses of NY.  He basically controlled all of NY from 1930 to almost 1970 I believe.  And he was kinda like a mob boss, where people just assumed he was the park commissioner, but in reality he had more power than the mayor.|, Dude, I have literally never seen anyone try to portray this on-screen at all.
As someone who has dealt with it my entire life, it's refreshing. 
They even got the whole thought based aspect of it, with reoccurring thoughts and ideas. That's like how 90% of it works for most of us."

These actors loved to do this movie because it's just really funny and well written, these are actors that had a thousand of scripts in their hands. If they didn't think it would be good, they would never have done it. It's creative and a very sharp parody on actual things, every sketch has another parody on a certain subject. It's parody humor, you like it, don't. And I loved this one. :)|, A large cast of accomplished actors, plus 12 directors, 20 writers, 13 editors, and 9 cinematographers are credited as the geniuses in front and behind the cameras of ""Movie 43"", and yet the whole thing feels as if it was shot and slapped together by a threadbare crew of bored hacks. Richard Gere’s performance is so guarded he’s like a crustacean hiding under a rock.|, I just watched it and it's so funny, I laughed the entire time🤣"

Mr. Holmes,Mr. Holmes Official US Release Trailer #1 (2015) - Ian McKellen Mystery Drama HD,0G1lIBgk4PA,1576995,5475,335,"This is one of the nicest movies I have watched in a long time.  Anyone who likes the fictional character Sherlock Holmes can discover him in a different light.  For all his intelligence, he is after all a human being.  This film touches on the subject of human fragility, loneliness, and how we all need each other.|, Jeremy Brett has always been my favorite Sherlock Holmes because of the humanity brought to the character. But Ian McKellen is a gem, and this is now my second favorite rendition of the character. It's heartfelt, and compassionate.|, Masterfully acted, beautifully photographed and directed this is one of the best movies of 2015. Ian McKellen should get oscar nomination for his performance and so should the script. It is a very smart, deep profound film directed in very realistic, unique way , production values are top notch, it perfectly mixed drama with humour and character build so you care in the end. It has subtle messages about the world and kinda little bitdifferent people that live among us. Good job 4.5/5|, Beautiful film of life,  love lost and redemption. The lesson it took a lifetime to learn that sometime people do not need a brilliant mind but rather a special heart that listens. A gem.|, This is one of my favorite movies. The acting is rock solid. The plot is tightly written and perfectly intertwining. The story is indescribably beautiful take on a classic character learning to come to terms with his life and mistakes he has made.|, ian mckellen is a legend, first he was gandalf, magneto and now he is sherlock holmes, is there something this guy cant do?!|, Espero no ser la única que se emociono un poco mucho al ver esto. La mejor noticia (vídeo en este caso) del mundo , Gracias me hicieron el año.|, Just saw the movie and the trailer makes it seem so whimsical. It really made my heart ache the whole way. It's pretty emotional.|, I admire that they took a more 'traditional' style to the lore of Sherlock Holmes.|, This is a beautiful film. I think one of Sir Ian's best. I could listen to that voice all day, soft and caring. Thank you for showing a different side to this character we thought we knew."

Adorable sideways performances prove there’s a special someone for anyone no matter how nutty. Happy ever after stalls trying to answer the old Hollywood question “can romance flourish in tandem with violent mayhem?” Surely the romance isn't over after just a few murders? Should I feel guilty because I cheer for them? Questions bigger than me. I loved this perfect scramble.|, 37:45 as someone who loves knife throwing, this is a freaking beautiful scene.|, I am not normally a fan of Anna Kendrick. But this movie was so different! And funny! Loved it! 😍|, This was awesome! Funny, quirky...loved it!|, Such a cool movie with Sam Rockwell, Anna Kendrick and Tim Roth 👏👏👏👏👏👏Anna and Sam has a very strong chemistry.   Thank you for sharing.|, That was an awesome movie I love Anna Kendrick 😍 the quality is great too!|, I can see why she fell for him. The chemistry between those two is magic. 
I like the fact he didn’t have to teach her the art of self defence, her body was naturally in-tune with the energy of an opponents. 
Sam Rockwell is some kind of sexy and damn if he doesn’t have some fine dance moves. And the best part, he’s not a Hollywood pretty boy. Rather, he has an every man look that’s simple yet exudes an all powerful, sex appeal without it being over bearing. He, quite simply put, is the perfect ideal of a husband with whom I’d be comfortable growing old with.|, Very fun film to watch! I hope there's a sequel!|, Anna Kendrick has a lot of talent, and karate is one of them!!!🦶👊💖"

It took a lot of guts back then to say that Congress was playing a crooked game, but this movie said it with gusto!|, Yeeesssss YEEESSS. What a trailer!! 
This is what you suppose to do with a classic. Relaunch it with an awesome trailer. 

I have to confess I’m surprise that Sony made a good, not 2 -and-a -half -minute-spoily -trailer. You made my day.|, James Stewart had so much integrity and true passion to each and every role he took on|, I didn't think you could spin this classic to make it feel like a Harrison Ford/Jack Ryan movie but I've been proven wrong.|, Jimmy Stuart was so beautiful!!!

Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris,MRS. HARRIS GOES TO PARIS - Official Trailer [HD] - Only In Theaters July 15,iO9JcPbbmAA,3979179,7069,344,"This movie was darling. So charming and wholesome. Simple yet exquisite. There were no explosions, no unnecessary drama or angst; just a wonderful film about a woman following her hopes and dreams with a happy ending. I want more films like this. And of course, top-notch acting from the brilliant Lesley Manville.|, Just finished the movie! How enchanting. It totally lifted my spirits…I think I smiled through the whole movie! We all need a Mrs. Harris in our life, we all need kindness, and to spread kindness. 
If this was made years ago… I could see Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant as the characters.|, I teared up watching this.  We all need a movie about dreams and hope.  Perfect time for it.|, This movie is absolutely enchanting! Lesley Manville is an exceptional actress!! Her ability to completely transform herself in every role blows my mind. This movie took my breath away and in the end I shed a few tears because it was so magical!!! Exceptional.|, My husband and I went to go see this the other day on a wasted rainy afternoon we loved it it was just such a happy movie about people no CGI no major drama just a beautiful story about regular people in such a gorgeous setting that is how I always imagine Paris would be I highly recommend this movie|, Saw this movie yesterday.  Such a feel good movie that favors the underdog surrounded by genuinely good people who we would all be fortunate enough to have more of in our lives. For Mrs. Harris I cried happy tears for her.  This movie is now in my top ten favorites.  Love the cast and the stunning dresses!|, How many “Invisible women” have dreamed like this? How can this film only be in theatres for a day?! Maybe they’re going to shift to Amazon Prime after. It will do well I’m sure! Smartly written & acted. I teared up on the preview alone & never knew about the book or previous film(s). 
Just this. Some time with some beauty. Sounds lovely. I’ll be in the lookout. Well done everyone.|, this movie shows the importance of a good person how selfish people need them and how the whole world can't live without them. the eternal optimist energies everyone and when she loses hope the universe comes to the aid to make right and to bring her back to life. She is the motivation of so much she is the driving force of all things she is hope|, Man I wish I saw this on the big screen! Finally watched it on Netflix, and just wow. Beautiful movie, beautifully filmed, beautiful message! I cried so much throughout, maybe because I’ve also been a cleaner I felt her struggles, or it could be the pregnancy hormones 😅 it was a wonderful movie and I highly recommend.|, I just saw the film this evening and watched a Q&A with the director after. They originally thought the demo was going to be older women. But the more it has been seen the wider and wider the demo has grown. It has appealed to women, men, fashionistas, people who love historical films, girls, the LGBTQ+ community (aka, the gays, we love it!). It will really be a word of mouth film. It opens on Friday in 1,000 theaters around the US. It is EXCELLENT and one of the better films I've seen in a LONG time."

Don’t need the performance pack.|, The '24 Mustang GT continues to be an awesome muscle car value and in no way fake - so SWEET! That new twin throttle body 5L Coyote looks and sounds great. I'd only get the 6 speed but I'd luv to try out that retuned 10 speed auto. Having a hard time looking at the instrument panel (not really integrated with the passenger side). That rear spoiler is puny. What's also cool JR is that the glossy black trim fades to flat black in very little time:)|, Hey Joe, your reviews are always awesome and thorough but you and I know this isn’t the one. Keep doing it as you do.|, I just want to see the screens integrated into the shape of the dash in the revised S650 in a few years time.|, Great review, Amazing car , glad they are continuing with the V8s and the efficiency of power with the dual throttle body . The new tech on the dual screens inside is over the top.  Thanks again for all your great content.|, Cool Mustang GT I truly think this is the Ultra  Apostle to the Muscle Cars. I do love the fake vents I feel like without them the front would look bland.|, The specs 0 to 60 an quarter mile are roughly the same as my old 2011 CTS-V and it was rated at 556 HP with a supercharger.  That's impressive.  Thanks for the video Joe!|, Really like the all one rear end. Looks great|, I wish mustangs had a better reputation because they’re honestly great cars. On the used market I say they’re an amazing deal as well.|, Nice video, speaking of the dash screens needing a housing have you saw the saleen dash? pics i saw they include a nice looking housing that goes around the screens. Curious why they dont use those in all the s650 and im sure they will be available for aftermarket soon"

Then go shooting in your backyard country home shooting range with. Just a few beers so it’s still safe to shoot.|, It looks low budget, but also looks pretty cool. Reminds me of a lot of classic action films from the 90s, but with a modern day grit to it.|, Eckhart is a great actor, and I've been a fan of Nick Searcy since he played Art Mullen on Justified. It'll be great to see him play a similar character.|, Eckhart gotta be one of the most underrated actors ever.|, I liked this movie a lot. It seems like a based on actual events, type of story.|, I am definitely going to watch this movie. I just know it ain't gonna disappoint me, i am 100 percent sure i will love it.🎉|, This movie is great. Most Dog  movies trail off in the end. To the happy making it home ending.

I’m a proud dog owner of 5 and if my dog or dogs was killed, I would hunt down whoever hurt or killed my dog or dogs. My dogs help to keep me sane half if not most of the time.

I love them!|, I'm glad all the original cast are back!|, I watched it at a pre-release screening in London and it is freaking hilarious.

The sets, costumes and cinematography were all first-rate and the acting was excellent especially  by Oscar winner Rachel Weisz and Sam Claflin who was in last year's unforgettable Me Before You. Mr Claflin is a good-looking new actor with a charismatic accent and lots of possibilities. He played the role that Richard Burton played in the original and I hope to hear about him in more movies soon.|, I love the idea of updating some of the older films.  As long as it was not an epic like Ben-Hur..or some that can never be duplicated because of the actors or time line they filmed in.   But taking some of these older movies based on written classics is a sure win!|, I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I think there is something wrong with the tea."

It showed what his early life was like and when something is what happened that's just it- it happened. NOTHING that happens to Dahmer excuses ANYTHING he did, but I think that's why people find these movies so interesting. The thing I think people get confused is excuses versus explanations. I thought that this movie was an attempt to explain, at least partly, why Jeffrey Dahmer turned out the way he did, without excusing his behavior.|, My heart breaks for the families of these innocent victims. Completed the Netflix series. Evan Peters deserves an award. He's such a great actor. But I do hope he recovers mentally from playing such monster. Everyone did such an amazing job. My heart goes out to the families.|, The scariest part of the film is that no one really recognized or cared that there was something really wrong with him|, Nothing... NOTHING can ever justify his crimes or anybody's crimes. Many people are abused and bullied but they never turn into monsters|, I hate when people blame it on bad parenting. A lot of persons grew up in dysfunctional homes or without parents and they didn’t murder.|, This movie was amazing! Absolutely brilliant in portraying his early years and all that helped influence him to who he eventually became. I have to give a MASSIVE round of applause to Ross Lynch! Such great acting. Awesome, should have won so many awards!|, In his will, the real Jeffery Dahmer wrote that he didn't want a funeral, a headstone, or anything of the sort. He wanted to be cremated and spread out. He wanted to be *forgotten* by society completely. I'm gonna watch this movie though.|, Wow he has grown so much from Austin and ally to a big film like this. I'm so proud of him.|, Evan Peters along with Ross Lynch were the best portrayals of Dahmer like they physically resemble him and played him super well."

Three of my favorite people, a beautiful story and filmed in Paris, what more could you want|, Finally! A film I want to watch that my parents can get into!|, The character of Jim resonated so much with me. The pain, lack of esteem, from a dad that leaves you for another family feels like a curse indeed. And you feel like you in turn cause suffering to everyone who comes into your life.  In turn you try finding things to escape the pain. It's like he was conveying my exact words in some scenes. But I don't blame him anymore. C'est la vie.|, Black humour ..brilliant performances ..wonderful music .. A gut tearing reminder of the heavy ‘painbody ‘ passed down to children when parents are ‘playing’ away   wreaking emotional havoc at home with their spouse /partner and children... how heavy the emotional burden of the sins of the Father or Mother can be .. 
   A gem of a cautionary tale .. all three Kevin , Kirsten , Maggie ..so watchable and the French café music .. delightful!   .|, Just watched this amazing film.

Everyone has a story that becomes their decision to stay in their birthplace or to move to another country. I am proud of my citizenship that is not my birthplace and a culture that I don't necessary agree with totally.|, I'm definitely going to watch this! Love my motherland and proud to be a Chinese...|, I don't think there's any problem with being patriotic. Of course, China has a long way to go and a lot of issues to deal with. But it's this steadfast spirit that makes them thrive. US is also so into patriotic education. It's important to unify, to work together and even keep an eye on each other to avoid going astray. Most western countries don't know this feeling either because they have little history and immigrants are hard to unify or because it's already dismantled for a long time, like Europe. It's just different. For sure China has some memorable events they'd like to reminisce and this is just a movie. It's up to you to watch it or no. Just cut them some slack...|, I haven’t been to China in years and only lived there for lik 3 years when I was born yet this movie made me feel patriotic for some reason.  Damn.  These are confusing times|, I am proud to be an American and am proud of my country. You all go ahead and be proud of your nationality and country.|, AMC场场爆满已经说明了问题，我们生活很好，不需要带着口罩上街。中国有各种各种各样的问题，大家都看得见，但是我兔真的是在前进，而且前进的比谁都快，比谁都努力。不要选择性的看不见！
引用一位网友的话：十几年前我还很小的时候，我们还很穷，干什么都不成。 报纸上天天在讨论温饱问题，说贫困村一家人只有一条裤子，港澳台同胞就像是天外来客，吃穿用度都让人嫉妒成恨。 那时候，美国有个总统叫克林顿，他英俊潇洒风流倜傥指哪打哪。 海湾战争让所有的中国军人崩溃，泪流满面的说，原来打仗已经变成了这样。 在电视里看到台海危机，大人们都紧张兮兮。 后来才知道，那时候是真的担心会输。 再后来，南斯拉夫大使馆被炸了，我们很愤怒，却也只能愤怒。 全中国都在关心克林顿的下半身，因为除了这个，美国再没有什么可以嘲笑的了。 我们努力开工厂，卖玩具，卖衣服，上亿劳工从内地来到沿海。 他们说，8亿件衬衫能换一架飞机。 那时候，海里没有大船，主力还是炮艇。 歼十是了不起的最高机密，一般人我们都不告诉他。 世界在不断改变，改变…… 我们还是很穷，好像干什么都不成。 报纸上不在出现温饱二字，而是在讨论民生问题。 贫困村不再只有一条裤子，留守儿童成了新的难题。台湾开通了自由行，去过的朋友都说也不过如此。 GDP超越了德意志，干掉了小日本，发电量超越了美利坚。这是人类历史上的第一次。 世界上最大的钢铁生产国是中国，第二是河北，第三是唐山，我们不再捉襟见肘，开始担心产能过剩环境污染。美国换了总统，又换了总统，他们打了伊拉克，又打了阿富汗，再打了利比亚，最后没钱打叙利亚。 那个愁眉苦脸的小黑干的很苦逼，国会忙着吵架，政府等待关门，我们不再对波士顿惨案幸灾乐祸。 台独还在折腾，大人们却不再紧张。 反而说，嗨，小马哥长的不错。 吉利买了沃尔沃，联想成了PC全球第一。 我们造了全球一半的高铁，日法德加在忙着争论，是谁让中国偷走了核心技术。 我们把机床卖给了德国，把导弹卖进了北约。 美国人宣布判决，说中兴和华为是邪恶企业。哦当然，这份名单上还有北方工业和中国精密机械。 航母已经成军，舰载机挂弹起飞。 歼十不再是稀罕，我们告诉一般人，歼二十已经试飞。 卫星忙着编队，导弹打进了太空。 我们说，那就自己建一个太空站吧。 时间在不停的走远，走远…… 有一半的欧美人说，中国才是最强经济体。 生活越来越好，问题越来越多，视野越来越广，想要的也越来越复杂。 但回想过去，我们已经站在近百年来最好的时候。 本朝已承平60年有余，按我中华之惯例，应该准备迎接盛世了。 我们又成了世界上最牛逼的那几个国家，但那也没什么可以骄傲的，在过去的几千年里，我们常常如此。 就像我爱你，不仅仅是今天。 今天是你的生日，我的中国。 愿你永远没有战乱，永远宁静。 今天是你的生日，我的中国。 愿你逆风起飞，在雨中获得收获。我们的信仰是那飘扬着五星红旗的中国！！！|, Bạn Đồng Lệ Á = Tong Liya đóng phim nào cũng hay thích xem toàn siêu phẩm phim hay 😘😘😘👍👍👍diễn đạt đúng chất khí, yêu cái răng khểnh quá đi thôi Á Tỷ ơi|, 我係個三十多年的中國香港老華橋在加拿大。細細個在外國長大。都大半的竹星仔。面對過好多種族歧視。我非常驕傲自豪自己係中國龍的傳人。

Napoleon,NAPOLEON - Official Trailer #2 (HD),LIsfMO5Jd_w,20494693,133628,9591,"Can we all agree that we've had enough super hero movies over the last 15 years and we want more historical epics|, People followed him because he had something mystical about him. Anyone who met him immediately noted down on returning home what he had done or what he had said, such was the feeling of meeting an extraordinary man.|, I adore how many of the major fight scenes have the appearance of paintings. The coronation was flawless as well.|, The diverse amount of shots, costumes, and production design make this movie look very original and interesting.|, Whoever made the choice to use War Pigs by Black Sabbath in a trailer for a movie about Napoleon....that guy deserves a raise|, As a kid, I saw 'Waterloo' (1970) with Rod Stieger and Christopher Plummer when it first came out. These two great actors went head to head and were magnificent. It was the greatest game of chess I'd ever seen. In that panoramic extravaganza of a film, the overly vibrant colour palette of red white and blue was that of an old painting brought to life. In this film 'Napoleon' a patient audience were sent into the old 1790 painting and other original paintings along that time line. The experience remained dull, sad and cold. Consequently, the horrors of the revolution and subsequent battles and life of Napoleon were more easily absorbed. Despite snippets of genius from Joaquin, I began to see references to 'Joker' coming out in his performance. I personally would have cast Christoph Waltz as Napoleon who was born for this role. He can speak French. I think Joaquin was brilliant as Commodus in Gladiator. In conclusion this film was like a long depressing emotional yet strangely alluring song with no significant intro, chorus, guitar break or outro, so-to-speak, that we didn't already know about. Even though it was 30% historically correct the incorporated new invented stuff was not doing it for me. It just extended the story. The many tough hard faced characters generally cast were gritty enchanting and captivating. Josephine was perfectly cast. I think the film should have been centred more around her not Naploeon. Vanessa Kirby was brilliant. A new star is born. I judge a film on how many times I wanna watch it again. I'd like to watch this film from home. Maybe I'll see it in a different light. How many times would I want to watch it again? For now, one more time at least.|, this looks insanely good!|, Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon bringing back the period drama epic is such a nice change of pace.|, ""I found the crown of France laying in the gutter.... And I put it on my own head""
That line had me.  The delivery was epic.  It had me wondering if that was a direct historical quote or not.  Just fantastic.|, For those who don't know the history of Napoleon.

Dude grew up, power fed, always wants to rise up in the ranks, and then become the emperor of France. He won 5 wars against every country near him and then he  loss. They threw him on a isolated island where he can't do shit. This movie is going to be really fucking good"

That opening always send chills down my spine...|, This is my favourite of Miyazaki's films and I feel that the trailer does not do justice to this masterpiece. Who agrees with me?|, This movie is incredible but I recommend you all read the Nausicaa manga. The art is amazing and it's Miyazaki's life's work!|, Love miyazaki's ""nature and spirit"" main subject, never gets boring and he explore it through so much interesting ideas|, Even if it's not their highest rated one, to me Studio Ghibli struck gold on their first film. Nausicca and thr Valley of the Wind is a beauitful story about cooperating with nature and I will love it to the end of time.|, This movie is fucking beautiful to the point of perfection.  I've always been the guy to be mad if the MC didn't get some kind of retribution or revenge on the people who wronged them and this movie just didn't give me that feeling. I'm fine with the peace they had and that's amazing for me.|, I don't care how outdated this movie is... everyone who loves anime should see it. Great message and music!|, Me gustan todas las películas de Ghibli, pero está en especial me hizo reflexionar tanto del mundo, la vida y los humanos.
Es mi película favorita 💕.|, ugh, i'm so happy when people watch nausicaa. whenever people mention their favorite hayao miyazaki films, almost nobody's ever heard of nausicaa.... :( it's my most favorite film that shaped my childhood and i live by it!|, I absolutely love this movie.  It's my favorite.  Highly underrated Ghibli film."
Ne Zha,NE ZHA Official Trailer (2019) Animation Manga,xdOgym7MLAU,4351588,71473,3184,"""May those who accept their fate be granted happiness.""
*""May those who defy their fate be granted glory.""*|, I remember watching the 1979 animated version of Nezha as a kid and loving the hell out of it. Traditionally animated, with beautiful soundtrack and storyline closer to the original legend. It'll be interesting to see how this (very different) adaptation goes.|, I just went to watch this movie in Australian cinema and it was GREAT!!! ^_^ Absolutely breath-taking and emotional with a lot of funny moments!!! Highly recommended for anyone interested in watching it :) You won't regret it~!|, I just watched this movie. Cried a lot. Moved by the emotions of Ne Zha and his parents. A bit background for non Chinese audience: this story is based on toaism stories from ancient China. The two masters are all toaist immortals from the heaven. This movie tells us two things: 1. A lot of tragedy is rooted from biased opinion (or public feeling). The master of AO BING, e.g., betrayed his master because he thought his master did not value him due to his leopard identity, which is not true. He then made huge mistake to let Ne Zha become the deamon pill. There are bias everywhere and if accumulated at large, it can be devastating. 2. Your fate is determined by urself. In china a lot of ppl believe their destiny is determined when they were born, which is not totally untrue （if you do some research on horoscope fortune telling.) But most important is how you face it even though you know ur fate. The key is in ur heart, what u believe. There were a lot of examples in history that ppl altered their fates by doing good deeds to the society. This is my 2 cents of view from a Chinese perspective.|, It has just hit North America and I have already watched it twice...love it so much! For people know the Chinese language well there're a lot of nice lines and memes to pick up, for people not familiar with the Chinese language well, the spirit, character, action and animation also make this movie worth watching! This movie deserves more global attention❤️|, I sincerely hope more amazing movies like this will come out from China. We have so much interesting stories within the Chinese historical/sci-fi/fantasy universe that will provide endless storylines for good animation movies/games.|, I just saw the movie.
I am mind-blown with the animation as well as story. 9/10
This anime is way better than Frozen 2 crap.|, As a Chinese audience, I feel it is necessary to explain something about the movie 

1:although Nezha is a three year old kid，but he born with Divine power，he is a god（from Legend of China）。so you don't have to compare him with the child who really three year old。

2.director want to show that:only yourself can decide who you are but not  fate to control you。(this is the only and main meaning of the movie

3The background of the movie is ：the world have people and monster and gods 。but not in harmony, they are biased about each other。

hope it can help you to understand this movie better and thank you for like this movie|, I heard all the good things about it and dragged my best friend to see it. Still blown away even after having seen multiple trailers! Some things surprised me and I genuinely like the characters so much. Glad to see China’s animation industry growing so much; I hope _The Legend of Hei_ gets a similar international release. ^^|, I have watched this yesterday
this trailer didn't reveal too much, watch the movie then u will know what's actually happened
I love it! One of the best animated movie so far for me"

Just in case you all forgot, the critics said Cuties was amazing while everyone else called it child grooming.|, I haven't seen it yet, but what I'm hearing a lot so-called critics from Hollywood hate it. So, it's probably a good movie.|, I just watched this movie, I’m blown away. I had gotten chills throughout this movie as it really goes in depth with this spiritual battle we’re going through today. It really is right in front of people face.. it’s almost as if everyone is content with what goes on. Sean Patrick Flannery, Bravo! Phenomenal performance.|, Just finished watching this movie. Forget what critics are saying. EVERYONE needs to see this movie! I'm glad the word is definitely getting out about how great it is. Our theater was SOLD OUT. 🙌 Amazing all around. Excellent message, very impressive writing, truly outstanding performances! Gonna come back with the entire family!|, EXCELLENT and it's by no means an ""Exorcism"" movie.   The feeling that you are in the presence of pure evil is done so well and the shifting back and forth between the demon and the actual person keeps you wondering each moment who is speaking.   
For non-believers - you are certainly free to express your opinion, in fact that's a huge part of what this movie is all about.
For believers - Yeah,  helps you see why this world is literally being shredded before our very eyes.  Evil is real, as are demons, the devil and Hell and there are only two choices we have and we DO have a choice.|, I saw it last night. Amazingly written. Not exactly horror - but the tension and suspense was definitely there.  Sean Flannery did an amazing job as Nefarious.|, Best movie I've seen in years. It puts you so deep in thought. I got home from the theater and this whole movie kept playing back in my mind. Makes you look at life, heaven, and hell alot different wether you believe or not.|, Couple takeaways (NO SPOILERS)

(1) Writing was very very good and creative (and direct when it needed to be but very seldomly)
(2) Acting was very very convincing. The whole
""suspension of disbelief"" ie it held my attention and was very immersive.
(3) Timing and cinematography were smooth and moved along well.
(4) and the message was very mature and relevant.

Honestly, way way way better than I expected and I definitely recommend seeing it.|, This is one of those rare movies that even as you are in the process of watching it, you already don't want it to end. 10/10 For me.|, My goodness....this movie is absolutely AMAZING.  The demons personality is portrayed EXACTLY like we see in the Bible.  This movie is getting ALOT of hate from Hollywood types etc. because it portrays the REAL evil in this current world. Those people don't think that stuff is evil!  So they HATR the movie or say "" Its not that good""   No......This is a masterpiece.  The guy in the movie even tells Nefarious that society has made so much progress! tolerance is at an all time high, acceptance of each other religions etc woke garbage and the demon LAUGHS.  He says "" I coulden't have said it better myself, sometime you humans even surprise us with the evil you come up with""     and the laugh.......so evil and creepy."

Never Rarely Sometimes Always,NEVER RARELY SOMETIMES ALWAYS - Official Trailer [HD] - At Home On Demand April 3,hjw_QTKr2rc,3323143,6698,1385,"As someone still reeling in the emotional aftermath of an abortion, this trailer brought tears. It is so heartening to see that women are not isolated or alone in these experiences, and I hope that we are soon in a space where we can talk about these things more openly. Without judgement but with access to care. Watching this weekend.|, Just watched this and it really sneaks up on you- if you’re a fan of raw, naturalistic indie filmmaking (you know, the kind that gets labeled boring a lot) this is an absolute must see. Can’t get it out of my head|, Just watched the film and its heartbreakingly real happenings for teenage pregnancy. I would have to commend the cousin for never leaving her side even how grumpy she is. Their performance is spectacular!|, The fact that a teenage girl can be seen as old enough to have a child but not old enough to decide for herself she isn’t fit to have one is so fucked up. It makes me so deeply, indescribably angry|, I thought this kind of filmmaking doesn’t exist anymore. Intimate, raw, powerful. Thank you, Eliza Hittman.|, This trailer seems to bring out the problems and situations that some girls face and I feel it will be a real eye opening movie.|, One of the best movies I’ve seen in years. The realism is flat-out jarring, and the two main, young actresses both turn in extraordinary performances.|, I've never been in a situation that the main character. Something about this trailer just hit me hard. And I have no idea why. I never cry when watching trailers.|, The most underrated film of the last few years. Definitely a masterpiece.|, Amazing film. The relationship between her and her cousin was beautiful and it's such a sad and frustrating the journey protagonist had to go through. Ideally, this should at the very least receive an Oscar nod but we'll see..."

I don’t want him to die.|, The one thing about this documentary that I always remembered is the scene where Hayao witnesses Ai artwork being done and he's disgusted by it. Just the thought of Ai being done to create what humans had to strive for in years and years of learning and teaching is really unpleasant to think about. Felt like a slap to Hayao and all the work he's spent his life, as well as his colleagues, doing day by day.|, His reaction towards the guy saying ""we want to make a machine that can perfectly draw what humans can"" was priceless. And very relatable.|, Well, we know by now that ""The boy and the Heron"" won't be his last film. What an insane, yet inspiring man hahahaha. I ADORE the creations of him and his team. These movies are more than just a story. They seem almost alive. They are a feeling we all have felt. They aren't one-sided nor clishee|, Watching this after he said the boy and the heron would be is last film and now he's saying that he has more ideas, it is quite funny, this man is a fantastic definition of workaholic. Even now, after everything, he just cant stop|, It's fun to think that as he retired here once more, he came back again and finished a massive project The Boy And The Heron, which I will see next week. The reviews have been great and even now at 82 he's starting another project!|, So cool to see the genius at work. Long live Maestro!|, Thank you for this incredibly valuable documentary on the transparent, energetic and insightful, wind-like soul of a man, Hayao Miyazaki🙏💙|, Excelente trabajo SpidiBoy.

The time setting , and the vibe that this movie gives out is just incredible!|, In Nightmare Alley, Cate Blanchett is mesmerizing. Her voice, her look, her presence totally commands your attention. An actress at the peak of her skills in an incredible movie.|, Guillermo del Toro’s ability to world-build is incredible. The cinematography, production design, costumes look to be on the level The Shape of Water and Pan’s Labyrinth. Put that together with this cast, and I cannot wait to see this in the theater.|, This is the best film of the year. Everything about it is incredible and I love how Guillermo made Cate Blanchett's character even eviler than in the original. Not motivated by money or love, just a pure psycho. She is the vilest femme fatale to ever hit the silver screen.|, The cast is phenomenal and the aesthetic of this movie is so gorgeous!|, I just watched this movie and if there's an embodiment that can describe ""you become what you hate"", this movie shows it perfectly.|, Can't imagine the magical feeling of being surrounded by greats like Bradley Cooper, Toni Collett, Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Willem Dafoe...they all deserve the Oscar. Still, I'm also hoping Peter Dinklage grabs one this year.|, “If you displease the right people, the world closes in on you very very fast”- Cate Blanchett’s line perfectly captures the power plays of academic science.|, The cinematography is phenomenal, I'm just blown away,  but those period artistic shots I can't wait to see.  I can tell the development of those characters were given a lot of thought.  Just seeing them translates an idea or story before the first word.  Entertaining in itself. And Cate Boanchett?  Oh my,  Yeah I think I need to see this movie.|, Watched this movie yesterday and wow , I’m speechless, what a masterpiece… it keeps you thinking about it for hours after watching it, the visuals, you feel like you are in the movie.. and the ending is incredible… wow.."

Hope to see more Edson Oda films soon 👏|, I just saw this today. I was crying almost constantly through the movie, a powerful and sensitive film that captures so much about human nature, and how we choose to live our lives and shape the people in our care.|, To the creators of this move: thank you. Thank you for helping me to feel alive after years of trying to make myself numb.|, Life changing movie with incredibly deep meaning. Diabolically underrated, no idea how anyone can hate on this.|, I saw Nine Days at Sundance last year with three members of my family. This is one of the best movies I have seen in my life.

I have been eagerly waiting for it to be officially released every since to show it to the rest of my family.|, Saw this movie last week and I gotta say that I really needed to see it. Usually a movie like this cant capture my patience but I truly enjoyed every single second of this movie and cried multiple times. It’s a healing film.|, Wow. Watched this last night and can’t stop thinking about it. Captivating, emotional, beautiful and brought tears to my eyes. A wonderful piece. Thank you to all involved in its creation.|, This movie broke me to perfection. An opus about the souls that were too beautiful to live and the ones that lived that suffered for their beauty.....the ANGER that this injustice deserves so well, and the forgiveness we owe ourselves for being sensitive.

'Bout the wait
Bein' in the hood with no escape
Learned from my mistakes
Sentence on cases
Back when I was five years old, I knew that I was gon' be great
I found my gift for music back around the age of eight
I knew I'd be successful, it was more about the wait
So unacceptable as being in the hood with no escape
My mama taught me right but I just learned from my mistakes
Started washing up the day I caught a sentence on the case
Hunger pains shaped me to the way I am today
I gotta live with it, feelings that won't ever go away
Not every day I pray, but that ain't nothing cute to say
The money good, but how I know my boys is finna stay?
Put my all into this music, I ain't make it here to play
Came a long way from booking niggas, me and Trigga Trey
Okay, I'm just tryna shed a little bit of light
And motivate them kids who haven't found they way in life
Remember I ain't have nowhere to lay my head at night
Trappin' on the block, I was sellin' weed and dirty Sprite
Don't wait until you hurtin' 'fore you choose to pray to Christ
Shooter on my package, you ever see me on them bikes
Still be in my hood, I'm comin' up, I'm playin' dice
I earned my stripes so I walk around my city like shit nice
On God, I wish I could make sure everybody eat
Red bottoms drippin' off of everybody feet
Hard feelings, I be thinking everybody keep
And I'm workin' hard, I be up while everybody sleep
Asthma acting up, fuck it, I don't really care
Still spittin' bars while I'm wheezing for some air
Pocket hold a deuce, and yeah, it's small, I'm well aware
When it flare, hit your melon, bet your salsa hit the air
Vvs's diamonds on me, reason why they stare
Youngest out the city, reason I don't really care
An on my body, best believe I'm well aware
Quarter milli' on the 'Gram, lil' boy, you're nowhere near
Flexed up, just was next up, now I'm up now
Down to Earth, true to all my fans, I could touch ground
Run up on me thinkin' I don't got it, you get pumped down
Bustdown, glizzy in my pocket, stupid nigga
No security, 18, I don't think they hearing me
Apparently niggas ain't real, shit be scaring me
I'm glizzied up, got that glizzy tucked, why they fearing me?
Rap nigga try to throw shade, why he daring me?
18, got a clean record thanks to YO
Your bitch, she swallow
You feel a way, then catch a hollow
And hits really nothin', we don't really care for five-o
I been doin' this shit, as a kid I was nine-o
But they don't really know that, somethin' like a throwback
Tryna clean the image up so I don't wanna show that
Headed to the top, I ain't never tryna go back
Signs you see me throwin' up, they nothin' like a zodiac
Fuck the other side, see my nuts, they can hold that
Showin' off them pistols, I ain't never seen you blow that
Smelly hella proud and the opps already know that
If y'all want me gone
Why don't you come and pull up where a show at? No cap
No cap (niggas already know I was gon' make it)
Man, you know I was gon' make it
You know I was gon' make it, yeah
I can talk my, my stuff now
'Cause we out here
No, yeah, you act tough inside the school
And out here, look at you today, yeah, quiet
Remember sellin' white up on the block
Tryna make some knots
D's try to run up in the spot
Me and Smelly sittin' in the trap
Smokin' on the pack
Wrong crib, all you smell is crack
And I done put my trenches onto rap
I wish I could go back
To August 14th to be exact
That's when my nigga Smelly would be here
Trauma so severe
I had to watch him crying out for air
Bet he's in the air, make me cough
Spinnin' through the fourth
Catch an opp, I'm finna take him off
And I call the shots, I'm a boss
Skinny version Ross
Dummy in the air, take a loss
Y'all niggas gon' get me caught up, man
Got me talkin' hot as shit, man
Niggas know my body though
SB the fuck up, gang"

Hollywood could really start bringing back these types of comedy movies...
As for Jennifer, we all know how awesome she is|, Hilarious! Terrific movie. It didn't stop bringing the laughter and was very well done. Well-paced and refreshing character variation using a simple idea. If there is a superior way to reproduce a classic theme, this is how you do it. I'm not even sure how they evoked the comedy all through the movie, it was quite skillful. Every setting took a left turn. The roles were strongly individual and produced unexpected results, but zany-believable. It's as if they took handfuls of normal events, mixed them together in a lottery, and the resulting nontraditional setups drew us in to embrace the unique personalities and their interactions even more. There was plenty of resistance and opposition, but it was anything but cold.|, I hope Jennifer does more comedies. She is naturally hilarious.|, Definitely a breath of fresh air. Rock solid full of fun movie. Jennifer looks great in this act and everything seems to fit real well.|, Finally, Jennifer is going full on with her comedic talents. If you see her interviews, you can easily realise her talents.|, This movie made me laugh and it certainly made me feel, I cried quite a few times but it was nice. It tugs at your heart way more than expected, and that's ok. The scenery shots were super nice to boot!!!"

Nocturnal Animals,Nocturnal Animals Official Trailer 1 (2016) - Jake Gyllenhaal Movie,-H1Ii1LjyFU,8550063,32133,2186,"I can't even begin to explain how much I loved this movie. I spent all night researching trying to find the meaning behind the ending and now its 4 in the morning XD|, I saw this film today and it blew me away. I didn't want it to end. It was completely enthralling and hypnotic. Stunning is the only word I can use to describe it.|, I dont know what it is about Jake Gyllenhaal but he is such a phenomenal actor. Every piece of work he releases is truly incredible. This will surely be nothing short of superb.|, This film is an artistic masterpiece. We have a brilliant cast, a brilliant director and a perfect story line that many people can relate to. It shows the antithesis of creative and neurotic minds through the portrayal of Amy Adams character, Susan. It really makes you think, and what Amy said that the start about it being a cautionary tale is so true. Susan’s character is a strong character with a good mask that she hides behind. The fact that she gave up her true love for someone that doesn’t love her but has a lot of power and money really shows the human condition. Films like this are priceless, after watching this film it made me think of other brilliant films like ‘We Need To Talk About Kevin’ and ‘The Killing of a Sacred Deer’. The moment when Susan at the end of the film realises the extent of her cruel decision was the perfect ending, you can see the emotion in her eyes as she is filled with existential dread. 

Jake’s character, Edward Sheffield was a brilliant. Two of the best actors of our time. Roberto Andes would’ve been so much better if either Rami Melik or Christian Slater had played it. And Ray Marcus would really suit Jared Letto too. 

Toms message of not throwing away people you love is such a strong one that we can all relate to. Truly an admirable director. And the director of photography was perfect for the role. The colour tones in this were perfect, the grain and grit really boosts the overall experience and weight of the film, the colour tones are just as important as the story itself. The way they have used Photography and Cinematography is perfect. 

Truly a flawless film, I can’t think of anything that I didn’t like in this. I would love to read this in a book.|, Everyone's excited over Jake Gyllenhaal and yeah he's an incredible actor but the person who actually really shines in this movie is Aaron Taylor-Johnson. He was so creepy and sinister and did an awesome job.|, Not made for everyone. But in my opinion it's a masterpiece. <3 Especially if you understand the actual meaning of the movie.|, i am never getting overthe chills i get from this trailer. the music and how every piece is perfectly put together with the actors talking. sends chills down my spine. and i keep listening to that music many many times a year.  seriously jake gyllenhaal has made so many great movies it's ridiculous!|, I loved this movie. Love the amazing relevant connections between fiction and real life put together. Great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and score.|, The best film i've seen in the past 5 years. Beautifully made psychological thriller. It's a work of art. Gyllenhal, adams, shannon and taylor-johnson are all excellent. It's a story within a story, the trailer only brushes the surface|, This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. Jake Gyllenhaal is starring again and the story is mesmerizing you in various feelings and concepts you need to think of them; love, anger, devastation, revenge, beliefs... It is highly recommended 👌"
Nomadland,NOMADLAND | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures,6sxCFZ8_d84,8414404,49236,4338,"I'm a full-time nomad. Everyone out here has a story that's driven them to step outside of societies norms. Some of those tales begin with tragedy, but we all find family out here. A person gets the opportunity to recognize themselves in each person they meet. We are one huge, human family. ❤️|, I saw this movie a week after my father passed away. He was fighting cancer for two years when he got Covid in the clinic where he had his chemotherapy.
What I’ve learned from this movie is that you should never give up, always keep the simple moments in your mind, they become the most beautiful memories and go on with your life as the person you lost would like you to do.

-Rest in Peace Dad, I’ll see you down the road.|, 'Nomadland' is a fantastic movie - one of the best movies I've seen in my sixty three years. It hits home on so many levels! God bless the nomads. ✌|, This movie is so authentic.  There are so many people who go through these emotions even if they are not nomads and I think that’s what makes this unique and great. The friendship, the loss, the adventure, the grief and the sorrow. All of it. If you have truly lived your life then this movie will resonate with you. Enjoy the good times because it is true that they are not forever and for the brief moments they are happening they are wonderful. See you down the road.|, So full of consideration and sympathy. I watched this at a time where I was alone and feeling myself deteriorate, when the credits rolled it didn't even felt like the end. It was so soothing and takes you on a calmer place, definitely a masterpiece.|, Just watched this film this evening and found it profoundly moving. Beautiful cinematography and magnificent performances all round.
This film could be seen as a love letter to a way of life that’s free from material wealth, where friendship, love and contentment are what really matter.|, A beautiful film that features many of my friends. Was honored to be an extra on the set for awhile and see the crew work together. The director, producers, actors and actresses were fabulous together and it was a treat to watch them making this masterpiece.|, The grief and pain in her eyes throughout the movie is worth an Oscar💞|, This trailer by itself is a masterpiece. You could feel the awards. You could taste it. It has grace, it is subtle and warm.|, i spent a month by myself on the road out west, and i met many nomads along the way. everywhere i went, i met strangers from all walks of life, each with their own story, wisdom, and unique brand of hospitality. this film beautifully encapsulates the reality of modern American nomads"

Great stuff.|, I like how all of his movies have had an animal motif. Get Out had deer, Us had rabbits, now this one has horses.|, Finally, a trailer that gives you a taste without explaining the entire plot. This is exactly what trailers should be, give a bit of backstory and set the tone.|, If you haven’t watched this movie, at least once, you have to. It’s incredible in every way an epic movie should be. The character’s personalities and backstories are interwoven poetically with the situation they face. I didn’t understand alot of the nuances in the movie so after reading about the symbolism and meaning, I had to watch it again and enjoyed it even more, catching the details that eluded me the first time. 5 stars.|, God after actually seeing the movie I gotta say this was a perfect trailer for it. Gave me just the right things to think about as the movie unfolded|, I finally had the opportunity to watch this (2022) film last night and have to say it’s amazing. I absolutely loved Peele’s “Get Out” film (2017) so my expectations were high. This film positively blew those expectations into a million pieces. I can see myself rewatching this one several times again.|, You know things are weird when this comes out at 2am|, I love the way in some scenes when a character sees some sort of bad sign they just say ""NOPE"". This movie is hilarious with Kiki Palmers acting skills. And also scary thanks to Jordan peele|, I just find it all interesting how the titles for Jordan’s movies are short, yet have so much meaning behind them. I saw nope in IMAX opening night. Very good film. The chimpanzee scene was absolutely crazy.. Peele and Kaluuya are slowly becoming one of Hollywoods greatest duo’s on the big screen. Couldn’t convince me otherwise.|, Ever since Jordan Peele's new horror movie was announced, I imagined something psychedelic and abstract. But the official trailer for Nope (2022) went to another level. The viral marketers are great at making this incredible and amazing official trailer, I congratulate them very much."

Novitiate,Novitiate | Official Trailer HD (2017),8kKexutLfE0,455320,1309,66,"I was so impressed with this movie! Not even that religious myself, it had an interesting enough story to pull me in and told it very honestly, fair and balanced without too much judgment on Catholicism in the 1960s. As I like to say “question everything”...

Margaret Qualley, Julianne Nicholson, Melissa Leo and the rest of the cast of postulants were superb.|, I loved it. If you have a longing for God/love/spiritual community, this movie will touch you.|, I wish that some ex-nuns would respond to this movie, instead of mostly Catholics or ex-Catholics who think they knew what went on behind the closed doors of the convents. This was a cloistered community (they never left the grounds and seldom spoke). I was a nun in an active community during this historical time. Some of what was portrayed in this movie is true and did happen in some convents, other things I can’t even imagining happening like the scenes of the young women dancing around an outdoor fire with the bridal gowns on. But the reluctance of the Mother Superior to react positively to the changes brought forth by the Vatican Council and her reluctance to educate the other nuns about it was true in the community I belonged to, as well. Several nuns left our community because they embraced the changes and the community did not. The discipline or flagellation wasn’t practiced in many communities in this century, but had been practiced in the far past, but more often by brothers. Read books and stories by ex- nuns and you’ll find some similarities to this movie.|, An absolute gem of a movie. Not only the story of a young girl trying to become a nun (which is interesting in itself) but raises the  question to what extent the changes recommended by Vatican II were inadvertently harmful to the very basis of monastic life. The Mother Superior's methods seem harsh, old-fashioned. She's vain, overbearing, not at all ""Christian-like"". Yet the older nuns represent a strong, interconnected, distinct community and this cohesiveness was threatened by the liberalizing attitudes of the 1960's. Cathleen's path was left hanging at the end so there's lots of possible story lines to follow in a sequel.|, Phenomenal movie. Love love love  it.|, Oh my God. I don't think I've ever been so happy to watch a film. I can't wait.|, That mother responded so angrily I was shocked . the acting was wonderful. I enjoyed this movie I found in 2019|, found this movie yesterday and its fantastic. 
The way she beg her to comfort her is 😅🔥|, As a former nun who entered a convent at age 14 in 1963 the trailer looks pretty accurate. The flagellation was not typical. That appears a bit of over dramatic Hollywood add on. People want to think that was common ; it was not.. Just like not all congregations cut off a novices hair. Vatican II was so needed and Pope John XXIII brought about a great deal of consolidation among Christian religions. He pointed us in the direction of unity and understanding. The religions still had their own interpretations. My congregation was very reticent to change the habit or allow people to return to their baptismal names. It wasn't till 1970 that the habit was significantly modified. Yes, there was a mass exodus during the mid to late 1960's. My congregation demonized anyone who left. It was sad. I saw someone commenting sarcastically and calling someone a ""boomer"".  They appear a bit uninformed but want to silence people with whom they disagree. Too bad  they are so intolerant of a difference of ideas.|, Should've been set in Ireland or something but diana is amazing as always"
Now You See Me,"Now You See Me Official Opening Scene (2013) - Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman Movie HD",u_diRgwPCS8,22966878,150377,5266,"For all of you interested: the opening scene trick is called a ""clone"". Uses copies/duplicates of the card they want you to pick. That way the card stays visible for an slightly extended period of time which your brain subconsciously will pickup on. Basically manipulates you into ""selecting"" it because it stood out the most. Called a ""force of card"" concealed as a ""choice of card"".|, I love the actor who did the first trick. He just seems so.... Fitting for his role|, Fun fact: the actress that had to perform the under water trick legitimately couldn't get out of the tank|, I love how we just saw 3 talented magicians and a woman who was mauled to death by piranhas|, Lol this was a fun and entertaining movie to watch in theaters, even my mom (very hard to please) thought so. The tricks were fancy, the characters larger than life and the actors were great to watch! I just loved the glamor and style they showcased. |, Literally one of the best opening scenes especially in cinemas😭💜|, You know the magic trick is good when a movie trailer guesses your card|, For those wondering how the card trick worked, there are actually a few 7 diamond cards next to each other, that way when he's flicking through the deck, you see it for slightly longer than all the other cards. It's the only value that appears clearly while the rest are blurs.|, The fact that he shuffled the cards perfectly and put the slightest bit of extra time on the Seven so that’s the only one she and everyone else could see in time, is genius.|, The ending of this movie was pretty crazy. Well done movie, whole time doesn't only make the ""characters"" fall for tricks but also the audience watching the movie. Good plot twist."

Ocean's Eight,OCEAN&#39;S 8 - Official 1st Trailer,MFWF9dU5Zc0,22226850,155135,32565,"Be honest, you never imagined them in one movie. Right?|, They need to make more movies like this. High quality, great plot, great actors, enjoyable. Streaming services focus on pushing out more low quality content and for what? We need more memorable cinema pieces like this movie.|, Have watched this for few times and still love it! So much fun and the casts are amazing.|, So how many famous people do u want in a movie?
Oceans 8: *yes*|, I was tolly glued to the screen from the start to the end. Brilliant movie!!  When I saw Cate Blanchette, I was like ""Okay, Elizabeth Tudor gave up on England to become a thief"" She can pull off any character so damn well. I loved all other seven  ""thieves"" as well. 😂😂😂|, The fact that Met's theme was european royalty, and Cate Blanchett's best role is Queen Elizabeth makes it soo cool, and also the fact that they are robbing at the Met Ball and Rihanna is known as The queen of Met Gala makes it even cooler!|, Does anyone actually realize this is not a remake but an actual continuation of the Ocean's franchise of movies. Sandra Bullock is literally playing his sister like they aren't remaking anything.|, Okay, I haven’t seen it yet, but I’m hoping for the best. As long as it tops Ocean’s 12, it should be good with me! However, it would be interesting if Danny is still alive and maybe shows up in a possible Ocean’s 9/10, and then some of the cast from the Ocean’s 11 trilogy team up with some of the cast from Ocean’s 8-10 for some awesome mega-heist. Maybe also throw in Benedict and Toulour as possible side antagonists/allies. Idk just a thought and I would probably like to see it!|, For those of you who have seen Ocean's 8 the picture, try to recall the last scene. Sandra sits down on a wooden bench which faces a wall of multiple engraved tombs. As she pours her beverage into a martini glass, pay close attention to the tombstone to her lowest bottom right.

Engraved into the granite facing appear the words 'Helga M. Meyer' 1992 – 2010 as the date of birth and death of the deceased. Sandra's biological mother sadly passed on April 4, 2000--her name was as it appears on the tombstone in the movie -- Helga M. Meyer.

The last words of dialog spoken as Sandy gazes directly into the camera in this final scene right before it fades to black and the end credits begin roll are-- ""you would've loved it.""

This is no coincidence. The final scene is cleverly crafted as a sentimental homage to her deceased mother who didn't get to see her daughter's best work, and who was by death denied the opportunity to witness her beloved daughter receive an Academy Award.

Although Helga may not be with you in the physical form Sandra, she will always be with you in spirit and is aware of what a remarkable woman you've become artistically-- including the adoptions of two beautiful children in desperate need of someone in this cruel world to want them, to need them, to love them.

Well done Sandra... Well done.|, Ocean’s 8 – Az évszázad átverése c. film fricska az Ocean's Eleven – Tripla vagy semmi-re, de milyen fricska!

Super recommend!|, I love this movie still makes me cry no matter how many times I watch it. It's just that good of movie imo. It's adorable sad and about growth as a person. Truly a special movie that holds a special place in my heart. We need more like this. Really makes me miss my mom and dad too. 🥺🥺 I feel so bad for her ong I wish I could just hug tightly and tell her things will get better in time. To keep your head up always and keep on pushing. Not all heroes wear capes and that's very true even now.|, This movie plays with your emotions in all the right ways. Definitely worth your time|, I hope GKIDS gets more opportunities for wider theatrical releases latter on. These international films deserve to be better renowned, and I'm glad GKIDS is making some of those early steps.|, Don't you just feel like you just want to jump into the movie and give okko a big hug? that's what I felt like when watching this .|, i cried so much... its SO good💞|, This movie made me 😭 cry!!! 100% recommended!!!|, i watched this. and talked with people who made this....its incredible!|, I highly recommend this movie!!!

Old,Old - Official Trailer [HD],A4U2pMRV9_k,34176181,237269,16164,"This is one of the most creative movies I’ve seen in a while…

Never gets old|, The scene when the father forgot why they wanted the leave the beach almost made me shed a tear, it was actually a really sad and good scene.|, My theory is M. Night Shyamalan went to the beach and swam in the ocean and his fingers got all wrinkly, and he was like “holy shit.”|, The movie had a really interesting and creative concept. I think it was good but very depressing or at least I feel depressed after watching it. Something you can definitely take out of this movie is that life is short, we should cherish it and people close to us while we still have them.|, This takes “time flies when you’re having fun” to a whole new level|, I watched this last night and what a brilliant peace of writing and direction, the concept is outstanding and the pace keeps you on the edge all the time , the child actors gave great performances and the plot twist at the end was so cool , the film was an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish and makes you realise that time is very short in a life , it gives the effect of grains of sand falling in a sand clock …..|, Plost twist: The reason time is flying by so quickly is because they're having such a good time on the beach.|, I had several moments throughout this film where I just couldn't help but laugh and so did other people in the theatre. It's indescribably silly.|, This was an awesome film in my opinion.
It was a thriller but also a metaphor for life and aging and getting older. It was a nice mix of both scary thriller moments but heartfelt emotional moments.|, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It kept me entertained and invested all the way through. It's an interesting concept, a fresh idea and the acting is pretty good as well. Cinematography was also great, there were some super creative shots."
Old Fashioned,How I Make an Old Fashioned | the ONE cocktail you must know,pdcrJ5V7YKM,2539089,69824,1573,"Hey everyone!  I realize the E.H. Taylor is quite pricey - it's gone up significantly in recent days (I can't even find it anymore). Just a quick note that you do not have to use this; use your favorite bourbon/whiskey (Very Old Barton is an affordable higher proof alternative). You do want a relatively decent spirit as it is a simple cocktail, but use what works for you! Your drink, your bottle, your choice. Cheers 🥃😊✌️|, I was at a bar once, and I heard an older gentleman order an old fashioned.  While waiting, he looked straight at me and said ""I'm so old, when I first started drinking, these were just called fashioned's"".  I'll never forget that joke.|, Enjoying one now, followed your recipe to the letter, including made my own Demerara syrup. Best old fashioned I’ve ever had. Seriously. Thanks Anders, a home run!|, I've had good luck using agave syrup for the sweetener, and I've even used maple syrup during the winter months for an interesting flavor.  Ryes work well for these too.   I've also gotten in the habit of using a dash or two of Fee Brothers orange bitters instead of the orange slice since it gives that very nice orange kick while keeping the drink totally clear and un-clouded.|, As a bourbon drinker, this is my favorite cocktail. Adding a Luxardo cherry (or two) really puts it over the top! :)|, Made my first old fashioned with this recipe today and it turned out real good! I used Knob Creek bourbon and Barrel Roll Demerara syrup 🤗|, Maple syrup and black walnut bitters, with either bourbon or rum as your spirit. Soooo delicious. I'd imagine that orange would go great with it as well!|, I've been experimenting with the Old Fashioned lately and what I've found taste the best for me is replacing the sugar cube or demerara with a bar spoon of pure maple syrup. The sweet maple notes with the bourbon is absolutely incredible and now my preferred old fashioned.|, Anders, lately, instead of sugar or simple syrup, I've been using the ginger syrup that I learned how to make from your channel, and frankly, it's my new favorite Old Fashioned|, I  find using maple syrup taste so much better than simple syrup for some of the drinks. Thanks for sharing these great cocktail recipes! 🤩"
Old Henry,OLD HENRY Official Trailer (2021),BZc4PVVd-0w,1880424,18092,1964,"I love it when you can take a handful of characters, a simple location, and then tell a story that knocks your socks off. This is what storytelling is all about. Kudos to everyone involved with this movie!|, I love it when they choose characters that look like real everyday people. Makes the experience feel more real and grounded.|, Just saw this movie.  Hands down the best movie since before the Pandemic.  I haven't seen a movie this good in years.  The next day I watched it again.|, Anyone else completely floored by this film? The visual of Old Henry moving through the brush, totally one with it, was incredible. Like a human mirage being filmed. 

Fell in love with this one within the first 10 minutes. It's a modern Greek tragedy.|, In the time of streaming services pumping out movies and shows on a weekly basis, Old Henry is a true gem. This one will stay with me. Anyone wondering to watch, wonder no further. If it came out in the 90s, it would be a classic by now. Hats off to Potsy Ponciroli, Tim Blake Nelson and everyone else that were involved in producing this masterpiece.|, This was an awesome movie.  Just a plain, simple story with some mystery, grit, and action.  Great acting, good script, and really cool turn at the end that I personally didn't see coming although maybe I should have, lol.  No politics, no unnecessary drama, just a straightforward to-the-point western.|, Tim Nelson, he has come a long way and the fact that he gets his own movie, the lead and its an action movie? 
Yeah, this is worth the watch i feel. 
Really awesome to see him.|, I had zero expectations for this movie but it was a GREAT western. The performances, cinematography, score, story, all of it was a pleasant surprise. Fantastic film.|, One of the absolute best movies I've seen in a long time. The fact that it has a different outcome of a historical figure and portrays them in a different light makes you wonder how their life truly ended 🤔. Some say they died young, but this says they died later in life. Either way, this was an excellent and entertaining movie from start to beginning. I rarely watch movies, but I've watched Old Henry twice because I missed some of the significance that makes this movie a true gem💎.|, One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Genuine, deep acting. Nelson always delivers, his soul is like gravity that weighs down on you every time he speaks. No woke nonsense. Just a fantastic film."

At the last scene, I was yelling at my screen ""Oh, come on Ezra!. Seriously???""|, the movie was kinda intense and i felt bad for the girl, just imagine two people who cross paths with eachtoher and are suited but cant be together..... thats what your gonna get from this film.... typical story of star crossed lovers|, This was soooooo goood|, Good cute movie.

Love the title and the idea.|, I actually saw this movie with a bunch of friends yesterday, and it was actually really good. It was very intense, especially at the end. Sure, the beginning did start a bit slow, but once that first airplane came into that picture.. we were basically glued to the screen for the rest of the movie. Even if it was predictable, it was really good (and at times, seemed very realistic).|, I know it's easy to nitpick and be critical of media and all it's details, but if you just slightly turn your brain down and don't compare every detail to real life, man this movie is actually crazy awesome! It's got some really intense and crazy action scenes, and even the actual plot and pacing is really tight!|, one of the most hardcore action movies this year, trust me. Just saw it a few hrs ago. The whole crowd applauded at the end. It does bring back that Die Hard 1 concept but a huge part of nowadays generation wouldn't even know Die Hard 1. As a whole, it was an awesome movie. Enjoy|, One of my favorite movies and one of my favorite trailers.

Unless you're a kid, you probably shouldn't because it'll scare the crap out of you|, I'VE WATCHED THIS MOVIE 6 TIMES NOW. I LOVE IT SO MUCH I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT.|, This movie was actually really good, and not just because Morgan Freeman is in it. For those who haven't watched it, I recommend you give it a try!|, Just finished watching it again, one of the best movies till this day."
On Chesil Beach,ON CHESIL BEACH | Official Trailer,ZR6DWDfMDlM,2719283,4064,259,"Christ almighty, Saoirse is spectacularly beautiful in this film. Her acting is also just incredible. There's a scene near the end of the film where Edward is calling her a fraud and frigid and the look of pure anguish, hurt and devastation on her face is unreal. I don't think I've seen another actor or actress display those emotions in such a masterful, convincing way. It tore my soul in two when I saw her in such emotional pain in that scene, that's when you know an actor is good, when it makes you almost cry for them. Also, I am madly and hopelessly in love with Florence, everything about her is perfect.|, This movie broke my heart. the ending just blew my mind away. i cried so hard. this movie is a good reminder of why we should never let argues and issues set us apart. because sometimes we really can regret it for the rest of our lives. if you love them and its real love, don't give up on it!|, This movie is really amazing, it inspires every one attempting to success from the first attempt, judging the thing impossible to be reached, everything in life consists of a bad beginning , things can't go perfect from the first time trying, we have to be patient, to go step by step until the purpose is reached and all the past will become just memories, good ones that bring up a soft, nostalgic, thankful smile.|, This looks very interesting. I love Saoirse so much. She’s such a wonderful actress, a delight on screen.|, This looks like it will be an amazing and beautiful film. Saoirse Ronan has quickly become one of my favorite actresses.|, I just finished the book in half a day, I could not stop reading. I hope this movie will do it justice ! But I trust Saoirse Ronan, I am sure it will be an amazing movie !|, Wonderful film adapted beautifully from the book.  Goes to show we never know what a difference a single moment can make in our lives.  The effects ripple...…..maybe forever.|, El final me rompió :'( preciosa película.|, No doubt this would be another amazing performance by Saoirse|, It is way more heartbreaking than ATONEMENT. Another masterpiece by Ian!"
On the Basis of Sex,ON THE BASIS OF SEX | Official Trailer | Focus Features,28dHbIR_NB4,11587253,39111,2267,"“Who was it for, if not for me?” is my favourite line in this film. You can tell this is what made her come back fighting after being told to give up, she knew she needed to put the changes in motion that would allow her daughter the opportunities she was denied based on her gender.|, Every time I watch the movie I can't stop thinking about the fact that this was only like 50 years ago, it wasn't too long we were fighting against laws that are highly unconstitutional... I would like to thank all the generations that made this change possible|, I have watched this trailer so many times, and I tear up each time. Such a wonderful story about this amazing, trailblazing woman who was brave enough to take it all the way to the Supreme Court on several occasions to change the letter of the law. And props to her husband for being such a supportive partner to her throughout his life. CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS! Notorious RBG!|, This film is so incredibly good. :) I was crying by the final court scene. It's amazing to see how much has changed in such a short time thanks to women like RBG.|, Discrimination on the basis of sex period is/was unjust. RBG was a genius to showcase how EVERYONE loses in an unjust system. RBG fought the proper fight for both men and women to be allowed to take on all roles in greater society. RIP LEGEND! Also, Marty is the dream partner <3 RBG worked hard but she was quite blessed with a great support team!|, Me watching this makes me proud, also realized that we should all be greatful and remember the people who fought for gender equality and for women rights. Hard to believe it wasn’t that long ago when people think this way.|, ""The law assumes a caregiver has to be a woman. This is sex-based discrimination against a MAN."" 
Very well said. This prejudice of fixed gender roles has, to this day, pressured so many men from exercising their well-deserved right to participation in housework and childcare (e.g. in many countries still, men are publicly shamed for washing dishes and changing diapers) and driven so many divorce cases to the separation of loving fathers and their children because, importantly (not saying this is the only reason), mothers are assumed to be naturally better caretakers and, in reality, are indeed often better because they have also been pressured to compromise their work/career for childcare and so, of course, are more knowledgeable and skilled at something they've been practicing for a long time. 

All those angry men's rights activists really should spend more time and energy on fighting against traditional gender identity&roles because that is where truly lies the cause of the injustices they are suffering from.|, We lost a titan last night. May she rest in peace. I have not cried this hard for the death of someone I have never met. She was a national treasure.|, Rest in peace, RBG - what a brilliant, resilient, intrepid, profound, and powerful voice of wisdom. Forever notorious, forever loved, and missed.|, I just watched this film and ended up loving it and right now I'm reading a book based on her life, so good too! 😍👩🏻‍⚖️🙌🏼"

You have a voice that needs to be heard. You're special and the world needs to Hear You cause thats what the world needs, some corny ass raps.|, Is this a remake of 8 mile?

Once I Was a Beehive,Once I Was a Beehive,FEv5adGbMJs,0,26560,3182,"I find this movie comforting in a way. I loved church camp when I was able to go. I also feel like this captures the essence of church camp in the sense of community and togetherness.|, I just lost my father a couple months ago. This movie really hit at the end. Just everyone please don’t take anything for granted. Please give Somone you love a hug and tell them you love them. I would do anything possible for one last minute with my Dad. Please take care of your loved ones. Go shoot your shot with the person you like. Go do that one thing you were always to scared to do. Live life while it lasts. Please tell Somone you love them today❤️|, I am a part of this religion! We watched this when we were younger for a church activity when we weren't allowed to go to girls camp yet! I am old enough now and I look forward to girls camp. It's the most exciting part of my year. I am going again soon for 4 days! BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!😍🥰|, This movie was beautiful and spoke to me in volumes spiritually. I would like to thank the person that created it and YouTube for providing it. I pray everyone is having a great day and to look up to the good things in life instead of the struggles during these tough times....after all this quarantine allows us the time to renew our faith|, I adore this movie, and I’m a Mormon Christian and I loved that they made a movie that displays my church and the kindness people have. When ever I wanna feel happy or inspired I always come to this movie for that peace.💜💜✝️|, One of the most touching movies I have seen in long time! This is the ONE and only thing I miss about being part of a church is the feeling of togetherness and community. Who knows I might be open to joining a church sometime soon. Thanks for this!|, I first found this with my sister years ago and we both laughed at the title, and said ""why not"" in an hour we were both crying.|, Makes me miss my Girls Camp days. We had open wooden sleep shelters instead of tents, but we also had a larger group (I think roughly 100 girls from 3 different cities), and instead of a ""Trial of Faith"" we had certification and if you completed all six years you got your tree medallion in the Liahona ceremony. There were SO MANY yearly traditions...
I'm also touched on a personal level because I recognize that pain of grief. Some years ago my dad passed away the same year we found out he had cancer, and very recently I lost my own support dog. It was cathartic, watching this movie.
And it's so true—Girls Camp is a ""had to be there"" experience to understand it!|, This movie is so Nostalgic for me, i just converted back to Christianity and my main memory of being a Christian when I was younger was always watching this movie every Sunday, it was the only movie I ever wanted to watch because it was so amazing to my little brain🙏🏻❤️|, I loved this movie. I actually liked the fact that the mom was able to fall in love again. Like apart from that year after his death, they knew beforehand that he was gonna die, it wasn't something unexpected. also the fact that she found someone in a group for people who lost a spouse to cancer, sounds honestly really nice because Tristan had gone through to something so similar to her experience. Additionally, I don't doubt that her mom and Tristan made an effort to include lane in their activities like he calls lane sweetie and is able to give input in decisions about Lane.  Once he realizes that he was most definitely not welcome he left to give them space. I think her mom was pretty great except for the not telling you for 3 weeks thing lol"

They wanted to make sure the newer guys were as far away from the fire as they could possibly be in such a small area, just to try and give them that tiniest extra chance of survival. Absolutely heartbreaking|, I met a veteran who had served in Afghanistan when I saw this movie in theaters. Real nice guy but honestly one of the most physically intimidating people I've ever been around. He looked absolutely unshakable. When we reached this scene, most of the theater, myself included, was crying or trying their hardest not to. I looked at the veteran and he was *SOBBING* louder than anyone in that theater. I'm talking head-in-his-hands-puffy-face-big-man-ugly crying.  I've never had a scene shake me to my core like this one did.  It's nothing short of cinematic brilliance.|, The way he stutters when he says “I’ll talk to you when we’re in the- the shelters” like he’s breaking down knowing that he’s about to die is just absolutely insane. It’s even more insane when you learn that’s exactly how the original audio recording went|, I’m a wildland firefighter in Eugene Oregon. This was a terrible tragedy that should never have happened, I feel immensely for the men and woman and the families involved. I will wear the pack twice as hard for these hotshots, and do the job as best as I can in their name|, One of the saddest things I read from this was from the sole survivor (the lookout from their group who watched the fire from a distance from them and retreated with another group) where he described sitting in the truck after they had found the bodies and crying. He kept hearing all of their phones going off in the truck from their loved ones trying to see if they were okay but had to leave the truck because it was too much for him. Brendon McDonough|, The last 20 minutes of this movie is one of the most gut wrenching, devastating, upsetting, sad things in all movies. They did a fantastic job with this movie and honoring these hero’s. I’m so sorry for their loss|, They're still not forgotten. Many of us in Prescott knew these men and considered them brothers. Their hotshot crest still flies high on all buildings, Goverment vehicles, and more. Bless these men|, The moment before this scene where Brolin realizes they are trapped is so gut wrenching, the look on his face says it all, incredible movie|, My heart dropped when Marsh was scouting ahead and saw the front immediately shift towards them at high pace. His expression was heart breaking when he saw it, and he looked back at his men who were completely unaware.|, 1:31 that stutter sent chills down my spine he knows he probably won't make it and he is on the verge of tears."

The emotions of interacting with a man responsible for killing millions of ur people was portrayed so well! The interactions between peter and eichmenn were so intense with so little words..|, Brilliant film that I saw today. You know how terrific a film is when you forget that you are watching actors doing their thing. Entire cast did a wonderful job with Sir Ben always giving an A-plus.|, 1:40 “if you succeed for the first time in our history, we will judge our executioner” That line really hit me hard!!!!!!’|, What a great actor Ben Kingsley is! He can do any character! We don't see him, but the character he plays. A classic actor.|, This is what we call an amazing trailer, building up the tempo and giving us a perfect glimpse of what the film would offer us! I already expect a blockbuster!|, Evil man, the architect of  operation finale.. even more chilling because it’s based on a real life event. It’s a fantastic movie.|, I'm always down for a story that involves people from WW2.|, Was a bit slow at times, but to tell the overall story it was necessary. One plot device was kind of drawn out, but overall a really good flick. 

Ben Kingsley and Oscar Issac give very powerful performances, but the whole ensemble did a good job.

The story is told well and had several on-your seat moments.|, ""I beg you...do not fail."" You can feel the weight of that sentence.|, My great uncle was in the Mossad that captured him. The story is incredible."
Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre,"Operation Fortune (2023) Official Trailer – Jason Statham, Aubrey Plaza, Hugh Grant",WdZ-BWWQcWQ,19671931,54032,1762,"I'll never get tired of jason statham in action movies|, This movie was really a breath of fresh air. Loved the dynamic between all the actors and especially the humor between Plaza and Statham. I really enjoyed it!|, I must admit I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Aubrey and Jason sold the ticket as they are both favorites of mine. Jason did exactly as expected and  gave his solid  action movie performance. I expected it and got it. I have been a fan  of  Aubrey Plaza  for years and always thought she was  being cast just for her  ability to  sell awkward. After ""Emily the  Criminal"" I knew she was  breaking out of the  mold she had been cast into. Congrats Aubrey! I hope this  pairing can  continue  with a ""Mission Improbable"" series. I enjoyed  my time at the  theater and they sold some Popcorn and a  drink along with the ticket. This is how it is supposed to be for movies to  survive!|, That's one of those perfect movies from start to finish. Not too much humour, great action, no forced casting, no political message, no biased opinion disguised as a punchline... just great entertainment !! Reminded me of Mission : Impossible because of the dynamic between the teammates. The photography is pleasant, costumes are amazing, classy. Well, there's Jason Statham in it as the icing on the cake. I'll give it a 9/10|, Just seen the movie, as expected Guy Ritchie never disappoints. Hugh Grant plays a brilliant character brilliantly.|, Jason Statham and Aubrey Plaza's sense of humor is a perfect match|, You know it's that good when you see Jason Statham and come back to watch the trailer|, By far Hugh Grant was the star of this movie with his amazing acting skills, just like in The Gentlemen the character he plays is devious and yet funny, as for the other actors they pretty much play themselves in an action role.|, Brilliant! Love Guy Ritchie and his movies. This deserved a theatrical release so glad they are honouring it! 🍿🥤|, Saw it high af🌿 and will give it a 10/10!!! It had the James bond espionage vibe going on along with the Archer quips/ humor of the secret spies all bantering with one another. It may not be for everyone, but I will argue it will be a cult classic to those who are open-minded or love the spy genre. 🤵🏽‍♂️"

Profond respect pour eux. Hélas je ne peux pas en dire autant de ma propre communauté (peut-on vraiment appeler ça une communauté) qui s'est jambon-beurisé en seulement 3 générations. Ca ne sait plus parler espagnol, ça donne des prénoms zemourisés à ses enfants, ça prononce son nom de famille à la française (Jurado, au lieu de le prononcer Roulado, disent Juradeau ou alors préfèrent prononcer leur nom à l'italienne comme un certain agent immobilier sur M6). Ils changent même leurs prénoms une fois naturalisés (coucou Gerard🇨🇵 Hernandez et Anne🇨🇵 Hidalgo). Et le pire dans tout ça c'est qu'ils s'en foutent littéralement de leur pays d'origine. Ca se prend plus 🇨🇵 que le 🇨🇵 moyen au point d'en devenir xénophobe et de reproduire ce que sa propre famille (qu'il renierait volontiers) a subi en arrivant en France. Quelle honte !

Ever since I was young, I had heard this song once, never remembered the lyrics, or knew who made it. It stayed in my head for years and years, and eventually I started singing the lyrics that I thought I heard to the melody of this song that I hummed. Only recently had I rediscovered this song, and the nostalgia was crazy. Never had I experienced something that had brought back that much of my childhood to me. This song makes me feel happy, and puts my mind in what feels like a different place. Thank you Lumineers.|, If you pay attention to the timing, the pacing and obviously his movements.. This video (and song,) are perfection. Pure art. This is what music is supposed to be like, as well as music videos. Simple, pure, and true.|, I, I, when I was younger
I, I, should have known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back
I, I, got a new girlfriend
She feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blinders
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love
I, I, got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small
Honey, I love you, that's all she wrote
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love|, Every single movement in this video is so perfectly timed with the song. It's a work of art. Just incredible.|, this song has such a weird effect on me, like I feel genuine happiness and sadness pouring through me everytime I listen to it|, I remember discovering this song exactly 6 years ago. So many memories, so many good people left since then... time is cruel.|, Is it just me or when the piano part and the ohelia part makes my heartbeat beat so hard as if feeling this song? I always feel like this song makes me feel everything sadness, nostalgia, happiness, and confusion. I teared up without knowing while hearing this song.|, It's been 7 years since this song was made and its still amazing"
Oppenheimer,Oppenheimer | New Trailer,uYPbbksJxIg,65346069,794728,32102,"Murphy has been loyal to Nolan for nearly two decades. It's about time he was given his own film. This might just be the film that gets both these men their respective Oscars. No more than they deserve. Can't wait for this.|, As someone with pretty severe ADHD, the fact that I sat in the IMAX with rapt attention never looking away from the screen speaks volumes. A brilliant movie.|, This movie really makes you feel that if you want to achieve something, you've got to be all in, focusing on the right stuff and making friends who are into the same thing|, Not sure if anyone else felt this but 20 minutes prior to them testing the bomb, did you feel like like some impending doom? Like what this man just created will be the end of this world? The music, the tension, and the acting was one of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed in a movie. It was almost like a sense of fear.|, You know a Movie is good when you come back to the Trailers.|, Me and my friends loved this movie. Wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't passionate about science or don't like complicated movies,that require a lot of focus to be understood. It was also pretty emotional, I started crying in the end. One of the best movies I've seen.|, Cillian absolutely deserves to be the lead in a movie like this. Long overdue.|, Amazing how almost every line in this film can be a quote of its own. Such masterful dialogue writing!|, The cast, the script, the cinematography  - A MASTERPIECE. Highly recommend this movie,|, Went to see this recently. Man...... the visuals and the cerebral feelings throughout using music and sound FX were just a work of art. Huge props to the visual effects, the costume designers, the music supervisors, and of course the directing. Creating a movie where many people already know the outcome is always a little bit harder. The immediate thought is, ""I know what the outcome of the atomic bomb was"". But to recreate the events in a way that makes you wonder what might happen next, as well as capturing the manic/genius side of Robert Oppenheimer throughout was a piece of movie-making genius. It's one of those movies film schools will definitely reference when teaching people how to add emotion to various scenes."
Orphan: First Kill,ORPHAN: FIRST KILL | Official Trailer | Paramount Movies,_uX6of3vBu0,10816695,146983,6562,"Can't wait to watch this one!!|, I never thought they’d make a prequel. Esther’s story has always had a soft spot in my heart.|, It's a very well made prequel. It's as much exciting as the first movie. The twist in the middle is really smart and unexpected. Isabelle Fuhrman is really talented. And I gotta give Julia Stiles some credit for her very decent performance.|, I love this movie! Rather than comparing it with the first movie that came out in 2009, I’m just happy that they actually made a new part with the same actress. There is no need to compare which one is better than the other. Both are great, and both are about the same story. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️|, I remember watching the first one in theatres as a senior in highschool (17) and now im 30... things like this is just mind blowing. Seeing Isabelle Fuhrman as a child portraying an adult then and now a full grown adult portraying a child, the same character, is really wild.|, OMG, I just finished this and it was BRILLIANT! I swear the twist in this movie was something I never would've imagined, especially looking at the trailer. I would've figured it would've been like Orphan but boy was I wrong! Isabelle Fuhrman again nailed it as Ester. I think she did better than the first time, especially since she's older now.|, I felt like the first movie slipped under so many people's radar because it was not much talked about. People thought it was your run-of-the-mill child possession horror movie but the plot twist was something so refreshing and unexpected. I know it left me stunned when all was revealed. This sequel looks promising as well. Can't wait to see it!|, I didn't expect the plot twist. Her performance in this is amazing.|, Prequel was actually suprisingly good. I'm not fond of prequels to begin with nor the director behind this film due to his lack of good movies,but he finally made one that's not just really good,but damn near close with the first. The ongoing story line was well written,the midway twist had my jaw on the floor for 5 mins,Fuhrman did a really good job reprising her role and the rest of the cast did well too,and I thought the editing tricks to make her look shorter and younger were done right. Film completely blew me away. First 30 mins were fine and it had a few cheap editing tricks that bugged me,but other than that,film was solid,bat shit crazy,and really fun 90 minutes.|, To my surprise, this was a really good prequel and one of the better ones out there. It has a really good twist you don’t see coming. At first, it thought it would be unnecessary, but I’m glad we got it!"

It was worth it based on the cast alone. One of the more underrated movies of the past few years from director Scott Cooper.  He also directed “Crazy Heart” and the also underrated “Black Mass”…👍👍|, Christian bale is severely underrated as an actor. His batman franchise was great, but movies like this are what really brings out his talent.|, Excellent movie.  Very sad at times, and super charged with intense scenes.   

The part where Bale sees the deer, and does not shot it, was an identical scene in the film, Deer Hunter, with Robert D Nero.  

This was one of the best, if not the best film I have watched in the past few years.  

Take the time to watch it people.  Hello from Edmonton, Canada.|, Bale, Harrelson, Affleck, and Dafoe - exceptional performances.  Harrelson played a really scary, unpredictable, and nasty role.  Great movie!|, Simply outstanding. Not an easy movie to watch at times but the reward is a masterfully told human story...of 2 brothers. It's unflinching and gritty yet loaded with heart (and talent).|, If people were aware of all the great movies you put out, you'd have millions of subscribers. You'll get there.|, Damn good movie!!!  Watching it again, from Winnipeg, Canada.  Even the opening song by Eddie Vedder gets me!  ( out of all the roles that I've seen Woody Harrelson act, this is by far the most memorable for me)|, Stellar performance by Woody Harrelson. Outstanding cast. Dont miss this one.|, What a great movie,with a strong male protagonist on the lead like Christian Bale with stellar supporting cast was a BLAST—- Zoe Zlaldana, Sam Sheppard,Woody Harrelson, Casey Afflect, bartender actor and the chief of police ( So sorry I forgot their names very good actors). Such a powerful film.  I have never expected This GREAT.  Christian Bale is the REAL DEAL. Cheers to all performers. How I wish THAT VIEWERS WILLSEE AND WATCH THIS FILM,  Thank you 🙏 Great job."

NO SPOILERS Review!,DM0jbgsIvwg,38467,6426,770,"It's rare and surreal to hear Doomcock sound so actually happy with a movie, I may have to give this one a go.|, You’re right it’s a top 3 Godzilla film hands down! EVERYONE needs to see this movie!!! The budget was only 15 million we gotta show Hollywood they can screw themselves !!! THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE PERIOD it’s past the “monster” genre in this adaptation|, Actually, large parts of Godzilla is done with CGI in this movie. And it only took $15 million dollars to look this superb. Not 100, 200, but FIFTEEN. Hollywood has no excuses anymore.|, The CGI was so good it made Doomcock believe it was a guy in a suit. I said the same thing with Shin Godzilla until finding out it was CGI.  Really goes to show the talent this team had.|, Minus One not only takes elements of some of the best Godzilla films (54, 84, 2000, GMK, Shin) but even resurrects promising aspects brought up in other, more overlooked films in the franchise (Godzilla Raids Again, Vs King Ghidorah, etc) and not only improves on them but even SHOWS us things that were only ever implied or just explained through exposition in the past. Heck it even one-ups the Jurassic Park movies of recent years at one point and it took me by surprise how well done it was. The human characters are shockingly good too, probably the best ones we’ve had in a very long time, and setting it in the 40s post-WW2 worked to their benefit, and I liked how what messages and allegories that were presented were nuanced and the movie does not feel like a petulant lecture when it happens. I hope Yamazaki gets his wish and we get another film from him, preferably a sequel because Minus One deserves it, and I’m tired of Toho doing just one-offs like they have done these past 10 years.|, THIS was how you combine the human story with Godzilla. Some of it was hokey but it's an epic overall. Should be nominated for awards between the sound, the editing, etc. I honestly dont know how a film with this budget did atomic explosions better than Oppenheimer.|, I own every Godzilla film, I’m a huge lifelong fan since the early 1980’s. This movie is grounded in history and is the absolute best Godzilla movie dare I say period. Yes goji 54 is the most important and always will be but this film is the best one. I cared about everything and everyone in this film it’s truly unbelievably great. Movie of the year!!!|, When you stated that there are no politics in this movie it kind of struck me odd.  It's not that there aren't any politics in this movie, the movie actually makes a huge effort to AVOID politics.  It actually establishes plausible reasons to remove politics entirely as a subplot, and it certainly is a strength of it's message.  It's yet another way that Minus One focuses on the human interactions and the strength that can come from the individuals working together for a common goal despite their differences.  Yet another reason to love this movie.|, They could have made the exact same movie, but substitute Godzilla-saurus for an American air raid at the beginning and this would still have been a good movie even without Godzilla at all. I really liked all these characters and the story setup. However, Toho one upped this with absolutely fantastic scenes of destruction!|, I felt like the CGI of Godzilla was on par with the practical effects of the old ones.  That is a HUGE compliment.  I felt they were trying to recreate those black and white ones and they succeeded.  Godzilla has this dead look (maybe poor choice of words) in his eyes that is terrifying.  Godzilla walking straight is so ominous.  I was not a fan of the older design but now I see a lot of good things about it."
Oz the Great and Powerful,OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL | Full Trailer | Official Disney UK,DylgNj4YQVc,8221036,21737,1316,"I love the concept of how the audience will get to experience the film in cinemas. The director explained that during the black and white phase of the film, everything would be in 2D, however the screen would expand and the 3D would be turned on when you enter Oz. This seriously sounds awesome, and I can't wait to experience it.|, I like this movie :) Whoever is disappointed that it was not like the original.....it's because it's NOT about Dorthy duh! It's about the how the Wizard came to be. I love how they put it together, it's a great family film with lots of fun and color :)|, James Franco can never do anything wrong.  And Sam Raimi is an amazing director.  Awesome cast, beautiful set design, great back story.  Loved it!|, this movie was so well done. i loved every minute of it, i was smiling the entire time in my seat. |, This movie was so good! I loved every minute of it and could watch it over and over and it would never get old!|, I love this movie I saw it three times in the theatre and it STILL hasn't gotten old. :)|, This movie is so underrated|, I actually like what they have done here! Great insight to the beloved story and James Franco looks awesome as the wizard.. Looking forward to this!|, This was surprisingly one of the best films I've seen in quite some time.|, Everything Disney touch immediately transfers into magical,brilliant,out of this world work of art! Disney is probably one of the greatest things that have happened to Earth! Spectacular,just how much imagination,emotions and hard-work they put in everything they do.Every time I see ‘Disney film’ Im sure that it is not just a film. It’s a real,powerful emotional experience and they have never failed to prove the world that real things are only those who can be felt with the heart. Thank you!"

I'm so excited to cover all of this this week!|, Lack of lore aside, the quality and presentation of this event were borderline marvelous.|, Awesome work from you and your team for popping this out so fast. I’m glad I got to at least watch the event the same day but they didn’t plan for the volume of people trying to get online at all 😂 either got put in Que for hours and when I tried to get on it had an error and put me into another que 😅|, That end…quite literally everything the storyline has been building up to. The first arc is done, now it’s time to see where Epic brings us next…|, Sypher, you’ve been making good content for years, and I appreciate it. I’m proud of how far you’ve gotten. Keep up the good work❤❤❤|, I'm excited for the Fall Guys collab and the Lego and arcade racer modes. I also had no idea there was going to be a Rock Band game of sorts being introduced. Chapter 5 is going to be mad. There will be so much going on. This was my first live event and it was well made, but it's a shame the Eminem part was short. They could have done more songs and sequences.|, Everyone is thanking sypher for his hard work but let's appreciate his editor jack for editing every video of his within like 2 hours. Mad respect|, The fact that you got 270,000 viewers and 70,000 subscribers and just a few minutes is crazy I’m so happy that you got this success especially from this live stream|, Congrats on hitting 8 mil! That must be a huge achievement. I was on your stream when you hit it. Once again congrats Sypher and I hope you'll continue to develop and create great content for us!"
Pacific Rim,Gipsy Danger vs Leatherback - Fight Scene - Pacific Rim (2013) Movie Clip HD,dLptjP1RKmQ,5932365,66920,3146,"It's a shame Pacific Rim never got a sequel. This is peak Kaiju fighting. One of the best monster movies ever made.|, The way Charlie screams in this movie is just so realistic. You’re in big mechs and giant monsters are screaming and charging at you so the way Charlie delivers his lines just makes it that much better. “EMPTY THE CLIP! EMPTY THE CLIP!” I wish they made a sequel.|, You can really FEEL the impact of the blows, this movie was a masterpiece|, A lot of people complain that action movies have their fight scenes take place at night, but Pacific Rim actually makes that work in its favor. The Jaegers' headlamps and the Kaiju's visceral bioluminescence makes everything just...pop.|, I really love how each Kaiju also has their own personality. Leatherback is easily pissed off and lost his cool. Otachi doesn’t like a upfront attack and prefers to ambush its opponents and it goes into hiding every time the situation isn’t going too well for her. Otachi is also the smarter Kaiju of the two.|, What makes this incredible is that the Kaiju hivemind thought they killed Gipsy Danger long ago. This is a ghost that they didn't plan for never thought it could come back. But it has and it is stronger.|, This movie was absolutely incredible. It deserves a respectable sequel, not the plastic sci fi original movie that it got.|, Man, this film didn't just made me see a titan fight but also made me feel it. The sounds and the close-ups fit perfectly not only with the giants, but also how they interact with the environment. The crashing against the buildings, the stomping on the cracking cement roads, the sound of the waves, it's so realistic that it makes you think they're absolutely real. As a giant robot fan, I want that feeling again|, This was what I loved about Pacific Rim, that mechanical, clunky, robotic feeling from those fights. The mechs seem very clunky and mechanical, which I love because it makes it feel that it isn't a gundam mech where none of those mechs ever pay attention to details. Uprising doesn't even deserve having pacific Rim in its title, Uprising is honestly just a gundam copy done poorly.|, This battle is amazing.

When newt drifted with the kaiju brain, the precursors were able to see the plan to nuke the breach with striker, typhoon and cherno. Because of that, they sent out 2 kaiju that specifically counters all 3 jaegers. Otachi has a sharp tail to rip off the small head of typhoon, acid breath to tear down cherno's thick armor, and leatherback as an emp to disable striker's electric core and to tear apart cherno with brute force.

On the other hand, gipsy was a last minute launch, meaning the precursors didnt have a counter for Gipsy, making her at a huge advantage. Also the fact raleigh and mako are the types of fighters to quickly analyze the kaiju's main weapon, they stood no chance fighting gipsy"
Pacific Rim: Uprising,Pacific Rim: Uprising Trailer #1 (2018) | Movieclips Trailers,_EhiLLOhVis,11778874,103612,13807,"First thoughts on the trailer for the new Pacific Rim?|, This trailer is 100% better than the movie|, This trailer is incredible! It is so well put together. Im satisfied with rewatching this because Ive heard the movie wasnt too good, but damn. HUGE props to the person that put the trailer together with the music and the timing.|, The new Jaegers are way to quick in my opinion. In the old one it seemed like the robots had actual power behind when they winded up for a punch or something|, I would watch pacific rim again in theaters, if they play the first movie! The first movie was so very awesome! <3|, The thing about the original is the characters are really awesome and well developed. Raleigh was so supportive towards Mako and their relationship could be both romantic or not-romantic and it's still believable and the sweetest thing. Also I still consider the sparring session between Raleigh and Mako is more intimate than any sex scene on movie ever lol. Hope they won't botch the plot and chara-dev. If it's about the action scenes I'm pretty much easy to impress but I'm whiny about plot and chara-dev lol|, Let’s all agree that the trailer is better than the movie|, I want this to be good! Please be better than Transformers First Knight|, Words cannot describe how cool and badass this looks! I loved the first one so much and I love the idea where Pentecost had a son who ends up taking up his father's mantle of asskicking some Kaiju butt! Also, I like that Hermann and Newt are coming back because I loved them in the first film!|, I hope that this will never stop giving me chills and bring me back to a childhood where all giant robots and giant monsters fighting on the big screen were the biggest of the world's problems."

Deepika’s beauty is nothing infront of her in the scene where aditi welcomes her 🥺♥️✨|, The ending part got me emotional 😭|, This is another magnificent and lavish production from the director. An absolute feast for the eyes. It would have also been for the soul if it had English subtitles, like the other movies, so it would have been accessible to more people. It sure was a nuisance having to read the plot on Wikipedia while trying to work it out on screen. A truly stunning movie anyway 😍|, The best performance of Sahid Kapoor. 
And Hats off to Rawal Ratan Singh the man who died for the honor his wife.|, Blown away by such beautiful cinematography and wonderful acting!|, Um clássico recomendo. Parabéns 🎉🎊🍾🎈|, I wish there was a subtitle. I'm so mesmerized by the dance breaks in this masterpiece of a movie. :)|, Tuve la suerte de verla subtitulada cuando recién salió.

Pain & Gain,Pain and Gain Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Michael Bay Movie HD,SEQ8jyvmYtw,23025567,68014,6938,"This is one of those movies that is simply perfectly done.
The fact this is a true story too and portrayed so well is also great. The soundtrack alone is worth a listen.|, This movie is a chaotic, sick, twisted masterpiece. The acting is phenomenal and the directing was amazing. Top 5 movie imo|, This is, in my opinion, Michael Bay's best movie by far. He really was trying to make a fun and actually thought-provoking film. But critics walked into it wanting to hate it, and if it had anyone else's name in the credits, I bet they would have been more receptive of it. Thankfully, I paid no mind to them: this was a damn fine film.|, I dont care what anyone says, this was a damn good movie|, I can't believe this is already ten years old. I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I thought it was incredible. So much workout motivation. The ending was so powerful too.|, This movie turned my life around, 2 years ago I was just in my room all the time watching movies, playing video games, eating very unhealthy and smoked cigarettes. While I was sitting and watching the movie I realized I need to be more healthy and careful about what I eat, I also began to run a lot and workout witch I still do this day. Stopping to smoke cigarettes was the hardest thing but I cam trough it by help from my family and friends. So that's why this movie is my favourite movie even though many people say this movie isn't about fitness I think it is about motivation to do fitness and this movie definitely motivated me to do better.|, I don't care if this movie got bad reviews, I loved it. Has great action, many funny moments, shot well and to make it all crazy it was all actually based on true events. Pretty much a GTA Miami movie :)|, Easily one of Michael Bay's best movies, and not in a 'so stupid it's awesome' way, it's a legit good movie|, honestly one of the funniest movies I ever seen and the fact it was a true story makes it even better|, probably the closest Grand Theft Auto movie we will get."
Pain and Glory,PAIN AND GLORY | Official Trailer HD (2019),pEjFOkCKb3g,772207,2532,181,"I love Almodóvar! The colors,  the story and the cast...so amazing ❤|, I've been a huge fan of Pedro Almodovar since the 1980s, and this one to me was his best in many years. Truly a masterpiece up there with All About My Mother and Talk to Her. Stunningly filmed and structured, and Antonio Banderas in a beautiful, subtle and sensitive performance, perhaps his best work ever. He was nominated for an Oscar and should have won, but it is not the kind of chew-the-scenery work that Oscars tend to favour. I returned to the cinema several times to experience it again and bring friends who had not seen it, and they all thanked me and were just stunned by the final scenes. Bravo, Pedro Almodovar.|, I feel like I’m personally responsible for half the views of this trailer. This movie was so great. I wish others will go see it and am jealous of the people who get to experience it for the first time!|, Antonio Banderas is a revelation!! It's such a nuanced performance. His eyes tell so much with just simple glances. Also, the ending of the movie was glorious, caught me completely off gaurd!|, I saw Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown when it first came out in the cinema in San Francisco way back in the 80s. I will say, one of my greatest pleasures in over 30 years has been awaiting the latest Pedro Almodovar film to come out. I am lucky to still experience this even now while awaiting Pain and Glory.|, Watched this on Tuesday during a special premiere organised by Spain Tourism and Embassy in Singapore. Wonderful film. Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz never disappoint in their superb acting capabilities. Highly recommend any one of you to go and watch this movie.|, I hope he wins the Oscar. He should at least be nominated.|, Saw it twice, quite compelling. Give an Oscar to him!|, This is what cinema is about ❤|, This film is just out of this world what a cinema and what an amazing film in love with everyone from this film and everything was just perfect 💘❤️💓"

I CAN'T HANDLE MY EMOTIONS I AM A MESS RIGHT NOW|, I don't know if it's just me but I love the ending.i think it's a good twist.usually the story would end with her forgetting who she truly is then go back to a boring life and he gets the girl.but it shows her being true to herself and not changing her path for anyone.shes a book writing her own chapters not having them write for her.|, I absolutely love this movie and the book. The story and characters are great but there's also something about how it makes you feel. It's like it taps in to unrelated feelings/thoughts. The ambience of a camping/road trip mixed with looking for something that matters to you can remind you of how you might of thought about something/had romantic feelings at the time you were on a trip in the past, etc. It connects to that even if the details are completely different. I really hope Looking for Alaska becomes a film next!|, I watched this movie since it was first released and up til now, I still watch it. It's like a tradition to me to go back to this movie every year. To remind myself of who I really am and what am capable of doing and what the world could really offer. I always invisioned myself to be someone whose successful in a very independent way without the help of any male being. No relationships, no other commitments than to myself and to the career path am taking. I thought I'd be happy if I'd end up that way only to find out that it's actually the other way around. In 2mos I'd be marrying the guy who added color to my dull and lifeless paper town. He's the greatest plot twist I could say. Well not that my chapters or pages would already be coming to an end but, we never know. I love how people in here viewed this movie/book. Lots of Love to all the people behind this master piece.💕|, it would be so cool if all of john greens books connected somehow|, The way I see it, everyone has their purpose in life and you can’t just wait for it to come to you. Margo loved to feel alive and she did that by finding herself, by testing her limits and doing what she loved. When she left, that was her leaving her present self. She was surrounded by “paper towns” and “paper people”, all of whom she saw as fake. They lived their lives as if to chase perfection and she even did that for awhile. She was the beloved popular girl with a boyfriend and a huge social stratosphere. But she realized that that stuff, those people, were her future. She left the next morning after the night with Quentin, but she left bread crumbs. They’re viewed as pieces to see her whereabouts, to where she’s gone. But she doesn’t want to go back, she wants to say that she was there in that paper town. The breadcrumbs were the memories, and the fact is she did grow up there. But she doesn’t want to stay, she wants to find herself, she wants to see what can happen if you break free from your perfectly set future and find what could actually happen. I’ve heard that things always turn out good in the end, and if they don’t, it’s not the end. So maybe Margo wouldn’t end up with her perfect boyfriend and be a housewife, but at least she could say that she chose that for herself. (PS: the reality is that things work out perfectly for some people without leaving, but others have to find what is actually meant for them).|, The Q, Ben, Radar group looks so freaking cool. I want to be in that friend group! And I am 34 years old! You can how old I am by how I'm here for the buddy comedy, which will be at least as good as the romantic dramedy bits of this movie. 

Congrats, John!

 - Hank|, The first time I saw the movie, it was awesome. Especially the part of the road trip. The whole movie felt like an adventure. And I shed a tear at the end as the main trio was splitting after graduation. I read the book after that. Even better. Great movie.|, I remember sitting in a lonely movie theater watching this movie. It was so beautiful, made me laugh and contemplate about life. I love John Green's books! Adaptations of his books have been done pretty well. I especially remember how funny the pokemon singing scene was haha|, I liked this movie. Gives that nostalgic lost desolation feeling some of us LOVE. 😊"

It's a symbol that is really used by ancient people... It's a version of the all-seeing eye.|, I love how throughout these movies that no matter what happens... They never drop the camera if you were scared like that, the camera would DROP!!|, If u guys do not like horrors u won't ever understand what it feels watching them! Still the most terrifying movies of all time! From paranormal activity 1 to 7! Holy crap!|, Adorei o trailer....imagina o filme então!
estou louca pra assistir!
|, najbardziej przewidywalny ale i tak najbardziej zajebiscie straszny film jak w zyciu widzialem.  Kiedy sie oglada wiadomo ze zaraz cos pieprznie, przygotowujesz sie na to, niby wiesz, ze sie nie przestraszysz, ale jak pierdzielnie... nasrane w gaciach|, watched this today in the cinema, it was pretty funny i shall say, but the ending was very freaky! overall enjoyed the movie and cant wait for another if it comes out x|, I saw it and to be honest, I loved it. Everybody saying it sucks or was a bad movie have their own opinions but don't spoil it for everyone else that wants to see it.|, I've watched this trailer so many times I literally have it memorized in my head.|, this is by far the best one they've made. i was impressed by this installment! very good film"
Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Horror Movie HD,zR2cc1BwdmI,4349469,23418,1743,"I find the found footage technique, unique and impressive if done well. I know many do not have the patience for this relatively new shooting style, but I believe that if you watch paranormal activity, without bias, you may come to enjoy it.

I've seen the first 3 and I think they were genuinely scary can't wait to see 4 and 5.
 :)|, the demons being showed actually makes it less scary, the reason this movie was so terrifying originally, was because they never showed the demons or anything related.|, Looks awesome, can't wait! I love the whole Series especially part 1 was amazing!|, I honestly don't get why people find the paranormal activity movies bad, I watched the first movie a couple of days ago and it scared the crap out of me. I think the acting is also really good (at least in that one), and I think it looks really real with those homevideo camera's.|, I liked the movie. I thought it moved faster than the other Paranormal Activity movies, and I was scared a few times. Something I didn't like was how they started to give Toby a face. The scariest thing varies from person to person. Your mind fills in the gaps and imagines something that actually terrifies you. I also like how the whole plot comes together in this movie. I would rate this 7.3/10 which is abnormally high for a Paranormal Activity movie.|, This looks so good! Can't wait to see it 😁|, Can't wait for it to come out!!!!|, I actually like the fact that there is no cults or multiple people being possessed. The whole ghost thing is awsome!|, One of the reasons why the PA franchise was so successful was because of the mystery of the storyline. Each instalment would give answers but raise even more questions and that’s what I loved about the movies. However, The ghost dimension really messed it all up. It tried to answer all the questions but failed by finding a cheap way to tighten loose ends. The marked ones set it up to be as if the witches were building an army with Toby, but in this one they switched it up and made it about Toby becoming human?? It just got messy. Hopefully with the new PA movie coming out it will go back to the Katie storyline or even the witches storyline.|, I was never that much into the paranormal activity movies but honestly this looks pretty good."

The ending of this gave me chills for like 5 minutes after the movie was over. I loved how they tied in the first film. So damn good|, All jokes aside, this is a really great film. The setting and characters feel very authentic|, Anyone here trying to escape the horror of coronavirus and being in quarantine by watching all the Paranormal Activity movies? I’m on this one now. I love this one, starts so funny and ends so creepy.|, I was really surprise how good this one was.   I love the way they wrote the story line in The Marked Ones.  I don't want to give any spoilers away but if your a real P.A. fan, you have to watch this, it ties in with the whole P.A story|, This movie was actually pretty good. Best one in the series imo|, i watched this movie way back when i was like 11 or 12 and for YEARS i was trying for the life of me to find it and i couldn't remember what it was called. i just remember it terrifying me and i googled main parts of it and i still couldn't find it and i finally found it again. the wave of relief i just felt is insane 😭|, Not gonna lie, the dialogue in this movie, might have been the funniest dialogue in this whole franchise|, This movie made me scream and I don’t ever get scared. Ever.|, I actually enjoyed this one as I also enjoyed then first one and kind of the second one it was interesting to watch and was refreshingly new. If you come from a superstitious background this movie is actually quite relatable!! I give 7/10|, Say what you want but I actually really liked this movie. It was WAY better than Ghost Dimension"

- Bong Joon Ho|, watched the trailer, had no idea what the hell was going on, was intrigued, watched the movie, absolutely mind blowing and amazing. came back to rewatch the trailer. this is how trailers should be.|, 1:51 I love this part because it makes it look as if there's something very dark going on but it's a comedy scene in the actual movie|, The most beautiful quote in the movie was: She's not rich because she's nice but nice because she's rich.|, The house deserved a best supporting actor nomination|, “Once you overcome one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” - Bong Joon Ho|, This was the most insane film I’ve ever watched, it’s both a comedy and a thriller, drama and political horror-tragedy. And it does it perfectly.|, This trailer has so many spoilers that can only be noticed after you watch the movie.

this is without a doubt the best trailer I've ever seen and one of the best movies made|, This movie is a masterpiece. By far the best movie to win best picture in the last decade. The staircase metaphor to represent the position of different classes is just amazing|, I would do anything to watch this movie for the first time again"

Priest has always been a great live band!|, The synchronized dancing and playing guitar from both guys is INSANE even for an ""easier song"". And then when Rob joins in with the two and ian is goin back there wow. Wish I had a time machine.|, Just like Maiden’s synth era, Turbo is underrated purely for the use of synths. To me it adds an 80’s atmosphere that ages better than some of the other crap to come out of that decade.|, Fuel For Life was the first time I saw Judas Priest in concert so Turbo has a place in my heart forever.|, I've been to about a dozen concerts by different bands over the last 3 decades and Priest's music and energy stand out! They're (they REMAIN) the best!|, They are metal gods always and forever|, Judas at their prime were the best metal band ever. 🤘|, Cool song 😎|, Parental guidance and locked in are excellent stadium metal songs, stadium metal is metal with commercial sound, I love this version, it sound much better live here, I always enjoy watching the Priest’s live shows|, This is awesome!!

My dream is to spend  an lengthy period there !|, i thoroughly love this movie. The pacing is also thought out. I especially like how Jack is knowledgable about everything, very smooth talker, and just relax. Not gonna lie, I fell in love for him HAHAAH!! I was like ""Dang, Diane got lucky""

There's just something about Jack. Yes, some people may think he may be a player, but something about his confidence in everything was just spot on. And man, Diane is a MILF. Great acting, great writing, great location, great soundtrack, great cinematography, great photos from Dian's camera, great fun facts from Jack...it was so good. He's right,  Paris can wait.|, I am a very cynical movie buff.... but I have to admit this film got right under my skin.

Of course I was going to check it out, because these are the comic book adaptations that no one ever talks about.|, This is classic Audiard. Has you thinking about it long after watching. The soundtrack is extremely compelling.|, Looks like a pretty good movie to me! I have to see this movie!|, I loved it!|, Wow this movie made me feel boring lol.  Visually stunning. I felt Tomine’s influence in the breezy disconnectedness of the characters.

But I don’t feel anything strongly about this movie except that it was pretty.  The actors were good but the story felt very distant and unreal|, To anyone who’s seen it - what’s the last song that plays at the end right as the credits start rolling??|, Good French film"

Let's hope she continues running once she finishes College and faces Open Grade competition. Cheers|, Wow, absolutely amazing performance, well done Parker! 👏|, Its amazing to me how you can put out two such high quality videos in one day -- don't think your dedication goes unnoticed! (earned yourself a brand new sub)|, Parker Valby is an absolute beast!|, Valby is something else.  Her natural talent plus her race conditioning is off the charts.|, Glad I saw this live, this is the season for Parker Valby for sure, I knew she would break 15 but I thought it would be 14:58 high but dang 14:56 is crazy !!!|, I freakin' love ""I'm not just going to break the record, I'm going to squash it!"" attitude! There's been lots of buzz with Katelyn Tuohy and so I haven't seen much of Parker Valby until earlier this year. The only thing that made me doubt her is that slightly funky running style. Katelyn is the epitome of running form and mechanics. But the more I see Parker run, the more I see that strong inner-determination. And that's what determines 1 and 2nd place.

Well done Parker. Well done.|, Congrats Valby! You're a monster."

Definitely worth watching. 8/10 stars|, The ending just left us hanging but this movie has got to be one of the best imo. There's not too little or too much Romance, perfect happy and sad moments. It's been so long since I got to experience such a work of art.|, I‘m an absolute sci-fi fan and also love romantic story telling. I was not bored once in the entire 2 hours.

Unique concepts! Stop the cliches|, I was being prejudice towards this film as I was believe to think that it was about boring romance and all but no I was definitely wrong. I gave this film a chance and watched it. It was amazing, the characters development, their emotions portrayed in each characters, the dialogues, magnificent visuals and not forget Jennifer Lawrence was fantastically beautiful in this film!|, I know it's been 3 years since this movie came out, but I watch this on TV every time it comes on. Hands down this movie is a 10/10 to me. Very awesome movie still in 2019😆😆❤|, Still one of my favorites. This movie was ahead of it's time from the audio and music direction but also all the story elements. Everything just feels so tangible and my favorite part is there's no sci-fi logic going on.

Paterson,Paterson Official Trailer 1 (2016) - Adam Driver Movie,m8pGJBgiiDU,4134977,18645,923,"Adam finally living up to his last name|, _Beauty is often found in the smallest details._

I'm feel content knowing that there are still individuals like Jarmusch who contribute to the Arts in such an exquisite way; individuals who honour politeness, elegance, subtlety, style. 

Thank you, Jim Jarmusch.|, So I watched this movie with my parents, and they didn’t care much for it. They said it was boring and far too slow. However, surprisingly, that was my favorite element. It was relaxing, and it made you slow down and look at every detail. It takes you on every moment Paterson goes through in his day. And the repetition acts like a “spot the difference” picture puzzle, which makes the differences not only obvious to you, but you through the eyes of Paterson. 
He is content. He loves his life. His wife is eccentric and tries something new every day. Paterson is simple. They harmonize well.

Maybe it’s mostly cause it’s Adam Driver, and I love the idea of domestic life Adam Driver. But also, I stick by what I said. The slowness is one of the best parts. It’s not for everyone, but if you feel as if you need a break from everything trying so hard at once to get your attention every day, I would say give this movie a try.|, I absolutely loved this movie- The plot is a bit slow at times but the realness and lack of predictability and other elements make it a great watch.  Real people living in a real pace where things get rusty and weeds overgrow in yards and sidewalks - people with real jobs -Compared to the big budget movies where everything and everybody is perfect and the good guy wins|, In an uncertain way, this is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen throughout the course of my entire life (and I am a cinephile). This film can always cheer me up and help to appreciate the beauty of everyday life, especially in the world where we chase everything and live in a hurry. For me it works like some kind of meditation... it makes my mind zen. No words in english vocabulary can replicate spectrum of feelings I had during my first time watching this piece of art. It was so poetic and heartwarming... and it still is, because ""Paterson"" is so rewatchable. Besides that, it is a wonderful inspiration for all artists around the globe to persist creating and expressing themselves, no matter if they want to share it with the rest of the world or not. Jim Jarmusch, thank you <3|, Can I just highlight the relationship between him and his wife?? Thats what all marriage should be, both of them were so loving and supportive to each other, the wife with his poems and he was supportive of all the crazy things she came up with, their relationship was my favorite part of the movie|, First time I saw this film I thought, ""Oh, geeze, what has somebody done now.""   But it stayed with me, somehow, and I ended up re-watching months later.  Fell in love with this film.  The movie itself is a poem.  Lovely lovely lovely.|, This is a movie most people could call boring but to me it was so beautiful ❤️ I've watched tons of movies, since I used to be a big cinema fan, and this one has still stayed somewhere in my heart ❤️|, this film is so beautiful honestly, the poems, the melancholy music, the dialogues and especially Marvin the English bulldog!
Its like a beautiful dream|, A quiet gentle movie about routine, rhythm and domesticity. Also about poetry and the creative urge which is tempered by the need to work to make a living. Differences between a couple are explored- his woman's spending whims (the guitar purchase etc), but they compromise and her cupcake making scheme actually made a profit. The youngsters would say it contains a lot of contact with ""randoms"", eg the young girl who also likes poetry and writes poems. I like the way the film provokes viewer anticipation and expectations the way it does: eg when he sat down with that girl and talked to her a lot of viewers would have been alarmed at an adult male engaging with a female minor, but it was normal and it showed a meeting of minds. I like a film with this kind of realism. Go see Manchester by the Sea too, it also highlights a real place in America on the east coast."

Being born and raised in MA, the bombings and every footage or mention of it, just will always get me bawling. When it's ur home town or state, it just hits different.|, The opening of this movie perfectly shows the victims’, officers’, mayor’s, and the bombers’ lives before the bombings to understand who they are. This is the first big disaster movie I’ve seen of this kind, and it is done so well telling everyone’s story that we didn’t know about during this tragedy.|, That opening is great; ""she hit me with a smoothie"". 
It establishes a normal night of police work, and the crazy sounding people they deal with that can make them laugh, then later drives us head first into a world where truly crazy people can make us all cry.|, That poor MIT officer died as a hero. He didn’t let them get his gun. A true patriot. RIP to all the victims of this senseless terroristic attack.|, This was one of the best realistic movies of these past decades. The sound design is the definition of absolute suspense n terror. Props to the directors and may those who died on this tragic day be remembered|, This film was so accurately recreated that I forgot it was a reenactment at times. Props to Alex Wolff as well for playing a role like that.|, It's just so gut wrenching watching this . I cry every time I see the officer stand with the kid he did not for one second lay alone on the sidewalk.|, 10th Anniversary. Such a tragic event! God rest and bless all those impacted ❤|, Literally one of the best movies of 2016 we love it so much besides it’s hard to believe it’s been 10 years since the Boston bombing and I went to Boston later that year to honor all those good people who died"

It's one of those bad movies that is somehow really enjoyable. |, Shows that the film industry is going really strong when Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 is being released|, ATTENTION: Blart is back. REPEAT: Blart is back. #BlartRidesAgain|, Friggin loved the first one,can't wait to see how they follow up.|, Apparently Paul Blart: Mall Cop was so good, it needed a sequel.... |, I just watched this last night , and when it first came out .

This movie definitely gives you a visual presentation how firm Paul was with his faith.

I 100% recommend this movie. Watch and spread the gospel. Do not be afraid. God is with us!|, This was hands down the best Biblical movie I've ever seen.  Can't be beat in terms of showing how life was in the first century in Rome.  So refreshing to see a movie made to show how it really was and what it means to be a believer in persecution and putting faith in He who really matters, not being afraid of temporary suffering.|, For all those believers in Christ, this was a tear jerkier for me. Even though the movie was rated as good, the part of Paul touched my soul. It is amazing how knowing the Word and  the presence of the Spirit can touch our being by just imagining the suffering that Paul bared in the name of Christ. Last part of the movie did it... I could not hold my tears as I watched a man that I believe truly loved the LORD.|, I was a exmuslim and I saw Jesus, he is real more than anything, he is my Lord, my God, he is my Love, my Savior!!! I love him more than anything and I love all of my sisters and brothers forever, we all going to be with the Lord in Heaven forever.

The scenes feel very real, have depth and you can really feel God’s presence in all the scenes, in the actors words, what they speak and what the characters do. It’s the best Christian movie I’ve seen since The Passion of the Christ! ❤️|, My regret is not watching this masterpiece in theatre. The movie is just beautiful, when Paul says that he had faught the good fight I cried. Movie is powerful and perfect.|, This movie was powerful and life changing. I watched it this past Sunday. Every Christian needs to watch it. EVERY CHRISTIAN|, where sin abounds, Grace abounds more. 😭😭😭 That line hit me."

He's an underrated actor|, For those who don't think Tobey Maguire can play darker and more serious roles, watch Brothers. That is possibly one of the greatest lead actor performances I've ever seen, and it got him a Golden Globe Nomination. He will definitely be capable of rocking this boat.|, This was the most underrated and underappreciated movie of the year. A great, great film that went totally unnoticed.|, Tobey is one of those great actors that don't do 2 or 3 movies a year. He does a movie every couple of years, and whenever he does, it's always good and interesting and awesome. Much respect to ya, Spidey|, Yes! Spiderman 4! so glad I waited so long!|, Am I the only one who thinks tobey doesn't age?|, We miss you Spiderman.|, To hell with Hollywood movie studios...Maguire deserved the Oscar for this performance and he can act brilliantly in any different role. Hurray for Tobey Maguire!  I am an expert USCF retired chess player.|, I'm quite excited for this film. I hope Tobey Maguire receives attention from the academy for his portrayal, but probably won't because of the film's marketing. Tobey has a good chance for receiving a Golden Globe Nomination for Motion Picture Actor- Drama, though. I think in terms of the Academy, a screenplay Nomination for Steven Knight is probable, but we must wait and see.|, ""It's almost like I hear their thoughts.""

The team is absolutely amazing, and I am so excited for the world to see all their incredible work 🐶🐱|, I had a great chance to work on this project in the art department in 2020. So happy that this movie is finally coming out to the theatre! 🙌|, Hearing Sam L. Jackson fake-swearing is just so hilarious.

The movie looks like it's going to be a blast, too.|, After waiting for many years, tickets were bought for every showtime on opening weekend. The scene where Hank tells Jimbo ""It's hankin' time"" was quite uplifting to hear and evoked many tears of joy.|, The character designs look outdated, but the humor and overall look of this film is really appealing. It feels like it's combining old school comedy editing and Tarantino styles together. Hope it does well|, You know Samuel L. Jackson's having the time of his life voicing this samurai character if you've seen Afro Samurai.
Can't wait to see this in theatres.|, Hearing George Takei say ""Oh my~"" after all of these years gives me goosebumps|, I love the way they animated this movie, they even think about how to make the character has the look of its voice actor|, This should be a series ..love it already"

https://youtube.com/@PEARLDAILYCLIPS?si=9BsQem-lu2Mu9IQA|, Having no attraction for your spouse is indeed a difficulty, but that needs to be figured out BEFORE YOU GET MARRIED and start a family!

The main beneficiaries of a marriage IS THE CHILDREN. People these days are so selfish - they dont give a f*** if they ruin a dozen lives, so long as they get what they want for themselves. Divorce used to be seen as a shameful thing. Why it even became acceptable is another result of the glorious womens movement that's created this putrescent culture we're currently drowning in.|, My wife used to throw ‘you want me to pack my bags and leave?’ 100s of times constantly escalating over the smallest crap. As soon as she thought she was losing the argument, she’d come right out with it, trying to use it to shut me up so she could keep going. One day she argued with me over a disagreement and threw that out again. I got tired of hearing it, I called be bluff and said ‘say that one more time and I’ll help you pack’. Never heard it again.|, Notice how every time it's what they, the women, have lost or are losing. Not the pain they caused the husband, children, extended family; the ripple effect of damage that will never go away. Totally damned selfish. That's how women get themselves into dire straights, pure greed and selfishness. I have absolutely no sympathy for them. They have reaped the whirlwind, it's funny as hell, and oh so deserved.|, I was married for 26 years and had three children.  I went to extreme measures trying to please my ungrateful wife.  I was a great husband, but she had multiple extramarital affairs.  She ruined our family life and our finances (one of her boyfriends was a gambling addict whom she supported).  She would often yell at me: “You need to change!  You don’t make me happy!  It’s all your fault!”  Total insanity.|, ""A woman thinks she can derive her happiness from a man""
That's exactly what my ex-wife said to me: ""You're responsible for my happiness.""
But it NEVER crossed her mind that if I was responsible for HER happiness that she might be responsible for MY happiness (not that I believe that kind of nonsense). It never crossed her mind that she might have ANY responsibility.|, It's the child support and alimony laws added to this current culture of accepting bad behavior.  If a woman have to leave with only her money and what she brought into the marriage and 50/50 custody then divorce rates will automatically go down.|, I've watched what happened to my grandson.  I have never seen a better father.  I have never seen a better husband.   He is hard working, makes good, money, and faithful. He literally held her up for 7 years.  He learned that she had been cheating on him for a year....Maybe from the beginning.  What is wrong with women today?  OH!  I think she knows she screwed up,  but someone that defective can never be trusted again.|, As a man who checked out 10 years ago and was fine with it until I met someone else and am still with her. Nonetheless, if this doesn’t work I’m done. Women are a bag of cats by percentage.|, I had a family member who decided she didn't want to be married, so she left her husband and three kids to strike out on her own. She moved to California and attempted to live the dream. She found a ""chad"" who constantly cheated on her, refused to marry her, and refused to work for a living. She became the provider for a time. She was trying to live ""the dream."" Roughly five years later, she went from being a Christian wife and mother of three to overdosing on illegal pain meds that were spiked with fentanyl. That is what ""the dream"" gets you."

She was the whole movie. I don't know what to admire most about Kristen...her beauty...her sexuality...or her talent. All three are equally sensational.|, Just saw the movie and I did feel her loneliness; appreciated the cliffhanger scenes when it fades to black because you know those days when you lose track of time and you feel like the time flies fast and  you only recall few things you did in a certain day..I get it. I love how the director made it like that. It reminds me of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Ligeia""|, Very good film. You get two very different conflicts.

The costumes created for this film were amazing. And PTA direction was masterful. I think an Oscar may be on the cards|, I thought this film was going to be boring and pretentious but I was gladly surprised on how deep and beautiful of a character study this was. The relationships were poetic, tragic and relatable. My only regret was getting removed from the theatre for touching myself inappropriately during the third act.|, This is a movie you have to watch a few times to really feel it.  It’s astounding.|, As a fashion student i've always feel excited whenever there's a movie involving couture or fashion atelier. It's such a rare plot these days because the masses are used to blockbuster movies that they are not enjoying masterpieces such as this|, I just saw this film on Netflix. I totally fell in love with the cinematography and production design. Really captured the right mood and setting of the story.

 I'm not too familiar with Daniel Day-Lewis' films, but he was phenomenal in this film. I did not see an actor portraying a role. He became the character. I was mesmerized by his talent.|, I was so incredibly surprised by how much I loved this film, it's an absolute masterclass in gorgeous and seductive filmmaking. Also the score is bloody beautiful, I was swooning in the theatre|, Genuinely one of the most beautiful trailers that perfectly matches a beautiful, if not unsettling, film. I haven't seen it in a long time, and am looking forward to my next rewatch! In the meantime, I constantly listen to its equally beautiful soundtrack.|, This movie deserves much much much more appreciation because this is truly one of my best movies ever seen. Extremely well acted, and unparalleled.|, My goodness, Daniel Day-Lewis almost deserves an Oscar for this trailer alone.  At 0:39 he looks at her as if she is his own creation, like one of his dresses. He is complimenting himself for having found and created such a masterpiece more than he is genuinely complimenting her on her beauty. 

At 1:07 he laughs at the question ""why are you not married?"". You can see the pain from which the laugh stems. The pain of having never found the true love he has so deeply desired for decades. 

Daniel Day-Lewis is a master story teller, his nuance and depth is unparalleled. I can't wait to see this movie and the rest of his performance!|, a true masterpiece that gets better with every single watch, from the immaculate frames and aesthetic shots to the atmospheric yet captivating storyline and the performances of the actors...if this Daniel Day-Lewis last performance as an actor, wow, what a way to end the career, so powerful! blown away"

Why can't Hollywood churn out more intelligently written and acted films like this?|, Another subtle, magnificent performance as the mother searching for any information about the son she gave up as a child. Her perseverance and undying love will move you. To know his life, and to find out what he was like. A pretty amazing story. A beautiful performance.|, In actual life Anthony wanted to find his mother and returned to the convent several times, but they'd never tell him her whereabouts. They told him she abandoned him. And by the time Philomena tracked him down it was too late.... that is so incredibly sad it breaks my heart.|, Such a heartfelt film. One of Judi Dench's finest performances.|, ""I'd like to know if Anthony ever thought of me ... because I've thought of him every day."" That's precisely when my heart breaks every time.|, This was such a beautiful film, I absolutely loved it. The trailer tries to make this seem like a comedy, and while there were some funny parts, do not let this trailer fool you. There's a lot that this trailer is not showing you (which is a good thing since they tend to give everything away usually), it's actually a much darker film. I still loved it though and I can't help but feel so terrible to all the poor mothers out there still trying to find their children.  |, It is hard to wrap your mind around the kind of prejudice that unwed pregnant girls were subjected to. I grew up with the threat that I would be sent to a catholic home for unwed girls in Chicago and would give up the baby if I was ever to get pregnant. It was truly looked upon as a sin worse than murder. Finally, a movie that shows the agony that some women live with when they are forced to give up a child. Another shameful period in history.|, As an adoptee from the Baby Scoop era, this ripped my heart out. Finally, an honest portrayal of the tragedy and primal wound inflicted by closed & forced adoptions. On both mother & child. Truly evil.|, I just finished reading the book. It's SO beautifully written (feels like a novel, but it's history/biography -- the majority of the pages are about the life of her son, with the early chapters focused on Philomena and her tone in the convent). The subject matter is, of course, difficult and heartbreaking. I'll need to watch the film now...|, A perfect film to be shown on Mothers’ Day. Its totally filled with the wonderful warmth of a mother’s heart.💐"
Phoenix Forgotten,Phoenix Forgotten Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Matt Biedel Movie,yJW1m1UgJjY,1814987,11985,1815,"Just saw the movie and I have to say , I personally enjoyed the movie  it's based on true events so you aren't going to see any thing crazy really happen no gore or any of that . I've had 2 experiences myself and I think that unless you can sort of really enjoy the movie for the simple fact that the characters in the story pushes for the truth you probably won't enjoy this . If you've had a situation happen to you or you are a conspiracy theorist person than this is a movie for you👌🏽|, Okay so idk if im going crazy but as i was watching this trailer i swear i was being put in a trance. My heart started pounding, i got the chills, i was spacing out, my eyes were tearing. i couldn’t even finish the whole thing cause i thought i was having a freak out...|, almost the entire video had me locked in, then the end completely lost me. It went from mysterious to ""throw a bunch of fast jerky bright light shit"" at you way too fast.|, Let me guess...the movie ends with someone standing and staring at the corner...then the camera drops and it ends.|, I remember cruising over Arizona with my headlights on lmaoo|, I'm actually fine with seeing something like the blair witch with an extraterrestrial/extradimensional twist. Looks exciting. I'd pay theatre prices for this and I don't do that often.|, Everybody saying it's a Blair witch wannabe, I like it cause it does have some truth to it. All the stuff actually happened leading up until they went into the wilderness|, A good movie! Impressed me! This is a way found footage movies need to play. No over the top jumpscares. No paranoid camera turns for 'unexpected' jumpscares. Not very shakey. And very well paced. I'm happy this didn't turn out as a medicore horror movie.|, Looks awesome! Can't wait.|, I love this movie."

I like it for Disney to see, JOHNNY DEPP IS INNOCENT.|, Disney: You're fired

Johnny: When u fired me u forgot one very important thing mate ""I'm Captain Jack Sparrow|, Coming back to this so many years later. I wouldn't watch a new Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Johnny Depp, but I also don't think we need one. I loved the ending of this movie. Jack Sparrow sailed away as Captain of the Black Pearl, and Will and Elizabeth were finally reunited. It came full circle, and I don't need another installment. Five movies are enough for any series, in my opinion.|, Some legends can never be replaced 
Johnny depp is one of them|, People often compare Pirates to transformers, fast and furious, DCEU and other average franchises. But I ask which series has shown similar creativity? Mkst of the big franchises borrow material from books, comic books or toys,whereas Pirates has used just the name of a ride and created a whole new world out of it with charasmatic and fun characters. Captain Jack Sparrow is a cinematic icon unlike most other famous characters who come from other source material.
I challenge you to name a series that has so many interesting villians. The visuals of the series are among thr best in the world. Too many iconic one liners. Excellent action set pieces. And the music is bombastically brilliant. Bring on more Pirates! Drink up me hearties yo ho...|, Captain Barbossa is so underrated, to me he is as important as any other character in the franchise.|, I can't even imagine this film without Johnny Depp🤧|, I love this movie. It’s a damn shame y’all fired Depp. An innocent man. I mean come on, all of the actors he has worked with in these movies even backed up his innocence. If a man, who is kind and gentle, Javier Bardem even says Depp is innocent shouldn’t that say something? Bardem and Depp are like brothers.|, Johnny Depp is the heart of the series. Without him, it's nothing. Bring him back.|, I cannot imagine pirates of the caribbean without johnny depp, HE IS THE ONE & ONLY CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW. No one, literally no one could ever replace him."

I LOVE THAT PART|, It's 2023...still can't get over this masterpiece 😅|, Jessie’s reaction is what makes Becca’s part all the more endearing.... his gradual progression from “whaaat” to “oh no, you didn’t” to “God! I love this girl!” to “that’s my babe!” perfectly timed with the la la la!! Makes me smile every time!! 😍😍🤩🤩|, It's been 9 years and we still remember the first movie of Pitch Perfect|, Everytime Beca starts singing ""Dont You Forget About Me"" and Jesse looks up at her! Ughhh makes me wanna cry it's so beautiful|, Imagine if Jessie didn’t raise his hand, and she kept singing that part for hours.|, Can we just talk about how this movie had a whole plot line about tonsillitis so the all girl acapella group could have a bass? Genius 😂|, the way they transition from one music to another, one choreography to another, and the way the music is blended perfectly... Im forever thankful to Deke Sharon and Aakomon Jones because they also made this my favorite moment in my favorite movie ever"
Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2: Acapella Championship,ThwgavWbVCc,19002570,190753,2779,"The most chaotic yet the best generation of Barden Bellas.|, Imagine being one of the old generation of bellas, tired of work, tired of running the house, tired of the uneventful days then you get a phone call inviting you to perform on the stage one more time with your college friends and the present generation of the girl group you were once in. Seeing how successful these girls are and still looking back to where it all began, you feel proud to be one of them.|, The end of the song is amazing in its choreography. Slowly, without us first noticing, one generation after the other leaves the stage until its just the current one. And even they slowly start to fade as the light went out, with Becca and Chloe being in the spotlight as the last ones, until only Emily is left,being illuminated on the stage. Its as if they are saying that she is the flashlight that brightens the way for the new generation. And her being the only voice left after there was such a great chorus of voices emphasizes this even further.|, So is no one gonna mention how precious Benji is? Like he brought all them flashlights just for Emily|, Is it just me who gets emotional when they start singing flashlight? Especially when the old gen comes on stage? 😢|, It’s 2021, and I will still be obsessed with this in the next 10 years|, 5yrs have passed and I still have goosebumps when generations of bellas came up|, Flashlight having Becca in the middle at the beggining of Flash light and Emily at the center at the end shows the group being passed on.The shot at 3:42 with Aubrey at the middle back shows how the old Bella has ended and the new Bella has begun and her still being a foundation of the family even after 3 years of her graduation.|, I burst into tears when I saw Aubrey and the older generations of Barden Bellas appear on stage. This scene is the best scene of all seasons. I love Pitch Perfect so much and I can watch it over and over without getting bored. Hope that there will be a season 4.

Can we just appreciate for a moment how gorgeous the country music version of wake me up sounded. His vocals are great. But personally I still find A Capella more impressive because it’s more difficult than people think. Xx|, I love how the other 3 groups are having so much fun but the moment Anna starts, the others decide to really go hard because they sensed her as a threat so they combined all their power.|, I love the transition between Zombie and Wake Me Up, I don’t know why but I adore that bit|, My favorite part is when the soldiers hop in. They're not a group, the song doesn't match the category, but they don't care; they saw an opportunity and seized the hell out of it and it was awesome. 🙌🏾|, I got goosebumps when Beca start sing Human! I wish Bellas cover Human full.|, The country-voice guy looked so genuinely happy throughout the whole riff off xD|, I know it's a movie but the fact that they can sing in harmony and each girl knows their solos is pretty amazing if it was real|, That beatdrop when he started singing ""Grenade"" gave me life!!!!|, "" Bellas are doing what they do best quitting""  That may be but they certainly got the mood going. Everyone warmed up and sounded amazing with their help.  Imagine how awesome it would be if the entire ensemble sang together"

The music, the special effects, the jokes, it’s so good! I was astounded when I saw it in theaters|, Absolutely love when these two actors work on any movies 🍿 together|, How I wish Adam Sandler and Ryan Reynolds would be in a comedy movie someday hahahaha|, Adam Sandler wearing a short sleeve collard shirt and shorts in the oval office had me laughing so hard.|, Even when it's not his best Sandler gives solid delivery.|, Idc what people say about Adam and Kevin they are both legends and their movies still entertain me to this day 
Especially the ones where they both are together|, That fact that Freddie looks over to her like he’s saying “you heard him”|, As long as movies star Adam Sandler, they will always be watched and entertain the world."

The old point break just showed pics of Bodie rock climbing, snowboarding ect... but this one incorporates the working motion. . So im extremely excited to see how they tie this all together .. |, This movie actually expands on Bodhi’s ideas on the spiritual side of the adrenaline rush from the first one. I don’t get how people didn’t appreciate this movie because of that. They were faithful to the character of Bodhi in a awesome way and the action is better than the first no doubt.|, This seems like it is going to be a more crazy, more visually wild ride Hard to find good action movies and this one looks like it will be a good one… Great job drawing us in through the trailer!|, this movie is my adrenaline rush inspiration since watching it first when highschool,this movie always make me want to push my adrenaline limit every going outdoor adventure|, Anytime in my life that I've ever tried to suggest that Point Break was an amazing action movie I got laughed out of the building.  Now because there is a remake its all of a sudden being hailed as some sort of national treasure.

I for one loved the original and hope they can capture the magic again in this one.

Long live Johnny Utah!|, Enjoyed this movie a lot,stunts are AWESOME!! and i like the story will see it again just for the thrill of it,and to see another Aussie (from Home and Away) make it in the movie's a big.

Although if you can get past the similarities and just think of it as a different movie altogether it may very well be a good one. Ohh and the reason why there are so many dislikes may be because people disagree with making a re-make of the 1991 classic. Anyhow this movie still looks good.|, Few people understand what it's like to have a calling in your heart, and that is what this movie is about. It's about capturing what is needed of you so you can share it anonymously, when you do it for no audience, you do this behind the scenes and behind the curtains when no one is watching. No acclaim and zero applause . You do what you have to, for the ghosts. Save the world.|, As someone who hasn't seen the original. This movie was pretty cool, definitely left me on the edge of my seat :)"

Nelson Horror Movie HD",9eZgEKjYJqA,3349471,15038,1322,"What actually makes this movie so good is that you really care about the family. I think having Spielberg behind this is why that family element is so strong. The movie has a lot of soul, and a real terrifying theme of a little helpless child being taken from her mommy and daddy. There's parts of this movie where the acting is so great i actually believe JoBeth and Craig have lost their little girl. I still cry when she runs through Diane and Diane can smell her, and when Steven is trying to revive Carol Ann and Diane in the bath tub. When the teenage girl is freaking out and rocking back and forth because all this shit is happening, i mean that's very realistic and it works so well. Everything comes together to make this a classic; casting, script, cinematography etc.|, The end when Dominique Dunn screams while crying ‘what’s happening!’ when they’re at their wits end, being tormented to death by the devil... chills. This movie has changed many lives (and killed several also). I don’t think hell on earth gets much worse than this.|, Still to this day, this is by far the best horror-scary-thriller movie of all time. Wish more people could make a movie as good as this.|, I remember watching this movie when I was younger, it scared the crap out of me. It's still pretty fresh on my mind. It's a great film, not necessarily scary; but it definitely had creepy scenes.|, LOVE this movie!!!!!!  Watched it many times since I first saw it as a young kid back in the 80's and it never gets old. I wish Hollywood made movies like this again!|, Poltergeist in my opinion is one of the greatest horror films ever made, maybe not the best but in that list. Excellent film and will remain one of the greatest films in cinema history..... Horror films these days don't come close to the genius of Poltergeist.|, RIP Tobe Hooper! i saw this on HBO 31 years ago when i was 4 and thought it was scary as hell. Great movie! 1982 was an amazing year for movies.|, Really scary movie back when my childhood days were much simpler than today's seemingly more complicated lifestyle. More than 30 years later, it still consistently ranks among film critics' list of the scariest movies ever made. RIP Heather O'Rourke, Dominique Dunne and Zelda Rubinstein.|, I remember being traumatized by this film after watching it for the first time when I was a child... I was probably 6 or so, I was weeping and my father tried to calm me down by saying that not only it's a fantasy, it happened in America which is on the other side of the globe, it's far-far-far-away, they can't get you...|, Probably one of the scariest movies of all time.  I was 11 yrs old when this was released and I feel that it's one of Spielberg's top 5 movies.  R.I.P. Heather O'Rourke."

He makes me cry and wonder. He melts my heart with joy and love…☺️🙏🫶|, ENORME Papa Francisco. Um homem de Deus no meio do seu povo!|, A solitary figure who strives continuously to spread the message and heart of solidarity, of love, with love.

It also makes some pretty thoughtful statements about the modern music industry today. Totally worth seeing.|, If you’re familiar with The Lonely Island and what they do, I highly recommend this movie! Incredible!|, I LOVE the lonely island. How did I not know this movie existed until 2022 wtf|, I'm so unbelievably excited for this.|, I watched this at a prescreening and it was really funny. Way more laughs than I expected and I honestly never got bored from all the truthful puns they added, but I love Lonely Island so I knew I was going to watch this regardless. It's great!!! 😉 😍 😘|, I saw this tonight at an advance screening... it was great. I had never heard of it before but if the Lonely Island is doing something I am all in.|, Do people not understand that this movie is sarcastic? Lol|, I swear a year ago I was telling myself Andy Samberg needs to do a popstar/DJ movie.. and it came true! hahahaha|, This is such a funny, entertaining film. I do not know how it wound up in my Netflix queue, but I am so glad it did!|, so excited to watch this movie! this is like the most anticipated movie of the year!"
Portrait of a Lady on Fire,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire [Official Trailer] – In Theaters December 6, 2019",R-fQPTwma9o,4079656,29150,1282,"I really do not know what to do with myself after watching this film... it was just supposed to be another regular movie night in quarantine, but two hours pass in a heartbeat and I'm just sitting there in awe at what I just witnessed. Two days have passed since then and the film's grace is still forcing me to turn around and love it even more. There's something so mesmerizing about all the aspects of this love story that beauty does not even put it into words. 


I really want to fall in love now. Thank you Celine Sciamma and all the magnificent people who contributed to this project.|, It is strange that this movie has been experienced by other people; it feels like an artwork that only I witnessed. I’ve watched it six times, and I still cry when emotions are heightened and get a tight chest at the ending. Each time I notice a different detail. Each time I am at awe with the imagery; each scene is a portrait. I might even get a scene tattooed soon (It will be my first tattoo).  This movie made me understand the complexity of the relationship between art and man; the feminine energy, the gracefulness, the power in human delicacy. I will not say: “I wish I can experience this movie for the first time again”. Indeed, every single time I watch it, it feels like the first time. I usually mock people who write long youtube comments that no one will read, but I wanted to send this into the comment section just to make a link between me and other people who experienced the masterpiece that is this movie.|, This is honestly the most purest, deep, honest love of two woman who cannot be together but forever cherish the love they bare inside their heart. So amazed by this piece of work, I love this move and gonna watch multiple times Cuz it reminds me that's what love does.|, I love that theses women are treated like people before they're treated like lesbians. LGBT romance is so often treated like a spectacle, especially between women, so it's wonderful to see a movie like this where the female leads are never presented as anything but people.|, THE END WAS BEAUTIFUL, YET TRAGIC. Hearing an orchestra was something that Héloïse longed to hear. It was perhaps even something worth being married for. Now she finally gets to experience it - with the implication, like the painting, that she is now a married woman, whether it's to the Italian or someone else - but that brings its own complex set of emotions. In one sense, Héloïse has something that she wanted; she's happy. But hearing the music - specifically, this music - cannot help but call to mind the memory of what she lost in order to gain it; namely, Marianne. It's fitting that the piece itself is about a perfect summer's day being interrupted by a storm, though it'd also be fair to question which is which in Héloïse's case: is the invading memory of Marianne the storm, or is that the summer's day, being crushed by the reality of life without her?|, I found this film by chance .  I'm your average male whose not really into French period romantic films, but, after watching it I can honestly say that I've never been so affected emotionally by a film. 
 I can't stop thinking about the love and chemistry between the two characters.  Best film ever made and not a male character in sight, fantastic .....all men should watch this film|, As I watched this, I said to myself “It feels as if this whole movie is a love letter to Heloise.” Imagine my surprise and delight to find out that the director happened to be in a relationship with the actress who played her!!! Called it? One of the best movies I’ve seen in a long ass time. Brava!!!|, every single SCENE in the movie was pure art. a true FEAST FOR THE EYES|, The last scene tho.. It was painfully beautiful|, france not sending this to the oscars was a hate crime"

Love the overall style and realism showing nudity and death the way it would really be. Helped the movie feel based in a real world as the reality breaking stuff was taking place.|, Recently watched this film on a blind buy knowing nothing and am so glad I did. Great cinematography, acting, and something fresh. I can’t stop thinking about it. Hyped to see what Brandon Cronenburg has in store with Infinity Pool!|, I loved it. Definitely recommend it. It's a sci-fi crime thriller with elements of horror. Don't listen to the haters. See it for yourself.|, I LOVED this movie. Saw it at a P&I screening at Sundance... not gonna lie I was the only one applauding. Definitely not for everyone but at the same time there are always a lot of people being very loud in those theaters about how the movies make them feel... there was a lot of gasping and wincing going on. I think they had no idea what it was they were in for (which is funny bc they're literally press and industry screenings and those are the ones that usually harbor a lot of uppity ppl and retention)|, Awesome, thought provoking horror film, Brandon Cronenberg is a chip off the old block. Huge Nolan and Ghost in the Shell vibes, also gory AF but not gratituosly so. Must watch.|, The movie was as good as the trailer. One of the best movies of the year. Loved it!|, A movie about someone failing to kill Sean Bean, now that's original.|, I've already seen the movie but I'm still addicted to this trailer. It's one of the coolest I've ever seen. The movie is amazing too btw.|, favourite movie of the decade so far, going to be absolutely mind blowing when (and if) any movies tops this title for me. If you like black mirror with an even more horrific edge, this is the film for you. just watch it, i promise you, its a shame that how little money this movie made.|, I've a feeling Brandon Cronenberg will follow his father's footsteps and make some very good movies."

All the characters are still roaming in my mind even after years had passed after watching this movie. This is not just a movie its a masterpiece.💖|, I had memories of this movie and I wasn’t sure if it was a dream I’m so glad I found it|, I time travelled from the future just to tell YOU, the person reading this comment, that approximately 2 hours from now this becomes one of your favourite Sci-Fi/Time Travel movies of all time.|, This has to be one of the most underrated movies ever. Ethan Hawke is always making interest choices and movies.|, I like how Ethan Hawke plays a character who prevents crime before it takes place in Predestination, and then in Moon Knight plays a character who kills people before they commit crimes as well.|, Primeiros 50 minutos de filme eu não tava gostando, mas depois fica uma LOUCURA. Esse filme é um plot twist atrás de outro e são completamente imprevisíveis! Diferente de muitos filmes que a galera indica e vc já sabe o que vai acontecer. Achei top|, I have told so many people about this film, but most of all I enjoy watching folk watching this film and how I see their cogs working as various twists are understood in the development of the highly intricate story, and yet as far as I've been able to tell after several viewings, there are zero loose ends. Every thread in the story us picked up. 
You'll need to watch it at least twice to get all of the points. 
Perfection in story telling.|, This film won't be for everyone, but this is a great film that won't get the credit it deserves in today's world. It's incredibly profound and is now one of my favorite films in this genre.|, I like how the trailer itself is a paradox. Starting and Ending with the same question. This movie really is as brilliant as it gets. Time Travel concept at its finest. The movie is a good paradox as is the trailer.|, Un día como hoy, descubrí esta película con una trama llena de misterio y viajes en el tiempo que me permitieron llevar mi mente a otro nivel y definitivamente me gustaría compartirles sobre este film, invitarlos a que lo vean y que compartan su opinión justo aquí.

These kind of films are my favourite and are hard to come by decent ones and I would say this is one of my favourite films out !! I honestly hope they bring out another part of this ! The woman actor was amazing 😻|, Can't wait! A quality demon possession movie always brings a smile to my face.🙂🎃
 2022 has been a great year for horror at the cinema so far! 🤯🎃|, Watch this movie! Not only it has a different premise, but you can feel the heart they put in making this movie and the MC is so amazing! It also has some good jumpy moments and they make you care for their characters. You shouldn't look at its ratings but just give it a try. I loved it!|, Highly recommend. 9 out of 10 would be a 10 but there were a few things they could have added to make it even better story wise. If you pay attention I'm sure most will love it|, I think it will be quite interesting.  Especially knowing that actual nuns are not allowed to do some of these things in an Exorcism.|, I can’t get on board with a school of exorcisms that holds possessed people in its basement. It’s outrageous 😂|, It's so nice to FINALLY see a priest/nun that is actually the hero and not the villain! Like yeah, I get that there were evil priests/nuns in history, but that doesn't mean all of them are like that! It makes me mad when media focuses too much on the evil ones and not enough on the good ones.|, I've literally been waiting for this movie to come out since last year.

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Official Trailer #1 (2016) - Lily James Horror Movie HD,foGraEVNI0s,10783749,39770,3513,"Love this movie. I've watched it too many times without feeling bored because of its attraction and romance. Darcy and Elizabeth in this version are so great. I love their chemistry and the way they fight against zombies together as a couple. I'm obsessed  with them, especially Mr.Darcy. Sam Riley is really suitable for the character. And Lily James also done well.
This movie is always on my favorites list|, This film turned out way better than i expected it to. I love the original classic and the movie of course incorporated a lot of that into the movie. The zombie gave it a flare that I somewhat enjoyed. The huge twist on Wiccam was wonderful. Can't wait for the next one.|, Honestly, a Victorian era zombie movie is everything I needed and didnt know I wanted|, I just finished watching this movie, and I honestly love it. It would probably be better if I watched the original pride and prejudice, but honestly this movie was just great. 10/10.|, I absolutely love this movie I have seen it so many times, it never gets old. Perfect actors for the characters.|, Actually quite an enormously fun film! The sight of the Bennet sisters as a cohort of ninja zombie-slayers is worth the price of admission alone!|, Ok, at first i was like ""ah this looks dumb, haha"" but then the girls starting pulling out knives while still wearing their dresses and stuff and i was like ""Oh...OH! I am ALL for THAT!""|, My friend and I went to go see this movie yesterday as a joke, thinking that it wouldn't be very good but OH MY WORD, HOW WRONG WE WERE. This movie was SO GOOD. It wasn't anything that I expected and honestly, even if you don't think you'd like it I highly recommend that you go and see it because it really did deliver. I'm not a fan of the whole zombie fad but this movie was so much more than some cheesy zombie parody. My friend and I both left the theater pleasantly surprised and wanting to see it again ASAP! I hope enough people go out and see it so there can be a sequel!|, Love love looooove this movie! Seriously underrated. Will always be among my favourites! And the coincidental fact that I also train martial arts at the Shaolin Temple, AHHHH had me screaming like a fan girl!|, Omg I love this film ❤️ I have watched it at least 5 times I do hope they make another one and the actors are amazing so well done to them and hopefully they will make LOADS MORE ❤️❤️❤️"
Priscilla,Priscilla | Official Trailer HD | A24,DBWk6BohVXk,9955392,54366,4605,"For anyone curious, I believe this film is based on Priscilla's own memoir, and she approves of this movie. I'm sure at least a few people are wondering if this sort of biopic is still ethical, but this one at least is.|, The tone shift when he said ""what do you mean, you don't like it?"", when he wanted her to change her hair was absolute perfection. Sofia always makes such incredible films, especially centered around the female perspective. I cannot wait .|, This looks SO GOOD. The narrative decision to centre this on Priscilla's POV (I think it's based on her autobiography?) is a stroke of genius. I've never been much of an Elvis fan, but I'm finding myself genuinely excited to watch this one. I think in Coppola's hands the humanity of the characters (based on real people) will be far more nuanced & won't shy away from the darkness in the story. & these actors are absolutely nailing it from what I've seen.|, Saw the movie, it was so so so deeply meaningful to see this story being told with such a spotlight as someone who lived a similar experience at 14. We constantly hear stories and see headlines of these rock stars/adult men in music pursuing young teenage girls, and their stories are never told, their names never heard, their feelings never talked about. Thank you for making this.|, So glad Sofia Coppola is making this. I was scared when I heard a movie about Priscilla was being made that it would end up glamorizing Priscilla’s life|, Super ansiosa pela estreia! Pelo trailer já dá para ver que vem muitas emoções!!!|, Sofia Coppola movies are often focuses on female gaze, loneliness, girlhood, and womanhood which makes her absolutely perfect to tell this story. As a huge fan of her work, i can't wait to see this movie. Sofia rarely miss 🙌|, Damn!  We're actually going to go with the truth of how young the girl was, the massive power imbalance with him being an adult and a growing star and her being a kid of 14?  I am  down with that.|, Sofia really is a wonderful filmmaker. There's always an elegance to the way she tells a story. This looks incredible, and I say that as someone kind of tired of Priscilla.|, Super ansiosa pela estreia! Só pelo trailer já posso imaginar que será maravilhoso!!!"
Prisoners,"Prisoners Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal Movie HD",bpXfcTF6iVk,14104594,57746,5753,"I really love the title because it REALLY fits. Everyone in the movie was a prisoner. The girls were prisoners to their captors, Jake Gyllenhaal was a prisoner to the case, Paul Dano was a prisoner to Hugh Jackman, Hugh Jackman's wife was a prisoner to her emotions, and Hugh Jackman was a prisoner to himself.﻿|, Everyone's talking about Hugh Jackman, but I take my hat off to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. This movie is a master piece.|, This movie is criminally underrated. 10/10|, This movie is 7 years old and i just heard about it, and watched it. turned out to be one of the best movies ive seen.|, Really one of those movies you wish you could see for the first time again.|, One of my all time favorites. The scene where Gyllenhaal is driving Anna to the hospital is one of the best scenes I’ve ever seen in the history of cinema. A magical movie.|, Hugh Jackman is a beast in this movie. Amazing job portraying the role of a father of a missing little girl. He’s so believable. So intense. Does whatever needs to be done regardless of the law in order to get his daughter back. I would do the same exact thing which is why I love how far he is willing to go. Should’ve won an Oscar for his performance.|, This movie is a masterpiece. Criminally underrated and was absolutely robbed at the Oscars in 2013. Brilliant story, utterly fantastic performances from Jackman, Gyllenhaal and Dano, chilling score, and incredible cinematography/pacing/tone. The epitome of a perfect thriller.|, 8 Years Passed This Movie is Still a Masterpiece|, This is one of my all time favorite movies!  Definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat every single minute of the entire movie!  Worth watching again and again!!"
Profile,PROFILE - Official Trailer - In Theaters May 14,DKgW8UcGMNk,5858410,6450,747,"This is absolutely terrifying in so many ways. It gives me a whole lot more chills knowing that this happens in real life. If I happen to be in Amy’s pace, I probably wouldn’t have made it out alive in the end. Terrorism is something that continues to be widespread all around the globe.|, Finally saw the movie! 
It works as a cautionary tale and a dual character study; form really is content when it comes to interacting with someone 
It's good despite some leaps in logic and believability the performances by the main two video chatters is convincing 
It's terrifying how much we are willing to go for the truth as far as journalistic integrity is concerned|, The fact is that the film was shot back in 2017, and was shown at film festivals in 2018. At that time, Director Timur Bekmambetov actually invented this genre. All the famous screenlife films including Unfriended and Searching were produced by Timur Bekmambetov's company Basilevs.

Timur Bekmambetov then decided not to release the film and decided to focus on producing more spectator films. Apparently, because of the pandemic and the news about Islamic extremism in Europe (the recent execution of a teacher in France), he decided that his film has gained relevance.|, fuck, this movie is highly underrated. if anybody is reading this, stop reading other comments and simply watch it, it's a mind bending psychological thriller since the very first second of it. you have never seen anything like this. absolutely bone chilling and this will be stuck in my mind for ages.|, This movie was so good. And it gives me chills how it could happen to anyone. The internet is a major playground for dangerous people and fantasies|, Saw this back in 2018 at a festival and have been WAITING to be able to share it with others because it's my favourite of the ""Screen-life"" style movies I've seen.|, Amazing movie! Just saw it tonight. Cleverly done; the story was unfolded in screen messages and video conversations, with plenty of changes of scene on screen. The acting was superb. 

SPOILERS BELOW
______________________________________________________________________
You could see how the young journalist got almost totally reeled in, until she saw that she would not be his only wife. And it was terrifying how quickly he changed when he saw that she had been deceiving him, too. This works as a thriller on many levels, and even offers an insight into the mindset of the jihadists.|, Фильм обязателен к просмотру! Особенно для тех, кто одинок! Очень наглядно показывает, как на фоне любовной связи террорист пытается внушить необходимость  приехать и повиноваться!  Манипулирует чувствами девушки, т.к. она на фоне общения находит близкого по духу человека,  а это то, чего ей не хватает. Влюбляет в себя тем, что предлагает жизнь, свободную, независимую, иллюзию их совместной идеальной жизни (в подробностях). Обещает жить в большом шикарном доме, якобы будет много детей, типа будут жить долго и счастливо. Но по факту, все ведет к тому, чтобы она была очередной смертницей. Не хочу спойлерить, но настоятельно рекомендую особенно тем, кто столкнулся с подобной ситуацией, для начала, посмотреть фильм до конца.|, Looks epic, loved searching. Can't wait for this one as well.|, Between the five “Screen record” movies this is my favorite. And the fact that it’s based off of a true story is phenomenal. If you haven’t watched cause it looks like Unfriended I implore you to Atleast try it"

I was there when they were filming, wow I can't believe it. I can't wait to see this movie!|, 8 years later and my mind still thinking about how great thus movie was definitely seeing it again|, This movie was awesome. I saw it yesterday and really enjoyed it. Funny, good story-line and likable characters. Would recommend. :)|, Love this movie! My childhood for real! Underrated as hell|, After talking to future David (the teen) in the basement, his dad tells present David (the child) that his friend was at the house to fix something. We heard that dialogue at the beginning of the movie, which means that David was already destined to do exactly what he did in the film.|, Any movie involving time travel is always fascinating to me. But, sadly, at the end of the movie, anything make sense because not matter how many time you try to change the past, that particular event that make you change the past, needs to happen. That event is the one necessary reason that make you change the past. If this particular event doesn't happen, then you have no reason to go back in time. Time travel is always a paradox.|, this movie was iconic and will forever be one of my favorites.|, Damn i cant wait for this. It honestly looks good.

Promising Young Woman,PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD] - This Christmas,7i5kiFDunk8,9518285,58007,7436,"A film about rape without mentioning the word rape itself or any nude scene. I love it|, The aesthetic of this movie is so wicked, pastels and neons, bathed in a darker and horrifying truth, it’s absolutely amazing|, The scene with Dean Walker, that right there had my blood boiling. When it was time to talk about Nina, she couldn’t care less and swept it under the carpet, when she thought it was happening to her daughter, all hell broke loose. Amazing film. It’s just upsetting to know that it happens in real life.|, This happened to me when I had just turned 20. I dropped out of college, stepped off my career path, was scared to go outside or dress in anything other than t-shirt and jeans. It ruined my life for 12 years. After years of intense therapy, I’m now fully healed and creating the life I want for the first time in a decade and a half. No more fear or resentment, just a feeling of quiet power and desire to do good in this world.|, This film is sheer genius. What’s so great about Emerald Fennell is that she isn’t afraid to go to the places everyone else is afraid to go creatively. This is the greatest example of that, but you can see it so clearly in the episodes of Killing Eve that she wrote as well. She’s an incredible talent, I can’t wait to see the new projects she’s working on.|, The Margaret Atwood quote that will always stay with me: ""Men are afraid that women will laugh at them, women are afraid that men will kill them""|, I really loved this movie. It’s realistic in the most cruel/unfair ways.|, This movie is so much more deep and meaningful then it gets credit for. Every scene is perfectly thought out and placed. She is literally in a jesus, crucifixion pose throughout the film along with this whole ""promising young men"" complex and how flawed not only men but women are on this topic.|, The amount of people insulting her age/calling her crazy and letting the title fly right over their heads is hilarious. She was a promising young woman until she had to drop out. And this movie genre is a “thriller”|, Those who say this film portrays all men in negative light conveniently forgot the lawyer who was forgiven and ended up helping Cassie. Or the harmless father."

QT8: The First Eight,QT8 The First Eight | UK Trailer | 2019 | Quentin Tarantino,6j2kdRK1AR8,71582,523,33,"everybody goes to hollywood to be a star but if you are like tarantino you're not there to be a star...anyone can be a star...tarantino is a legend...|, Being a Video Rental Store Guy, having watched thousands of movies... I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that Quentin Tarantino is the BEST storyteller in all of show business and maybe the best director of the modern era. If you don't like his work, fine, but never ever for a second deny, that he changed Hollywood & Movies for all time to come!|, See everyone here is requesting something as his last film. Some are asking for kill bill sequel, some are asking for a move to connect to reservoir dogs to complete the journey. But I'm here to say let Quentin give us anything. Anything at all. Because that's what he's been doing all these years, all his films are connected yet separated, similar yet unique, like how every film has different atmosphere but you can still tell in 3 mins that this is a Quentin Tarantino movie. Doesn't matter if his last is a 3 hour horror movie or just a 30 mins short film. I will watch it as many  times as I can with the same love for Quentin and Cinema ❤❤|, Magnífico documental|, It's an amazing documentary and in depth look at the process of QT|, ""Who do you know right now that's dangerous?""

[Cut to Quentin immediately getting blown up]|, love QT so much i feel like i'm cheating on martin scorsese and i don't know either of them|, Wait, where's Quentin in his own documentary? I feel like the main piece of the puzzle is missing here. I hope it's just the trailer, Does he have more screentime in the actual movie?|, Amazing!|, 300th like and I love this man !! Please make another killbill !! So we can all die happy sir"
Queen & Slim,Queen &amp; Slim - Official Trailer,G6Th84oGDno,6468826,25862,3668,"“I want a guy that show me myself. I want him to love me so deeply I’m not afraid to show him how ugly I can be.” That strike a cord in the heart🥺🥺|, Years later and this movie still holds a special place in my heart. This movie is so profound. The meaning, the cinematography, everything. A literal masterpiece.|, I like how they used a 70s and 2010s feel at the same time|, This is honestly such a well crafted film, and the message looks behind it is striking and well deserving of a watch.|, Such a brilliant story I felt it was based on a specific true event. I enjoyed how it engaged me, the build up, the suspense, a climax and the tragic end. Well directed...|, Man, this movie fucked me up.  I'm a grown ass man and the tears were flowing at the end of this movie. Maybe it was because it has been just 2 weeks since George Floyd's murder.  It was a profound and touching story, not just about police brutality, but black love and black community unity.  The people are beautiful, the acting is natural and the story flows.  One of the best movie's that I have ever seen.|, Man this movie is so good I was crying puddles at the end because it’s about stuff that’s happening right now they really deserved to live🥺|, This movie was amazing. I can't believe I waited this long to see it, and I haven't heard anyone talk about it, but this was amazing. Beautiful and tragic and full of lessons. I will spread the word. Black love matters, black lives matter!|, ""I would've kissed all your scars""... I was bawling at this point|, Not many movies leave you with an urge to reflect, seldomly do you come across a movie that provokes your inner essence as a human being. Leaving you with a plethora of emotions, how you wished they made it across the big puddle of water, how you wished that their love would thrive, how you wish the little boy didn't shoot that police officer. Not many films leave you with a nostalgic feeling of an old school romance set in the present. The dichotomy of a Just Crime.

Queen & Slim manages to gather a cocophony of emotions into 2 hours, laughter, suspense, romance, justice, pain, a smile and at the end a few tears. A couple of individuals who's Tinder date sparked a revolution, most importantly leaving them as symbols of their time within Black history. With an Element of Bonnie and Clyde and 2 stolen cars, this isn't a story of 2 greedy individuals wreaking havoc across the country. It's about 2 people who's lives are brought together by social media but are intertwined by the circumstances that follow. A love letter to Black people, Lena Waithe describes this and it feels this way as the story of these 2 strangers who are brought even closer by their crime perpetrated by an unjust system, makes the audience understand and fall in love with the characters as we watch them fall inlove in the midst of the storm they have created. Nostalgic in it's approach yet so relevant to the times it was created. Absolutely beautiful.

As a life long chess player, I'm proud to be apart of this game that invites anyone with riches or rags to be a master, if you have the heart to go for it. She worked so hard, went from the slums to parts of the world that she'd never heard of and saw things she didn't know existed. Yet, despite the intimidation from it all, she became a champion and an important symbol for women chess players. She's certainly a queen. :)|, “Queen of Katwe“ is an inspirational true story that demonstrates how with family love, courage and a thirst for knowledge many of life’s obstacles can be overcome.

Glad to see Disney doing some different and refreshing in Hollywood.|, Loved this movie, most low or no income earning families in Africa can totally relate to this movie. The struggles people go through, I almost shed a tear okay I did it was so emotional especially their joy over small things we take for granted. Who agrees with me.|, Okay, now this is how you reach a global market. You tell the story of a young woman whose life is like the majority of the world. And yet, Grace gave her an astounding opportunity. Faith, Hope, and Love. Excellence.|, I'm proudly African (Nigerian) , and I have to say they're doing a great job. I won't lie, I sometimes find it insulting that every time someone does an African movie they tend to portray us as totally poverty stricken animals and leave out the beautiful parts of Africa. But I'm not going to be too blind to see what this movie was aimed at achieving and how there are actually a lot of stories like this (starting from the slums into success) in Africa. 
The The creator is Ugandan, the girl actor is Ugandan, the director has lived in Uganda for 27 years and it's a true story about a Ugandan girl; that's as original and real as it gets."

You can have the bad guy talk about/paint the most morbid/graphic picture ever, but as long as people get shot without blood splatters, were good!|, I loved these films.

Minus Freeman's death in the first one which felt underwhelming.

Such fun.|, To all the people saying he tried to give him one last chance but immediately started firing... I dont think he was actually giving him a chance. Right before he tell Frank it's his last chance he already made up his mind and told his men to kill him. His offer to Frank was just an attempt to trick him and have him lower his guard.|, Did he head butt a table, in half? That's both ridiculous and awesome.|, 1:45 It was at that moment, as Bob watched the boss shoot his best friend, that he realized maybe he wasn't being paid enough to be an enforcer for a blue-eyed nutbar.|, 1:22....OK, can we please talk about how AMAZINGLY blue this man's eyes are?

It's perfect.|, Hugo was such a great villain, you can tell that he was giving it his all and gave us a heartfelt ending|, I love that side of Rambo. In the previous movies we see a man who tries to keep the beast inside. And besides all the killing you still see him as a man or an accurate killing machine. But in this movie they do rip his heart.

I'm 33 now and still think it's hilarious.|, Once upon a time, I observed a neighbor kid do this to his dog. He would get the dog going then back away. This also made the dog start hunching the air as it walked. I was already crying from laughter and about to pee down my leg, when his mom busted out the front door screaming at him to stop. He works for the government now.|, Most underrated part is Stan saying “SCREAM FOR ME BITCH” 😂😂😂|, The best part was when Stan's mom tells the kids to stop, and Stan's dad just says, ""Just don't do it when your mom's around"" without actually caring about the words that came out of his mouth."

The actors really brought the story to live in the most beautiful way....|, I think this movie really covered the book better than I expected it too.  It didn’t pull any punches, and yet it wasn’t trashy or gratuitous in the sexual scenes.  It conveyed the seriousness of the subject matter without adding further shame and judgement than was already there in the moment.  I hope this movie causes people to read the book for the first time or reread it to get the full message of God’s redeeming love for all of us.|, Such a beautiful movie. Sometimes the main characters' decisions could be difficult to understand, but their stories caused them to make these kinds of decisions. I don't regret any minute spent on watching this movie. It was also great performances by the actors that created a masterpiece worth watching. Now it's time to read a book|, I finished watching the movie and it was really really beautiful I cried like a baby😭 it was just amazing every scene was done perfectly also the chemistry between the  act  was just wow this movie is just a masterpiece I felt love I felt pain everything they just moved every emotion inside me every one deserves a second chance every one deserves to be happy ❤ what mater what happen we must forgive our self and god will gave us forgiveness I which one day I'll have my own happiness and to be happy and I'll find someone who really love me for who I'm ❤|, A story well told. They cast took us in a journey. The story is told so well. The hidden gems like confessing her love was beyond amazing.|, Just watched this movie and it's fantastic! 
If there were more husbands like  Michael the divorce rate would be zero!
I really love the film and I think we are all very lucky that we will be seeing a lot more of Abigail and Tom on the big screen they were perfect!|, The book is indescribably beautiful! I hope the film manages to convey all the emotion and the message that the book carries 😭♥️|, The most emotional movie I've ever watched. Trust me you need to watch this...|, Just watched it, I loved this movie! ❤ That didn't feel like 2 hours, more like 5 minutes, despite the bad things it was easy to watch because of how well made it is. I like Abbey Cowen a lot. I cried at the end of this movie, I love the happy ending ❤|, You know a movie these days is incredible when all the critics, who go by their own or society’s agenda, pan it & hate on it but the audience says it’s amazing. This movie is one of the best I’ve seen in a long time. Incredible. 

Can’t imagine how much better the book can be."
Regression,Regression - Honkai Impact 3rd Theme Song Performed by: Ayanga - Honkai Impact 3rd,VrcB9PJ22F0,5625775,68095,3286,"*Regression*

""Too much of the past for one to memorize""
*- 500+ years of life.*
""Too many words remained for one to read through the lines""
*- Too many good memories and past occurrence with regrets forever etched in him.*

""The ebb and flow of the crowd floods the world and paradise
Along the path of time""
*- From the moment Kallen was sentenced to death by the people's decision, the regression of humanity (and himself) over the course of Otto's lifespan.*

""Every night brings a dream but the day, relentlessly keeps me awake""
*- He is experiencing living hell day by day. Though there is still one meaningful goal and dream to cherish in life (Kallen).*
""All the rest will be torn up whenever a choice is made""
*- Has always been Otto's methodology. Sacrifice anything for the greater good. Summon Honkai beast to destroy everything in order to save Kallen. Sacrifice Cecilia (Sirin battle) & all other Valkyries. Sacrifice even the world (Kolosten arc).*
""Every living soul in the fray striving for their own safe place""
*- Everyone is fighting for what they believe in. Otto himself, Kiana, Durandal, etc..*
""Life is too long to end at a grave""
*- He understands that a sinner like him no longer deserves a memorial in the world. Too many sins cannot be undone. He has regressed to the point of no return. He even mentioned that he hopes everything would start anew when it is passed down to Theresa.*

""Just a drop of water suffices""
*- Merely trying to revive/save 1 girl over the course of 500 years of Humanity.*
""Encompassed and swallowed through space by the universe""
*- Toyed by fate like a clown no matter the timeline and method.*
""Back to the source
Gone are those years living for a reason
Here it comes the moment of the scene of lost and found""
*- Countless attempts to revive Kallen but barely any progress repeatedly through the course of his life eventhough fully devoting and dedicating his entire life for this purpose.*

""Personas played out on the stage
Will return to the self when there's a curtain call""
*- No matter how things played out, it'll eventually lead to the pre-determined Destiny you're born to traverse through & end with. Also a reference to Sixth Serenade and her fate.*

(Second Verse chorus - Lyrics reflective of the scenes in Full Version MV)
""Every night brings a dream but the day, relentlessly keeps me awake""
*- Currently fighting to death for the ""Dream"" after he witnessed the ""Miraculous"" Kiana K423.*
""All the rest will be torn up whenever a choice is made""
*- Choice is made. His life for Kallens'. His legacy would soon be over. A timeline sprouts anew on the other side (As per the scenes in the MV).*
""Everyone has their own desire leading to the ultimate""
*- He's now heading towards his ultimate goal. The climax of his life. One he has desired for 500 years. He also believes that the ""heroes"" (Kiana/Durandal) and everyone else would one day reach their ultimate goal as well (as seen from his farewell ghostly speech to them in-game).*
""Life is too long to end at a grave""
*- Scenes reflecting all the actions and sins of his past. He personally accepted that some of his actions are irredeemable and hopes his sins and ways of the past would be forgotten and cleansed by Theresa's goodwill and leadership eventually. Scene ends with Otto shutting his eyes post-reflection of sins, signifying acceptance of his lonesome ending.*

""Just a drop of water suffices""
*- Just wishes to spend just another moment with Kallen once more. Wishes to change the fate of Kallen Kaslana, even if it is just another distant timeline where he is no longer there.*
""Still I wish to embrace the world with my thoughts""
*- Otto Apocalypse, the ""Scientist"" that was understood and approved by Kallen. The recognition then led him to strive to become the greatest scientist to assist Kallen and eventually led humanity against Honkai. Over the course of time, the methods slowly regressed and starts to leave a bitter taste.*
""A eulogy""
*- Despite all the sins, no one can deny that Otto Apocalypse has left a legacy worthy of praise in several aspects. Without Otto, Humanity may not stand against Honkai as it is now. There would be no Kiana. Valkyries would not be as it is today.*
""Time to leave where I have stood so long""
*- 500+ years of legacy and humanity's progress.*
""Letting you go recover traces overlapped""
*- I leave the rest to you (to Theresa in present, and to Kallen in the new timeline).*

""Ends, then Begins"".
*- My story ends here. Your story starts here.*|, I find it poetic, how Otto's final moments were utilizing the full power of Judgment of Shamash, a tool he always hated with a passion because of the Kaslana oath to use it to sacrifice themselves, a fate destined for Kallen that he had always fought against with his every breath, and used it to save her and break that cycle of tragedy.|, He took Mei's words to heart.
""If saving you is a sin, then I will gladly become a sinner.""

For all the hate Otto was a very well written character.|, Regression = ❌
Depression = ✅|, Mihoyo wtf? Are you a music company or a game company? This is beautiful.|, Singer Ayunga
When Ayunga was 3 years old, his father died of a heart attack, leaving behind a tape recorder, which Ayunga listened to for 5 years, learning all of Tengger's songs. When Ayunga was seven years old, his mother left him because of stomach cancer. In desperation, relatives sent him to the local art school.
After the death of his parents, Ayunga's elder brother brought him up. For the sake of his musical dreams, Ayunga wanted to give up his stable job and go to Beijing, which was opposed by many people. Instead of reprimanding him, his stern older brother silently took out a loan of 500 yuan and slipped it into his hands. After coming to Beijing, Ayunga worked in a restaurant to earn tuition fees, and he remitted half of his monthly salary of 2,000 yuan to his brother, who kept the money for him. Later, his brother passed away due to illness.|, Otto literally lived long enough to become a villian, he no longer cares if the world is against him, he has an objective, and it is to give Kallen happiness even if he has to lose everything. If he can't be with Kallen, might as well atleast let her be the one to live. All for her.|, I love how the saying ""Fight for all that's beautiful in the world"" still applies to Otto's actions.

Because the only thing that was beautiful in the world in his eyes, was Kallen Kaslana.|, Losing him feels weird. Like it was what we wanted but still feels sad|, This one hit hard"

I’ll always *Remember* this absolute tune!|, Nice 😊😊😊|, Canta de mais!!!|, Good 😊😁|, her voice was meant for this kind of music.. and David Guetta, as always, keeps making great sounds.|, On repeat today.
Something about how she sings “It's only when I'm lying in bed on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone” always gives me chills. More musicians should use more of that cuz it really stimulates my serotonin ☺️💕
I think it’s just cuz it’s kind of a 90s thing and it gives me the nostalgia feels.|, Becky Hill is amazing. Her vocals make me feel it in my bones.|, What a great song"
Renfield,Renfield | Official Trailer,6LmO6rmDW08,47993884,79866,5872,"I love that Nicolas Cage always gives 100 percent. It doesn't matter if the script is gold or complete crap, he knows how to commit and give it his all.|, This is a trailer done right. It doesn’t give away the plot, doesn’t show you all the best parts and does what it’s suppose to do which is get you hyped for the film. I wish more trailers did this.|, Considering the amount of detail original to the book (spider-eating, Vampires having to be invited, etc) this looks like a really smart movie having the time of its life being as dumb-fun as possible and I am here for it.|, This movie deserves a sequel. Nicholas Cage never disappoints. Good or bad he can cast. What you want him to be, he will be.|, I went to a dracula ballet one time, which means no spoken dialogue or singing for those who have never been to a ballet. It's like interpretive dance. The Renfield in this ballet was quite literally the BEST depiction of the character I have ever seen. The guys was barrel rolling across the stage and just going wild. It's hard to explain the dance but it was so perfect. 

It's about time they gave this character a movie of their own, he is by far one of my favorite side characters in any movie. Dracula Dead and Loving It is one of my favorite movies depicting this character so I hope this one is decent. Not too sure how I feel about them giving him super powers though.|, I don’t care if it’s low budget or high budget. Cage always does a good job acting.    Can’t wait to see him on top again.|, What is crazy is he actually looks like he might unironically be a really good Dracula.|, I immediately liked how when he said 
“come on in” 
he freaked out because that counted as an invitation to come into the building.
Old school vampire lore.|, I love the framing of an abusive relationship support group SO MUCH that I want to go out and see this as probably the first movie I've seen in a theatre since the pandemic, despite full knowledge that I might annoy everybody by breaking out in hysterical laughter when Dracula does something spooky and all I can think about is him getting mauled by bees.|, After watching this movie,  I love Nicholas cage all over again...and I see him in a whole new way🧡"

I hope he has found true happiness again bc from the stories I've heard, Keanu is such a good human being. He deserves to have the love and happiness in the world.|, I liked it.  I love any story having to do with the soul,  afterlife or near death experience and mixing sci-fi with such things.  It's a huge interest of mine currently but i will say Keanu is good in very specific roles but he's no good at crying or being outwardly and loudly dramatic. He's very quiet soft spoken and chill.  Very chill.  That's just the way his characters are from matrix to John wick to the lake house. .. the only time i ever saw him be very loudly energetic and expressive was in Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.|, A great guy that does not take himself too seriously, humble and warm. The people of this planet should aspire to be like him!

The movie is nuts and thats why i like it.|, Enjoyed the movie, the storyline was engaging till the end. Who doesn’t love Keanu|, Keanu is the coolest man on the planet as far as I'm concerned.

I remember as if it was yesterday I watched this with my dad, scared. 😂
Time flies really fast.|, The first film is easily a classic. One of the greatest zombie scifi films ever made. It holds up everytime you watch it.  Perfect development and small set feel with direction that is rarely matched.  The rest of the films leave much to be desired for me. Because they dont feel the same. I dont think ive seen this film yet. Which is shocking.|, Mila jest świetna w każdym RE   . Brawo !!! i nie tylko|, Just watched the final chapter. I can't believe it's been FIFTEEN YEARS. RE was the second Milla J movie I ever watched. It's such a terrifying thriller yet I could never get enough.

Milla Jovovich is just badass! She needs to be in a Marvel/DC film!|, Amo esse filme 😍|, Just saw this movie last weekend and I'd like to say this movie focuses HEAVILY on Alice and her personal story and not so much with her bonding with survivors and fighting the zombies the entire movie. This approach was different but I liked that it wasn't the same thing every Resident Evil movie has been about so far since the first film.|, please don't let this be the last one, at least one more, they way it ended makes u think there's more to come, love all of them so please  make more"
Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City,RESIDENT EVIL: WELCOME TO RACCOON CITY - Official Trailer (HD),4q6UGCyHZCI,15424230,132665,24016,"Something tells me this is going to be one of those guilty pleasure movies where despite obvious shortcomings, we'll have just all the fun in the world watching this. I'm all for it.|, I love it when even the trailer/teaser has its own mini trailer at the beginning.|, I love how faithful it is to the original games’ material that they even managed to get the cheesy acting and 1990s VFX down!|, I’ll give this movie this… it got the scare factor right. Compared to the first Resident Evil movie, this one actually felt like a horror movie.|, I liked it. It was for people who played the games and read the books. I was never expecting a word for word translation. It's clear that the budget wasn't the biggest but I appreciate it for what it is. My biggest knock against it would be that they crammed a little bit too much in one movie.|, Say what you will about this movie's quality, but you have to give them credit for sticking to the source material like no other RE movie ever has. I also appreciate that the song they used for this trailer was released right around when the first RE was.|, Keep your expectations low, and you'll never be disappointed - Kratos|, So I always liked the Mila Jovovich versions, but this version was so much fun, because it is like getting to live the original games. You get to see so much of the original settings, names and story lines. The slow changes and creepy sayings, itchy scratchy. Loved it so much. I do hope they go on with more of these now.|, Say what you want about the film but the production value and overall feel of the city was done really well. Even without the zombies and shit it felt like a place I did not want to live in.|, Saw this movie last night and think this is a great movie. I know many people will find it to be a disappointment as it may be "" rushed "" because it has some parts of its story from the game missing. But I'm new to the resident evil games and grew watching Milla Jovovich's take on resident evil. 

So as a new comer of the resident evil universe, i thought the movie was great. Would highly recommend it to anyone else who is new to this universe as well. It's got everything you want. Especially the zombies which is what makes the movie so great for me."

I gotta speak it, believe it, that's how I feel inside

You can take my heart, you can take my breath
When you pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up

Hey can you hear me? Hey, are you listening?
Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history
Walk through the fire, walk on the water

Any era, any style, from the beginning of time.  If you doubt it then look up when she filled in for Pavoriti at the very last minute at the Grammy's.  She went on unrehearsed and sang with his orchestra, in his key in ITALIEN!!!!!!  Oh yea, Otis should given her a co-write on this song.  At least some of the publishing|, I hope she knows how much she moved this world with her voice! Was and always will be one of the biggest vocal inspirations ever. You shake them heaven clouds with your angel voice Aretha!|, Can't believe she's gone. She was like a mother and Queen of Soul. RIP Legend (1942-2018). She could have been 79 today.|, That powerful voice belts out like a trumpet from heaven it goes right through you and Tears start to fall and your heart starts to droop|, She has such a powerful voice, and will continue to make smiles forever.|, Just a friendly reminder that this was recorded before multi track and before digital. 
You are hearing one single take, one performance by one spectacular vocalist, and her fantastic ensemble."

Keep em coming.|, Even if Liam Neeson keeps starring in repetitive action roles involving his family or just repetitive plot, it just never gets old. The voice? Iconic. The face? Iconic. The threats?

Kirk, man good to see you still looking good! I wonder how much he deadlifts...|, This video is on Pure Flix Sept 2019|, GROSS.  Tempted to Boycott Fathom Events for giving Kirk Cameron a platform to spew hate and stupidity! Stick with Entertainment, not with a sick agenda!"
Richard Jewell,RICHARD JEWELL - Official Trailer [HD],gSMxBLlA8qY,12703062,33207,4231,"A story that needed to be told. 
An innocent man who’s only crime was trying to do the right thing and save lives. 
The media and law enforcement destroyed this man’s life. Few people remember his exoneration. All involved in his slander should be ashamed.|, RIP Richard Jewel. A true American hero.|, I know that Richard Jewell had health issues, but I still believe that he would have lived a lot longer had he been treated like the hero that he really was.|, Actually a really damn good film. Just the raw emotion, all the performances are phenomenal, it’s very easy to look over Paul Walter Hauser’s performance in this, he does so many little things and make such a big impact. Such a great movie|, I remember watching him on an interview later after he had won the court case and he was a broken man.  He had received compensation but nothing could return him to the person he was.  I despise the media for destroying this man’s life.|, An amazing film that highlights a hero unjustly accused. 10/10.

Also, on a minor note, the man who plays the officer at the 0:24 mark is actually my uncle (from my father's side), so it fills me with a small sense of pride to say I know somebody who starred in this movie.|, This is no joke, let’s give a huge credit to Clint for his big effort and for Richard, a national hero.|, This trailer gives me chills.|, This movie's release was oppressed in the media, one of the best movies I have seen in years, all because of how it shows that law enforcement is frequently blinded by agendas as well as how the media spins the truth in order to fulfill their own agendas.|, I’ve seen this movie three times now and whenever I tell some people I think this is my favorite movie of the year I get hit with the “But what about Endgame? What about Star Wars?” I mean those movies weren’t horrible, but this movie really hit you.  This was a real, innocent human being who didn’t deserve the things that happened to him.  The cast was amazing but Paul, oh Paul, this better get him the recognition he deserves because that man is a true class act."

Plus MERYL STREEP! |, NÃO CONSIGO PARAR DE ASSISTIR ESSE TRAILER!!! 😍😍😍|, Streep changes characters and genres more than I change my shoes and masters them all, nails the characters every time. So far I've never seen one bad performance by her. She and Springfield look hot together. It's good to see him back. He went through some really rough times, but managed to pull himself back up. Good on him! Kline is also always a complete joy to watch in anything. Diablo Cody (JUNO) wrote it, and Jonathan Demme is directing... I want to see it!|, ADOREI O FILME VEJO QUASE TODOS OS DIAS E AS MÚSICAS SÃO DEMAIS++++++++++|, ¡Este es un gran ejemplo! (-:

We need more Riddick movies|, I LOVE that split second between here riddck catches the blade and when he kicks it. That second of his eyes, there’s nothing but hate and contempt there. “You killed my dog….”|, I love how after he catches the blade on his foot he simply stares at him from the dark with those glowing eyes just like a predator staring at its prey. Awesome|, Algorithm be like: Guys, we must mute all cuss words, so it's safe for children, but that one scene with the head split in half, that can stay no problem.|, Great series, great cast, and Vin Diesel's best role imo. Doesn't get more badass than this..|, Riddick is a franchise, Vin at his best, him laughing after the first attack is amazing, that and his balls deep comment are worth every moment.|, If someone like Riddick tell that there is something worst then him on the planet and he wants to make a deal......take the damn deal|, I love how he uses his foot to check the balance of the machete before being able to use it to its full potential.|, I know it's not exactly 10 Years yet for this movie but I can't believe it's that long. the third film was awesome"

It's brilliant!  Not one cringe moment whatsoever. It's a must-see!|, So excited for this movie! Beautiful filming, amazing locations, excellent acting, riveting story, fascinating message. I don't want to have any expectations because expectations nearly always get disappointed, but boy, I can't help it after that trailer!|, I may be late to the party but finally saw this today this Easter and it's easily one of my favourite films of the genre.  Great performances, great cinematography, great many things!|, As a non-believer of Gods, I found this movie amazing to watch. The action scenes, the storyline, the drama. It's great.|, Love love this movie!! Its ok if you dont believe noone can force you. But the ones who do believe in God like myself, will always till our last breath love and believe in Him. It doesnt matter if the whole world is against us, at the end of the day you gotta follow your heart❤️|, Awesome film unique perspective and takes you on a journey you can easily track the events happening around them. Yes more Eastern faces would have been awesome among the main characters but Joseph Fiennes, Cliff Curtis and even Tom Felton did an awesome job.|, Just saw RISEN & like all religious movies I've seen, it always bring me to tears. This is another good movie.|, This film looks great! Classic story of how a person's faith and moral beliefs are tested and changed when they go seeking truth only to find a different understanding of what they never truly knew. I look forward to watching this.|, I saw RISEN when it was first released, and then again this Easter. It's still a powerful, extremely well-told version of a  well-known story.

Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain,ROADRUNNER: A Film About Anthony Bourdain - Official Trailer [HD] - In Theaters July 16,ihEEjwRlghQ,4228786,29504,2257,"I’m 51 . Blue collar. Mr Bourdain changed the way I thought about myself. I looked at him and said if this guy , a cook, an addict, a man that admittedly had huge faults as a person similar to mine can go to these wonderful places and meet and enjoy time spent with people from these places so can I. I guess he inspired me to do things in a way no one else ever did. And when I learned he cashed in his chips I’m not ashamed to say I teared up a bit as if I lost a close friend. And it’s amazing that he had this effect on so many people around the world.|, Right in the freaking soul!|, If you want proof that depression is mental illness, consider that this man was paid handsomely to go all over the world, see the most remarkable sights, experience once in a lifetime events, and eat the best food humanity has to offer. If he couldn’t be happy, happiness cannot be achieved through outside influence. It must be found within|, How do I genuinely miss someone I never met? His journeys and commentary truly make it feel like you're traveling with an old friend.|, It’s so nice to hear his voice, to hear him laugh, it’s like hearing an old friend.|, Saw it last night. First time in a theater in two years, also the most I've ever cried in a theater. This movie was everything I'd hoped for and more. Absolutely incredible, beautiful, hilarious and heartbreaking.|, It feels so weird to remember that we live in a world he’s no longer in, and yet for people who love him — he’s actually everywhere. Thank you for everything, Tony. You have done so much for me, even after you’ve passed. And I know that might not have been your intention for anyone, but it’s what happens when you witness another person living their truth — it sticks with you forever.|, What it all boiled down to was the age old heartbreak of a broken relationship that did him in. He traveled everywhere, had all the money he needed but he didn’t have love. That’ll tear you down every time.|, Why does everyone feel so deeply connected to this man? I think it’s bc there isn’t an inauthentic bone in his body, his honesty, vulnerability, always quick to remind people what’s truly important and passionately pursuing the things in life that made him happy. It feels like we knew him—warts and all. This is a well-deserved feature doc, and I suspect it’s going to have me in tears more than once.|, Un alma libre en busca de respuestas... Nos inspiró a muchos! Personalmente, he conocido el mundo a través de él y nos enseñó siempre a ver más allá. Su muerte aún me conmueve y no pude evitar soltar un par de lágrimas al ver el tráiler, será sin duda un gran homenaje! Gracias por tanto Anthony, has dejado una huella en el mundo!"
Robin Hood,"Robin Hood (2018 Movie) Official Trailer – Taron Egerton, Jamie Foxx, Jamie Dornan",zwPn9ZnbCo0,16909091,66834,5198,"Dude, I dunno wtf other people are talking about, this was a sick movie! I've heard of Robin Hood before, so I'm glad I finally got a chance to see him on the big screen. Awesome rapid-pace arrow firing sequences, incredible world-building and visual direction, hell, even crazy horse-chase scenes! A fun fantasy-action movie :)|, To be honest this mix of time periods actually is pretty nice imo bc it immerses you in a mixture of fantasy and reality. The mix of time periods gives you those fantasy world vibes but the mention of historical events/actual places ties it to reality and in a certain way it matches Robin Hood because he actually existed, he is a real person, but his story is surrounded by legends so much that in a certain way, he has become a myth. His story sounds so much like a legend that ppl often forget he really existed. So yeah the mix between fantasy and reality in the setting matches the character so I found it a pretty good move on the producers part.|, The fact that the actors were actually trained to do most of the archery scenes without special effects makes this movie 10x better|, I think the concept of an amalgamated timeframe in this movie serves to emphasise the fact that the legend of Robin Hood holds universal appeal and endurance. In other words, it essentially pays homage to his timeless legacy.|, I think this looks great, perhaps not as historically accurate as the others but I am personally excited to see this movie on the big screne. I love the characters and the basic story line as well as the casting. What I hope is that the female lead does some bad ass stuff as well...just a hope.|, I just saw it and found it very entertaining. Awesome costumes, a refreshed take on a well known story and that machine arrow shooter is just so sick! I’ll definitely remember this version of Robin Hood. 👍👍|, Really enjoyed this movie! One of Taron's best work, though I love him in Kingsman as well… A great action movie with a mix of romance, angst, and comedy! I'd love it more if the time setting stays true to the original story but it's fiction anyway so I don't really mind… 
I must say I'm glad I understand English quite well though, because the Indonesian translations was a mess, many mistranslated words and sentences translated into the wrong context…|, Taron Edgerton is a badass. Not only in Kingsman, but in a modern Robin Hood.|, This looks like amazing, stupid fun! Who cares if its silly, so long as we can enjoy seeing actors who are fun to watch do some fun action scenes.|, Everyone is arguing about the film but I’m just here for my love Taron😂❤️"

A fun fantasy-action movie :)|, To be honest this mix of time periods actually is pretty nice imo bc it immerses you in a mixture of fantasy and reality. The mix of time periods gives you those fantasy world vibes but the mention of historical events/actual places ties it to reality and in a certain way it matches Robin Hood because he actually existed, he is a real person, but his story is surrounded by legends so much that in a certain way, he has become a myth. His story sounds so much like a legend that ppl often forget he really existed. So yeah the mix between fantasy and reality in the setting matches the character so I found it a pretty good move on the producers part.|, The fact that the actors were actually trained to do most of the archery scenes without special effects makes this movie 10x better|, I think the concept of an amalgamated timeframe in this movie serves to emphasise the fact that the legend of Robin Hood holds universal appeal and endurance. In other words, it essentially pays homage to his timeless legacy.|, I think this looks great, perhaps not as historically accurate as the others but I am personally excited to see this movie on the big screne. I love the characters and the basic story line as well as the casting. What I hope is that the female lead does some bad ass stuff as well...just a hope.|, I just saw it and found it very entertaining. Awesome costumes, a refreshed take on a well known story and that machine arrow shooter is just so sick! I’ll definitely remember this version of Robin Hood. 👍👍|, Really enjoyed this movie! One of Taron's best work, though I love him in Kingsman as well… A great action movie with a mix of romance, angst, and comedy! I'd love it more if the time setting stays true to the original story but it's fiction anyway so I don't really mind… 
I must say I'm glad I understand English quite well though, because the Indonesian translations was a mess, many mistranslated words and sentences translated into the wrong context…|, Taron Edgerton is a badass. Not only in Kingsman, but in a modern Robin Hood.|, This looks like amazing, stupid fun! Who cares if its silly, so long as we can enjoy seeing actors who are fun to watch do some fun action scenes.|, Everyone is arguing about the film but I’m just here for my love Taron😂❤️"

I was a 20 year old girl when this song came out.  I used to watch it on MTV all the time.  Now, I'm a 61 year old retired woman.  I still love this song and it still makes me feel good when I listen to it.  You guys rock. 😊|, What a great song and video|, This song is a masterpiece.
This band is a legend!|, My dad showed me this song a few years before he passed. I was about 13 and loved it, I remember him dancing and singing along in the living room.|, It’s ridiculous how much a mood lifter this song is.|, 41 years and still a belter of a tune❤|, Great song, great music video, and an armadillo?

Rocketman,Elton John - Rocket Man (Official Music Video),DtVBCG6ThDk,142562576,1044114,27128,"One of Elton's best songs. The chorus is unreal.|, I've listened to Elton John since I was 12 years old and at 62 I still listen to it! He's a great musician!|, This song is often interpreted as a reflection on the loneliness and isolation that can come with a life of constant travel and fame, which are experiences Elton John himself was familiar with. The lyrics describe an astronaut's longing for home and the people he left behind. The phrase ""Rocket Man"" is a metaphor for someone who is detached from the world and feels like they are ""burning out his fuse up here alone."" The song conveys a sense of melancholy and the emotional toll of a life that's always on the move. ""Rocket Man"" has become one of Elton John's most iconic and enduring songs, known for its evocative and introspective lyrics.|, As a traveling wind technician, always on the road, working long hours, coming home for a few days, then hit the road again and be gone for a month just to provide a better life for my family, this song hits hard and gets me teary eyed|, While I got through my depression, i found this song and understood the loneliness it felt and felt comfort that I'm not the only lonely person|, No matter how many years pass, this song will stay in our hearts forever!❤❤|, Wow, in the early 70's this was considered just regular contemporary top-40 music. By today's standards, they sound like epic timeless classic compositions.|, *A message to the future generations: Don't let this beautiful masterpiece die!*|, I love the depth added by listening with headphones, despite this, this is one of the best songs ever|, Decades ago when I first heard this song I was totally captivated. It sounded incredibly unique and like nothing else out then. The lyrics always take me into outer space on a mental level even now. This is timeless. An amazing song!"

Even though it is fictional, I feel it really catches the realism of war on how easy it is for brave heroes with their own story to just become another number lost in history.|, This is the best Star Wars movie.
It has the plot of the originals. The action of the prequels. The visuals and edits of the sequels. It gives the characters meaning and makes them relate to the audience. It has humor. It makes sense. It’s Star Wars. It’s Just so good|, for me, Rogue One has the best air battle of all the Star Wars movies|, this movie portrays the war between the empire and the rebellion better than the original trilogy did|, This was the only new starwars movie where i could literally feel the fear and the hopelessness to bottom of my spine at the appearance of an antagonist. When Vader arrived in the rebel ship, his breath and then the sound of the red light saber and him killing all the helpless rebel soldiers! It was just amazing, they really were able to capture why Lord Vader was called LORD afterall and why was he so feared even among the most powerful of characters, including the EMPEROR HIMSELF.

This is one of the many things that i feel all other movies in the new trilogy failed to portray.|, ""This movie is good when is the sequel coming out?""
""1977""|, Call me crazy, but, this is my favorite Star Wars film.|, It's been 6 years and I still love this movie just as much as the first time that I've seen it.|, I wish I could go back in time to see this on the big screen all over again. Absolutely amazing film.|, Andor just made this movie 10x better"
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","ROMAN J. ISRAEL, ESQ. - Official Trailer (HD)",CItEtnp3nPY,3223169,7544,485,"The movie has such depth due to Mr Washington’s incredible talent. It depicts a legal savant who would likely have been diagnosed with a mental disability as many geniuses seem be on the verge of having breakdowns. It depicts how disconnected people are from their communities through work that isn’t rewarding but pays the bills. It’s about systemic oppression and poverty and racism and mass incarceration. It’s about caring and compassion and freedom and forgiveness. I agree with whoever said that the trailer doesn’t do justice to the film. I just saw it on the plane today.  See it!|, ""I'm tired of doing the impossible for the ungrateful.""  That's fucking beautiful.  This looks like a great movie.|, "" I'm tired of doing the impossible for the ungrateful"" Baby Lord I so understand that line!!|, I loved this movie! Denzel was super duper as per usual!!! what a story!! wow! for sure, five stars...expect every attorney, every law school student, every person with high-functioning autism and those who love them to enjoy this movie.  FIVE (5) STARS!|, The audio of this movie is AWESOME!  I was able to sit and watch, but I was able to work and listen.  Nearly every detail of the movie was conveyed in the spoken words of the characters!  This type of screen writing is rarely achieved.  Awesome!|, Só assisti o trailer até 30 segundos por que já ganhou meu coração|, I just saw Roman J Israel esq, last night it was a great movie, denzel definitely deserves the nominations he's been awarded. hopefully he actually wins because he dug really deep into that role.|, The real enemies aren't the ones on the outside, they're on the inside. I love this movie it is about Principle, integrity and beliefs. I hope future generation will watch this.|, This is one of my all time favorite movie trailers and I have no idea why. I like the title of this movie too. The movie itself is also good. Just a homerun of dope movie media, honestly."

Lyrics：SHIROSE
Music：SHIROSE, Stephan Elfgren, Caroline Gustavsson

When I was your boyfriend…

In the room too big for myself
with the things you have left
This song that we listened to together
I can’t listen to it now

Now I realized
that I was so young and naive
But it’s probably too late 
I’m so stupid

I came to the park I wanted to take you to
When I was your boyfriend
I watched the movie that I wanted to see with you
When I was your boyfriend
And my tears won’t stop

Words you said
I couldn’t understand
The reason that made you cry
It’s probably me

I kept something until yesterday
Thinking that I would give it to you
when you come back
But I’ll throw it out now

I came to the park I wanted to take you to
When I was your boyfriend
I played the song we used to listened to
When I was your boyfriend
And my tears won’t stop

I came to the park I wanted to take you to
When I was your boyfriend
I watched the movie that I wanted to see with you
When I was your boyfriend
And my tears won’t stop

Passed each other in the park I wanted to take you to
When I was your boyfriend
I played the song we used to listened to
When I was your boyfriend
And my tears won’t stop
And my tears won’t stop

Finally, a breath of fresh air.|, “I currently have one friend”
“That is sad and also tragic”
See, B-Bot is a true friend bc a true friends tells you the truth|, Saw this today. Turned out to actually be pretty good with surprisingly deep stuff not only about issues with social media but also toxic friendships. I admit I went in with low expectations.|, They really should start considering doing a sequel for big hero six.|, Its such a sad, happy and meaningfull movie, definitley my favorite. It sends the most accurate message ive ever seen on any movie. It reflets our reality, the good side, the bad and what needs to be done.|, I love how you can clearly tell the message of the whole movie by watching the trailer|, One of the best movies I've seen in years, way better than others out there.

I laughed a lot. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the plot, everything!!!|, I don't really get the hate. this looks pretty fun 🐸👌
Not all movies have to be amazing masterpieces you know 😑|, I just watched this movie and I enjoyed it.  Was it a great piece of cinema?  No, it wasn't, but comedies like this aren't supposed to be. Besides I am a huge fan of Kate McKinnon and can watch her in practically anything.  Jillian Bell is also hilarious.   I'll say this much: This movie is far funnier than Ghostbusters 2.|, It is surprisingly funny as hell.. loved it !|, Aghhh this looks so good. They prob didn’t even need to act for this movie beside just keep a straight face for some bits 😂|, This was surprisingly hilarious!|, I love this movie. 
just watch the movie and don't think or find something in it, then compare to other movie and tell who's better and not.|, Good to know she's not just an action star!|, I don't think there's problem in this movie its great"
Rudy,Rudy: Rudy&#39;s Winning Football Game (Sean Astin HD Clip),D4ZAyiEeocY,2994809,16490,2114,"Rudy is an inspiration to us all.  He found One-Eyed Willie's treasure, helped destroy The One Ring, and made the Notre Dame football team with nothing but determination and hard work.  What can't this man do?|, He also has the highest tackle percentage of any defensive player in college history! 100 percent!|, I saw this in the theater when it came out.   I was 18 yrs old.  I managed enough courage at the time when everyone started chanting ""Rudy Rudy"" to grab my date's hand and hold it throughout the movie.  We're still married, nearly 30 yrs later.  This movie holds a special place in my heart.|, Impossible not to cry at this scene. Whenever I feel down or unmotivated, this film raises my spirit and changes my mindset right after!!|, Rudy is a true hero to us all.  He beat cancer, stood up to oppresion, and donated an orphanage.
The heart of a champion, I tell you.|, The best football film ever made. I love that he got his chance to play in the game. The support of his teammates made that moment surreal.|, I'm man enough to admit that every time I watch this scene and they raise him up in the air at the end I cry. This man worked sooooo hard for 4 years. Being put down and going through every obstacle to get there. Nobody believed in him. The build up from the entire film to this moment is what makes you cry. This man deserved this moment in Norte Dame history.|, Man this scene is so powerful. I love how he proved all the doubters wrong and I’m glad his dad had a chance to see him play in person and watch his son make the last play. He NEVER gave up on his dream. Even when people said he was too small or he wasn’t your prototypical athlete he had heart, and toughness and he was beyond resilient. One of my all time favorite football movies.|, I've probably seen this clip 100+ times and cried EVERY time. Every second of it is perfect. Ned Beatty, John Dutton; everyone.|, It’s fair to say that this scene is notorious for making grown tough guys cry, even guys who aren’t really even football fans. The human drama is super intense, and the musical score only intensifies it. But also, the whole thing with his parents AND brother Frank, all there to finally see that he was telling the truth, is extraordinarily satisfying. Even Frank was in tears at the end. Awesome!"

But let's see what the critics and box office have to say...|, Ever since Lily Collins played in Mortal Instruments I struggle to see her in other roles. shes an amazing actress, but that movie was awesome, the books were even better. She fits the character so well.|, For my interpretation of this movie, it is about choice.

Howard is afraid to choose a single thing.
Marla still don’t know how to choose. 
Frank has a strong sense of what he want to choose. 

At the end, Marla was able to learn how while Howard is still stuck at a crossroad. Frank becomes what he choose to be at the very start.|, When you see a Lily Collins movie and you end up watching every movie which has her in it.My fave Lily Collins movie is Love Rosie|, Lily is so incredibly beautiful.|, Damn it I've found myself watching random trailers again.|, this actually looked really good.

It's hard to make something completely original today but this felt rather fresh. Costa Rica is not exactly shown here as the advanced eco paradise, I always thought it was.|, Love the speech at 2:03. I have been sceptical about Benman, but he's definitely improving his bad guy-persona.

Can you believe that the filmmaker behind this movie and PYM is the same person who played Camilla Bowles in The Crown season 3 and 4?

I can't wait to see this movie.|, As an Argentinian I think that this movie is going to be really good, I mean it has an amazing cast and plot, but I still prefer the original one, not only because it is Argentinian and well is my country and my language but the book, and the football passion that Sandoval (now Julia Roberts' character) has its just brilliant, and it's weird that now we are going to see him as a woman
PS: sorry for the tipping mistakes |, I'm so happy that people comment about watching the original :D
It is actually as everyone says a masterpiece!!!|, If you are considering watching this movie, I URGE you to first watch the original. El Secreto De Sus Ojos was an absolute master piece, regardless of any opinions about this upcoming film. Argentina truly blew me away, there is no doubt in me on why the original won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2010. They already changed a lot of major points in the ""American"" version and it will definitely not be the same movie. However, that makes me even more persistent on watching the original!! I am very curious to how this film will come out.|, I can not wait to see this in theaters! Julia Roberts in full force. And what a cast!|, Love Julia Roberts, can't wait for this movie to come out. She will be spectacular as usual. |, The original is a masterpiece|, I'm a HUGE Julia fan, I love all of her movies... Can't wait to see this one!"

So glad to see her in a comedy role!!|, The most Wes Anderson film that he didn’t direct. I dig it.|, So happy to see ""whodunits"" like this coming out. Rian Johnson's Knives Out with its stellar casting and spider-web of a story introduced so much more to the murder mystery genre, and I can't wait to see what director Tom George has to bring to the table with this.

Also the new Knives Out film ""Glass Onion"" will be releasing this holiday season, so definitely looking forward to that as well. 🗡🔍|, This looks too funny! Sam Rockwell's deadpan expressions in the trailer are perfection and Miss Ronan's over eagerness and goofiness is charming!!! Good, solid cast as well. Mom and I will try to see it in September.|, Love this trailer!! Absolutely love the set up and tone for the set design, costume design, and actors!! 🎥 Also excited for Saoirse Ronan’s performance as well! This definitely gives me some major Wes Anderson and Grand Budapest vibes as well!! 🎥|, The fact that this movie isn't directed by Wes Anderson still leaves me in a complete awe.|, Just saw it. Its exactly what it advertises. Exactly what i was hoping for. .  Saoirse ronan in a new uplifting role. Quirky and hilarious. The supporting cast is spot on. The artistic style immersive and thoroughly creative, with some comedic upheaval sprinkled on.  Reminiscent to grand buddhapest in a way, though set in a more noir style mystery."

Selma,"Selma Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Oprah Winfrey, Cuba Gooding Jr. Movie HD",x6t7vVTxaic,5894405,30431,3302,"I found this movie to be incredibly inspiring, even as a white man I can appreciate and congratulate the courage, persistence and self-restraint shown by MLK and the rest of the black people. There were many times throughout this movie where I found myself angry and upset over the harsh treatment, so I cannot imagine how it would have felt actually being apart of such a discriminated group back then.


MLK is a hero.|, ""What happens when a man stands up and says enough is enough?""
I have seen this trailer more than six times and I still get goosebumps everytime!|, i just saw this movie today, and my honest opinion on it is very simple. BEST. MOVIE. EVER. The most incredible movie  of our time. I have no words to express the emotions in this film. No wonder why it won a Golden Globe for Best Film. Everyone should see this. In fact in the end, everyone was hugging eachother and crying and smiling. Certain movies change lives. This, is one of them.|, I am so happy my history teacher took our entire grade to see this in the theatres to inform us on this type of stuff|, This was a great movie. My heart goes out to my fellow ancestors who suffered for me to be able to vote and walk the streets freely. I give thanks to Oprah especially and also all the cast members who made this movie possible. This movie is much needed to remind us of how lucky we are today. I really wanted my kids to see this movie and be exposed to this. My goal is to teach them their BLACK history because the school are not designed to. They are all European traditional curriculums. In AMERICA, we are not  fully free but we are here. I'm thankful for that.|, I saw this movie back in 7th grade social studies class it's was incredible and very emotional to see how hard my people have fought for our freedom.Much respect to those who lost their lives for our freedom rest in peace and thank you🙏💖|, Grande homem, o mundo precisa de mais pessoas assim!!!|, This looks like pure cinematic greatness. Watching this for sure and wanting to watch her earlier film ""Middle of Nowhere"" as well. Ava DuVernay is going to be a director to look forward to in the coming years.|, this trailer still gives me chills. somebody obviously went through a hell of a lot of pains to make it look as much like the real thing as possible|, It's been a long time since a movie brought tears to my eyes, such a great movie"
Serendipity,Serendipity Official Trailer #1 - (2001) HD,ePU2Ux9JIMM,3337048,12918,708,"probably the best romantic movie out there. the way john cusack and kate beckinsale have sparks in their eyes is so realistic it really makes me believe they are made for each other. the chemistry is so good that i do not even question the 10 year time span. i am really thankful for this movie. watched it like 2 years ago for the first time and it literally made me feel good for a whole week. this has something magical.|, Can’t believe it took me 21 years to see this film. Finally saw it tonight. I loved it!|, This film is so nostalgic for me. It was always my favorite. Those were the days. When rom-coms were actually good and had the best sound tracks 💓1995-2005|, I'm so in love with this movie. I literally love everything about this film. Same goes for A Lot Like Love and About Time.|, Watch this one every Christmas. Definitely ranks in my top 10 all time favs. Keeps me company with no kids or a girlfriend even but somehow this movie gives me that warm fuzzy feeling anyway.|, ""Life is a river ,it carries you to your future whether you wanna go or not...""
Best movie ever it tells everything about life and destiny 👌👌❤|, for me the movie is great :) actually at first i thought it was selfish of them to find each other when they're both engage with different person but overall it reflects human behavior. their personalities was like a mirror to a human soul when it comes to love,  it's either you'll turn yourself to a stubborn looking for your pipe dream or marry someone and pay for eternity of empty-ness that the one you marry can never ever fill (Coz you know even though human beings have some striking resemblance to each other we still do have some differences that makes us unique).  I mean their is no harm in the message of the movie, It just display how our actions affects our future, its all about decision making that we do everyday. and i am not saying go to NY and bump to a stranger days before Christmas, like what Sara said in the movie ""soulmate is a very crucial term to use about what's happening to your life"" but its not a crime to do what makes you happy even if it means breaking your fiance's heart for the fact that you've been dating for like countless years/ living together and he still doesn't have any idea of what your finger's size is (It kinda breaks my heart co'z the movie showed how Lars take Sara for granted). no hate guys just love the movie and NO I didn't come here because of BTS and other stars.|, I absolutely love this movie I've watched it so many times|, I watched it for the first time today. I gotta say it is such a good movie. I was having a hard time these past few weeks. I feel a lot better now. I mean this is how movies are supposed to make you feel, right? Optimistic and hopeful about life and the future.|, A few years ago I watched this movie and was absolutely in love with it. Now it crossed my mind but I couldn't remember the name so I was like ""What was the name...hmm okay there was a book...it was destiny related...let's search that"" and here I am fate led me back to this lovely movie!!

Settlers,The Settlers New Allies Review - They never even tried!,FwJY0zn6zO8,208159,6679,1065,"FYI any messages that tell you to go to Telegram for a free gift using my name are fake, there are no free prizes, it's a scam bot.|, It's mind blowing that the managers really directed their team to make this travesty. Can you imagine being so arrogant that they thought it would work? They could have just made the game we actually wanted and taken the mickey with the monetisation and we'd have taken it just to get a good game.|, This has to be one of the funniest game reviews I've ever heard in my life 😂|, The director of the game said early last year that they had to redesign the game as the gameplay systems they originally designed were overcomplicated.  Everything nowadays has to be made so even an infant can solve it, having to engage in critical thinking is too hard for everyone's feeble little brain meats.|, Reminds of the Settles rise of an empire or whatever it was called. Some scenarios had you paying tribute to a more powerful faction, and if you decided not to pay then they'd tell you they're going to 'teach you a lesson'... And then they never attack, even if you attack them and destroy their army, they'll rebuild their army but never attack back.|, I played this game in beta and the responses from the testers where along the same lines as you have said. It seems to have been made with a focus on pvp battles and ranked battles ie build and army quick and attack the other guy. It was delayed after the beta because of the bad reception and it looks like nothing has changed.|, I have fond memories of The Settlers on the Amiga back in the day and was hoping to revisit the glory days in this latest version. Sadly not to be. Thank you for saving us the trouble and the coin of finding out how far this franchise has fallen. So disappointed.|, This makes me appreceate old games even more|, The miners don't need farms because they are eating ze bugs, and that's all you need to be happy. Eat ze bugs Mac!|, I was late to Settlers, but even Settlers 7 had a complex economy and considerable challenge. You had to start with food, plan for tools, and when you got to gold bars had to choose whether to spend them on clergy, soldiers or traders. Either of those choices required other goods as well (books, weapons, horses, wheels, clothing, etc) with their own production lines. If you expanded too fast the AI would take your undefended land, but if you expanded too slowly you'd run out of resources. The story was decent and the campaign (esp the 2nd one) could be quite difficult when set to harder difficulties. Then the skirmish mode presented tons of options to play vs. AI. I will never buy this 2023 dumbed down garbage."

It has so much potential to be a really good film if they stuck to the books. I wouldn't mind if they changed a few things here and there to make it more compatible to screen but this looks nothing like the books whatsoever! For instance, why are they all speaking with an american dialect?!? It was set in The County which is based off frigging Lancashire! For people who haven't read the books it may be an average film but for fans like me, it looks like it will be a complete and utter disappointment.|, Ive read all the books. More then once. I know this movie is going to be nothing like the book. But by the love of god this movie still looks freaking amazing :) Still going to watch it, feeling like I will enjoy it anyway. No movie is exactly like the book so just enjoy it when it comes out. Looks action packed! Amazing graphics and effects|, I swear, I'm excited for the movies that are coming out! Definitely a really action packed year! |, i really feel like this is just prelude to something that would be an awesome tv show... honestly i wish there was another movie or episode... it was fun, and left an open road for better deeper and more|, I saw this during the previews for #DraculaUntold and it looks good. Never read the books, so I have no preconceived notions on the plot, only that this looks like it'll be a good fantasy adventure to watch.|, This looks really good, I never read the book, but I'm lookin forward to watching this when it comes out on dvd next week on May 26th|, The Seventh son is a good fantasy movie. The plot moves fast has ,decent acting,special effects and action scenes. This movie is way better then Dungeons & Dragons and Eragon.  I just wish the filmmakers had gave the antagonists more of a backstory especially the Axe guy. They should do a part two.|, Yes, there are some big changes, but books and movies are two separate mediums. What worked in the book won't necessarily work in the movie (and vice-versa). With that being said, this looks very good
and I can't wait to see it.|, Ive been waiting for this movie to come out from a loooooooong time.but each time they keep pushing up the date,its annoying me a lot but I'll still watch it because the trailer looks awesome and ben barnes is in the movie and he is fabulous, reason enough for me to watch the movie|, This is so different from the books in every way possible...still, I've been waiting for the movie a really long time and I will watch it...even if it will totally crush my expectations"

My dad gone now and it brings back just so much memories…never thought that life would go by this fast:(|, 0:43 that riff.. i get goosebumps every time. makes me want to fall in love, it gives me this feeling when something is so beautiful that it breaks your heart. when it’s too pretty to be true, so it hurts|, I need more songs with this exact vibe 😢|, Esta canción siempre me recordara a cuando estaba conociendo al que creí seria el amor para toda mi vida.. mientras tomábamos vodka y esta canción tan borrachos mirándonos y las estrellas........|, Can this song give u serotonin and depression at the same time ?

Just watched it today, and it completely exceeded all the expectations that I had.
The casting, the story, the fight scenes, I LOVED EVERYTHING!! No stereotypes, Chinese and Chinese-American culture was portrayed so well and respectfully.  
L O V E D  I T|, As someone who was getting bored of the MCU, I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. IMO the best MCU film in years.|, Without a doubt one of the best and most underrated MCU movies ever created.|, Love everything about this movie! Good origin story, great cast and awesome action scenes. Simu, Meng'er, Awkwafina, and Tony definitely nailed the role. I also love what writers and director did with the power of the ten rings but I do suspect it may have been invented by Phastos (Eternals) since the rings are so advanced and also very ancient at the same time. Eternals came to Earth 5000 yrs ago while Xu Wenwu found the ten rings 1000 yrs ago (Sersi and Phastos made lots of ancient & advanced weapon artifacts in Eternals movie) OR the rings could be from another universe that may be connected to Kang variant. Hopefully marvel studios will add more asian actors for the sequel and make the Shang-Chi family bigger.|, Abomination hit Wong so hard that it opened a MultiVerse.|, This trailer doesn’t even do it justice. This movie is incredible!!!|, The fight choreographer for this brilliant movie - Brad Allan, a member of Jackie Chan's stunt team - just passed away on August 7 from an unspecified illness.

Also I hope the entire team still acts like children and teenagers even after transforming like in the first movie.|, I really do hope that this Shazam is kept in the new plans of James Gunn, because from all the superhero movies DC made in the last years, this adaptation not only feels accurate to the character, but it really has place to grow, in difference with the other ones that just kinda ends there.|, The casting for adult Shazam just feels so spot on, especially in this trailer|, I can’t stop thinking about the foster parents.

She Dies Tomorrow,SHE DIES TOMORROW - Trailer,hcMFjCPkP3M,716318,1328,99,"I enjoyed the film. I think the trailer is misleading as well as showing too much. It is not ‘terrifying’, not really a horror film—maybe more like a black comedy. I took it as more a creative visual representation of certain mental and feeling states. It doesn’t have plot or beginning, middle and end in the usual sense. If you can enjoy the visuals and acting as it flows, rather than wanting a solution or resolution you might enjoy it. The pleasure is more in recognizing, “that is how I have felt and thought at certain times, and the film captured that well.”|, Looks dope! Feels a lot like the paranoia a lot of us are feeling in these strange times.|, What a cool idea. With the anxiety ridden society of today this is a perfect.|, It looks amazing!|, I strongly recommend the ponderous, very well acted, narratively ambiguous, beautifully shot, black comedy, art-indie film, ‘She Dies Tomorrow’ - it’s really good.|, If the intention was to make characters look like one dimesional cardboard cutouts repeating the same thing over and over, i would say this film is a success.|, In my opinion I'm not even going to take a bite at it because Aron Moorhead didn't take at least some part in it.|, I haven't seen it yet, but I'm pretty sure she's gonna die tomorrow.|, Amazing xx|, Oh shit. Now I think I'm going to Die Tomorrow. Looks Cool.."
She Said,SHE SAID | Official Trailer,i5pxUQecM3Y,12803984,14194,1937,"Just finished this movie, it was so good. People are saying the ""industry"" is profiting off of this, but he was NOT apart of Universal Pictures. This is also based on the book and was very accurate to the real-life events. It's important for media to speak up like this on really uncomfortable topics, and to do it with respect to the victims. This movie did so brilliantly|, Carey Mulligan is an incredible actress. Yes despite having two Oscar noms in her belt, for some reason I think she's still very underrated. This looks amazing, journalists movies are the type of movies that I'm so interested in seeing it|, This looks like it will be a great movie and I *might* watch it. But does anyone else find it kind of ridiculous/crazy/terrible that the industry that was protecting Weinstein for so long (and how many others?) is now going to make money off of that? Am I missing something?|, I watched this film last night - great acting, I loved that they involved some of Harvey's real-life victims to tell their own story, it felt very empowering and moving to watch, made me cry several times in one sitting! I think that it's interesting that Hollywood protected Weinstein for so long and now they're profiting of off it, but it's done by people (female director and crew mainly) who are trying to change the face of Hollywood and use it to bring a voice to more and more sexual harassment/sexual violence victims, so it's a strange juxtaposition.|, i love films like this. Not just because of the womens stories but also the exposure of injustice when there is so much of it and literally no accountability active. These reminders that we are doing things terribly are always so helpful, especially when they are packaged in such an exciting manner|, This honestly seems like something of a spiritual successor to Spotlight. While I know Spotlight wasn’t the first movie of its kind, these two seem to be very similar. I love Carey Mulligan and it’s great to see Zoe Kazan getting really meaty dramatic roles|, How brave, these 2 women uncovered a ""conspiracy"" that literally everyone in Hollywood knew about.|, this has been on my watch list for a while. so glad i finally watched it. very well-made and told the stories of many women who deserved to be told. made me tear up and cry in a few places.|, This is an incredible film, if you're unsure just watch it. Thank you to the team who made it and more importantly to all the women who did and didn't come forward, you are all incredible.|, Carey was brilliant in Promising Young Woman, I can’t wait to see her in this"

Shin Godzilla,Shin Godzilla - Official Trailer,3qX1ZU3jcfU,694743,8136,335,"Best Godzilla movie ever. The way it shows how people and the government would actually react to something as catastrophically destructive as Gojira is amazingly realistic and believable. The overall feels is just so tense and keeps us over the edge of our seat. 10/10 easy. Better than any of the USA ones. No disrespect intended though, the American movies are great, it's just...this one's better.|, It's hard to believe no broadcast venue has shown this. Shin remains an unseen gem to many.|, Makes you wonder how colossal this movie could've been, if it had Monsterverse level budgets and marketing done.|, This movie is essentially a perfect Godzilla film. There is a slight low-budget feel to it that I'd argue is a defining feature of the original Godzilla films. Would've loved to see this in cinema.|, God damn i always keep comming back to watch this trailer. The presentation is amazing. No need of a fancy dialogue followed up by some loud bass noises, some action scenes and a joke scene at the end.

The creative team behind the edit were amazing.|, This is my favourite trailer ever. The music combined with that last far away shot of godzilla, and the roar.|, I love how the trailer feels very old-timey, hearkens back to the old Godzilla movies.|, You can feel the tension even from just watching the trailer :0|, This has to be one of the best movie trailers I've seen, and it doesn't even spoil all the best bits; perfect trailer|, This trailer is beautiful and it doesn't even do true justice to the masterpiece of Shin Godzilla. Mind blowing movie"

This looks almost like it!!|, No matter they were a fan or not, as long as they know what Ultraman is, everyone that I know who watched this trailer either in the internet or in the cinemas before a particular film starts always gets impressed by it. The trailer is just amazing.

As for the film itself, I wouldn't say you could expect much from it, but you'll enjoy it a lot if you understood the many references it makes from the first TV series. Hoping for the success of continuation.|, I love how it gives nods to the tv show. Don't @ me for not knowing what they're called but keeping the look of the laser blasts from his hands was great. Or how he flies like the model in the old days, even though CGI could have been employed to make him less static in flight. Fingers are crossed for a US release.|, Before watching the movie, I'm impressed by the comment section here.
I am proud that Japanese Ultraman is loved so much in the world.
And thank you for screening this film in Malaysia.
Thank you.

ありがとうございます。|, I remember watching ultraman as a kid and how much I loved it. This trailer brings back so many memories.|, Besides how awesome this trailer is, notice how they *officially* actually called the monsters kaiju!!|, I just found out about this movie. I was bummed when I heard they canceled the one from 2016. I can't wait to see this!!!!!!! This looks AWESOME!!!!!! 
I never thought that at 56 years old I would see a new ""classic"" Ultraman on the big screen.|, Just brought back so many good memories of growing up in the late 70's.
Just bought my ticket for this Wednesday. 
Super excited. 
Also, it has fantasy, romance, AND friendship.|, Just watched it, basically an entire multiple seasons long Ultraman series shrunk into a 2 hour film. Brought back pleasant memories, so I'm not disappointed.|, When I was a very little boy, every morning I would watch Ultraman.  So good to see he's still out there fighting for Earth."

Sicario,"Sicario TRAILER 1 (2015) - Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro Movie HD",G8tlEcnrGnU,7733505,29066,1730,"For me the most powerful scene in this movie is when they are on the rooftop watching the battles going on in Mexico then for a second you see the police lights heading towards the gunfire.  Such a powerful scene, it hits you hard and makes you think that their are real cops in Mexico going lights and sirens towards what is technically combat, also not knowing if the person next to you is going to pull their gun on you.
Don't buy coke people, you buy coke means you supporting the war in Mexico.|, Benicio del Toro deserves another Oscar for his performance. Amazing.|, The dinner table scene alone was worth the price of admission. Benicio, what a performance. His switch in mood in that moment, and yet he does not move! Only a handful of actors, masters of their trade can do that. Hypnotic, less is more.|, I love this movie. The pace of the story. The lines. It was just spot on.|, This film hits hard, whoever did the soundtrack and the music was absolutely spot on fking hit the nail on the head.|, Seriously excited for this.  One of the best things about Edge of Tomorrow was how surprisingly convincing Emily Blunt was in an action role.|, This movie is not for everyone, however this movie is a masterpiece ""TO ME"".|, Emily Blunt is probably one of the best actresses alive nowdays and also one of the most underrated ones. And with Villeneuve, an extraordinary director responsable of films like Prisoners and Incendies, I really hope she finally gets the credit she deserves now than she has proved than she can play any role she wants.
This looks really good, Villaneuve is able to create an insane atmosphere of tension and mistery, he proved that in Prisoners. Can't wait to see this.|, Best movie I saw in 2015. Incredible performance by the entire cast. Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro should win Oscars for this film.|, 10/10, outstanding film, go see it."

The characters were very well-developed, and the plot was just as great as the first one, if not more intriguing.
I don't understand the bad reviews this film got, but I guess everyone should see it for themselves. But after it was over, I was VERY satisfied after watching Sinister 2 than the first one. I thought this was a very good film overall.|, I loved this movie, even more than the first one actually. It's different from all those stupid cliche horror movies.
This movie's got a great story and it's actually scary (I'm guessing it's mainly because of the children, because children are friggin horrifying, especially when they murder their entire family).|, This movie is literally amazing. The difference between the two ( sinister & sinsiter 2 ) is that the first movie focuses more on putting the story together and really finding out what's going on. Other than the second one which it is more focused on the kids and how the children our corrupted. I really enjoyed this movie and I definetly give it a 5 out of 5.|, 2:03 almost gave me a heart attack 2 years ago, and still gets me every time!|, The first sinister was amazing, one of the best horror movies I have seen. My friends and I watched it together not knowing anything about it and left the room we watched it in shivering all over. The concept was amazing and we lost our shit with fright in some scenes. I am hyped for this movie sooooooooo much, really hope it lives up to the name|, The reason Sinister 2 is not good is because Bughuul's face has been revealed too often and theres no mystery. Mystery is scary.﻿|, One of the best horror movies,definitely! I've seen the first part and now I can't wait for the second one. :D|, I liked the first Sinister a lot...more disturbing-freaky-creepy than scary and that's what gets under your skin. This Sequel looks really good too with more scares and the children! Can't wait to see it!|, I've never seen Sinister 1 but I did see this trailer in theaters last night before Insidious 3 and that right there is enough to make me go watch it. This looks awesome. I was surprised too see it was even a sequel. The plot looked so original. Definitely seeing this in theaters|, I haven’t seen this movie yet, I think it will ben good, it looks really scary and the jumpscares look great. But I really doubt that it’ll be as scary as the first one, the mistery and everything you didn’t know and see was what made it so damn good"

This looks like one of those movies where you switch off your brain, sit back and enjoy the action and violence.|, This movie was awesome. Saw it last weekend with like 20 people in the theatre and we all were in awe. $6 million budget and it was well well well exceeded what they spent in dollars. Props to the whole crew for making this look like a $100 mill budget film. Please keep low budget artistic projects going! Thank you lionsgate|, I just saw it 3 days ago. There were 4 elderly people in the theater so 5 total in attendance. They all had canes. We all clapped, laughed and cheered at the same moments! The best movie to be released since Top Gun Maverick.|, Saw this last night.  Bl00dy awesome.  
So glad I made time to catch this on the big screen. Gripping from start to finish. Literally in the edge of my seat the entire time. Amazing cinematography. Bloody violence. And vengeance a-plenty.  Great mix of genres handled expertly by the director. 
Highly recommended.|, Just watched it and had a blast haha 1h30m of pure havoc, gore and laughs :D kept smiling throughout the whole movie! Definitely one of the best in its genre!|, I found this movie well worth the wait. I had read so much about it that it was unbearable to see just the trailer of who this man really was. Jorma Tommila was incredible in his role as a man who had lost everything! A nearly broken man who only wanted happiness in life with a child and wife. Then, to prospect for gold as a last resort and found an enriched vein that went beyond his expectations only to get robbed by a group of nazi criminals. What a mistake that was. I loved the imaginative ways that he used to kill his enemy and to find enslaved women who were more than willing to help him to get his revenge.  I was on the edge of my couch the whole time! This was gritty, viand downright raw!  This was exactly how the war affected people in the most heinous ways.  

 Courage and Bravery in the face of adversity.  Jalmari Helander did an excellent job of directing this film really showing the fear in each German soldier. That, and the Third Reich didn't understand or could ever comprehend such a force as this man!

Outstanding film.|, While this is the most un-Finnish americanized story about a Finn that I've ever seen (being from Finland myself), I'm happy to see Finnish SISU at least get some international recognition.|, Meu sonho assistir esse filme no cinema  ❤|, In memory to Finnish WW2 heroes. All the best from Poland!|, OH MAN! This movie is SICK! a great movie enjoyed after a very long time. Great action and cinematography.

Skinamarink,Skinamarink - Official Trailer [HD] | A Shudder Original,APQqilSTxz0,2783410,34490,4179,"This is surprisingly accurate to what it's like being a kid in a creepy dark house. There's an atmosphere unlike any other|, As someone who has dealt with weekly nightmares and sleep paralysis this film absolutely got me. Trying to sleep that night was incredibly difficult. Probably not a film for everyone, but definitely well made and spooky as hell if this is a semi common thing you deal with.|, One of my favorite parts of this trailer is how it subverts your expectations (whether or not that was intentional) it recreates most horror movie trailers with  a deep voice reading off lines 
Like “In this house…” after that you’d expect him to say “Fear takes hold…” or some cheesy line but instead he just repeats “In this house” as if the trailer itself has been corrupted as the voice is distorted repeatedly|, I don't remember the last time I wanted to cover my eyes watching a horror movie. I was practically begging this movie to end because I didn't want to experience the horror and the tension anymore. The relief I felt when it ended was palpable.|, This film perfectly captures that feeling that you get when you’re home alone, especially as a child. That, even if it seems it’s only you in the dark, you always have that feeling that you are not alone when you look in the pitch black.|, I never get scared by horror films but this one DEFINITELY got me. Silence, scary noises and darkness. I really like that they use darkness to mess with you. Since the mind can play tricks when in the dark|, Just saw this film. 

My suggestions to anyone wanting to watch it; if you’re looking to have the best experience with the film, watch it alone or with people that don’t talk during movies. If you don’t it may spoil it’s highly unique atmosphere designed to draw you in through vivid imagery and sound design. 

Be patient with this film. It is not your typical formulaic setup. It is much like how the trailer presents it, but a much longer and more suspenseful and tense version. 

I can’t say I’d recommend this to many people, it’s kind of a thing where you just have to try it for yourself and see how it makes you feel.|, my favorite part is when the skinamarink appeared and said his iconic line ""its skinamarinking time"" and then skinamarinked in this house|, Been a horror enthusiast for over 10 years and I literally cannot remember the last time a movie made me that scared. Absolute atmospheric horror masterpiece|, This trailer really nails the feeling of ""fucked up disjointed nightmare that makes you wake up in a cold sweat."" 
I've had nightmares like this before and they have always genuinely terrified me. It's like that instinctual fear in the pit of your stomach that's really hard to describe"

Only silence
Has an ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to
Make me feel like
There is nothing left of me
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
As the smoke clears
I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you
Feel better
To watch me while I bleed

Still are broken

But I am closer to the clouds up here

You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground

Saw this beautiful film in 2021 and I fell in love with it. Thank you!|, This was by far one of the most amazing movies I've ever watched in my life.|, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks had incredible on screen chemistry. Beside this movie, i love You've got mail and When Harry Met Sally too.|, I wanted so much to watch this movie and I watched it tonight and it left me amazed <3 Love this movie <3|, I’m Japanese and I remember watching this movie in English class when I was in university in Japan. This makes me feel very sentimental. I’m 32 and still feel like I’m in my 20s. Getting old, man 😩|, Although I thoroughly enjoy “When Harry Met Sally” (Billy Crystal is so unbelievably cute) and “You’ve Got Mail”, this movie has such fun characters, beautiful chemistry among them, and a story that’s timeless and yet perfectly in sync of its era. Young Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks…absolutely gorgeous people who are SO adorable together. Plus the son Jonah, friends/coworkers, the dynamic of distance yet still being attracted to each other, Sam’s deceased spouse causing grief, all of it adds to their personalities which equals a love story that is unique, relatable, but still straight out of a fairy tail. I always get butterflies watching this and that’ll never change. Tom Hanks will forever be one of my biggest crushes and this film is EXACTLY why😩❤️|, i’ve seen this movie over a dozen times it’s so amazing|, I can’t believe I just saw this movie in 2023.

Sleight,Sleight Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Trailers,ORL1d7GWoBc,3557314,22264,1403,"This actually looks like a really good movie! It's like a stand alone superhero movie, that's not bound by cinematic universes, or textual backgrounds, making it somewhat limitless when it comes to creativity and scriptwriting. The review was correct in that it seems to be massively ""genre-bending"". I just hope it's as good as the trailer.|, This movie is amazing I just hope we get a sequel or a series... This deserves more attention!|, This movie actually looks good. You know the movies gonna be good when they barely give anything away in the trailer but still make it interesting.|, This movie deserves a sequel. I fell in love with it man|, This was such an entertaining and amazing movie. I’d like to see more.|, Really good movie. It wasn't what I thought from the first previews I saw, like a ""superhero movie"", but it was very good nonetheless and keeps your interest through out. I could see it turning into a superhero type movie though. That would be fire. It had a very realistic point of view with a twist of sinister and heroism. I would definitely suggest parents that have young kids, specifically boys that are curious or impressionable of the streets. This movie might turn on a light in a different perspective. Unless your kid is 'special' then it will backfire so don't let them see it if that's the case. lol|, ""We can do whatever we want, if we could just believe we're able to""

Inspiring|, Excellent movie.  Starts a little slow, but builds a steady burn. Well worth the watch.  Fantastic young actor.|, Now THIS is the kind of superpower movie I wanted to see!! Able to trick people into thinking his power is basic magic and be a REAL person that people in modern society are ACTUALLY going through! Can't wait to see just from my first time seeing the trailer!|, This movie was unexpectedly really good. i was not expecting this movie to be as good as it was, i was expecting at least a three star film. you know sometimes these lower budget movies are better than the high budget films/blockbusters. this movie had a lot of heart about a teenager who loses his parents and it's only him and his sister and he is trying to take care of her by doing magic during the day and dealing drugs at night. but he wants out of it and when the drug dealing goes wrong he uses his magic skills in a superhero type form to get out. what i appreciate about this movie is spoiler that the drug dealer actually gets out and makes his life better. other movies that have to do with the drug dealing scenario the character usually dies or continues to do what he tries to get out of. this is a new and fresh way on that scenario. this movie is like spider-man meets boyz n the hood just like it says on the case. i could not explain it any better. the acting is good, special effects are good, story is good and the directing is good. the only nit pick i have about this movie is that i wished there was a little bit more action. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. until next time have a cinematastic day rating 5/5"

He is perfect material for a “horror drama” with great characters.|, All you need to know is that this is the greatest comedy I have ever seen.

The cinematography is amazing, the soundtrack is tense and unnerving, the jump scares are properly executed. Worth the watch!|, This movie is actually much better than it looks from the promo. Not just scary happenings and killings but very well played and planned what is the real problem and how to make it scare and imagine what if it would be on yourself.
The main character was very logical and knowing the human intelligence level it describes very well how it can be very problematic and how you can be very alone instantly because of everyone's ability to believe and understand only something that they see and have learned. And the woman was in summary pretty smart. Although, I think in this condition, I would ask everybody just to lock me in chains or something and would have stopped to meet everyone completely just in case.

BRILLIANT|, ""Well, nobody's perfect"" is still one of the funniest ever lines uttered in a major motion picture from Hollywood!  ""Some Like It Hot"" is just amazingly well done and is about as close to perfect as you can make a comedy!|, Fun fact: the original version of his response was, “I know,” but they were forced to change it. Honestly though, this is much funnier, and keeps the spirit of the original line intact, anyway.|, “Nobody’s perfect” a line so good Billy Wilder actually had it engraved on his tombstone|, I love how Jack looks so wistful when he says he can never have children|, Jack Lemon's expressions after that final line are comedic dynamite!|, It is incredible to me that these lines were uttered in 1959.  I was born forty years after this, but few films still dare to share the same message. ""i am a man"" ""No one is perfect"" <3|, Just another proof that Jack Lemmon is the greatest comedian of all time. He played whole movie, most notably this scene, to perfection.|, Something tells me, he knew all along."
Somewhere in Queens,Somewhere in Queens | Official Trailer | Available on Hulu,T_YDDN66Q1I,1308384,3943,275,"I love Ray Romano. He has such a visceral love for family, and it comes through in his work|, I just saw this movie on Hulu for the first time, and I just want to say it was such a great movie to watch. Such a heartwarming story throughout the whole movie and it was just a great movie overall. I wish I had heard about it sooner. I also wish the movie would have won awards. I really haven’t seen much from Ray Romano since he did ice age but I’m glad to see that he still out there acting and making movies. I’m going to have to check out more of his work and see what I’ve missed throughout the years!|, I just came back from watching the movie. I loved it. It's a timeless slice-of-life movie that's about family, good intentions (the mistakes that come with it), failure, and growth in finding a different path in life.

I can't compare it to anything else. Ray Romano and Laurie Metcalf did awesome performances. If this is Romano's style behind the camera, I'd like to see more.|, This looks awesome, real, with good writing and great actors you don’t need those massive fake green screens, so far I’m loving it, might just go into our Christmas movie watching list|, This looks wonderful. I already feel the tears in my eyes.|, Best real movie in a  very long time, Ray Romano -Laurie Metcalf give Award Winning performances . My wife and I laughed , cried and so many more emotions in between.... growing up on Long Island with the last name Benedetto ,Sunday dinner scene was spot on ...... A must watch.|, As an Italian American, that dinner scene was VERY accurate 😂 also Sadie Stanley reminds me of Madelyn Cline. They could play sisters.|, Two words: Laurie Metcalf
I’m all in.🙌
I would watch her in a film where she watches paint dry. 😂|, This movie I will see, it's about time a real movie was made without all the violence and other garbage.  Love the scene about more meatballs, can relate to that!!!  The Italians have the best sense of humor and the best food.|, I would watch Laurie Metcalf sit and read a phone book in complete silence. She is fabulous."

And blessed is who doesn't just know about Him, but KNOWS Him...|, Proud to be christian proud to be son of almighty Jesus|, ""I'm coming soon""  This just chills the excitement within. Like if you believe that this line is not just a part of the script.|, This film played one of the main roles in my growing up in the faith. I think I started reading the Bible after that, and that's where my life changes completely. All Glory and Praise be to our Lord Jesus Christ.

It doesn’t stick with a specific genre, which I LOVE. However the performances, cinematography, editing, story, and direction all stay consistently immaculate. It also manages to touch on a variety of real world issues and conveys powerful messages throughout. I’m blown away by this movie.|, They finally gave this man his own movie, that’s dope. He’s a really good actor|, As a black guy who works in customer service, i can relate to the ""white voice"" its actually a thing as sinister as its sounds|, This movie started off wholesome then will suddenly make you feel like you slipped into the multiverse lol. It's hilarious but actually quite dark. As someone who also struggles with money, I kinda understand how people like cash can get desperate just to make a way out of their situations. 
They perfectly captured how society works in a weird and creative way.|, Lakeith Stanfield is phenomenal. Such a great actor that I think can truly play any role thrown at him. Can't wait for this release.|, This movie made me feel like I was watching 2 hours of Black Mirror|, Definitely out of the box type of movie ..  was not expecting the weird dystopia type world.|, This movie was so unique, I really wasn't expecting it to be freaking bizarre and nuts and I LOVED it|, i just got back from seeing this and i don’t think i’ve ever been more blindsided by a movie in my life. please go watch it for yourself and ignore everyone else|, Saw this last night, great film.  There's a lot to take in so it's probably worth it to go see it twice.  There's quite a bit going on, it's well written and well acted.  These are the types of movies folks need to go pay to see in the theater in order to support this kind of film making."

She spent her whole life working to raise awareness for it. She would have been so happy to see this .|, its honestly disgusting and somewhat frightening the number of people attacking this film or trying to put it down, like you don't have to like the film but the message is something everyone should be able to get behind and rally around.|, In our theater tonight, not one person got up during the film. We all clapped at the end. It was an amazing experience.|, The fact that, despite having numerous tries of taking it down, this movie went on to become one of the most successful independent films ever really shows how its message needs to be said and seen, showing how vile the media can be when trying to keep it silent.|, Jim always taking on roles that he believes in. Doesnt matter if his career is on the line. Respect to this man|, Wow. Just saw this movie last night and it was incredible. It's truly heartbreaking seeing what this world has come to and the amount of sick people that surround us. They did an amazing job telling this story.|, Even the trailer made me cry.  This isn't about being left or right, this is about humanity and our children.|, This movie was simply heartfelt and amazing. It’s so sad this happens in our world|, Just watched the movie, its hard to watch without feeling anger inside, its heavy and very powerful and the entire world needs to tune in, the inspiration and motivation this movie took me by is on a whole new level. GODS CHILDREN ARE NOT FOR SALE.|, This movie is such an amazing movie !

Cried, gave them both a kiss and told them how much I love them. This movie is deep yo! Nothing drives you more than a father‘s love for his daughter and his wife👊🏽❤️👊🏽❤️👊🏽❤️|, Hands down the best movie I've ever seen!! I cried like a little biaaaaaaaaaatch and I'm proud to say that|, Idk if it was because I'm a cry baby but I absolutely LOVED this movie and honestly I cried throughout the entire movie which means literally every scene.... |, This is the BEST movie I have seen in a very long time. Not only does it have insanely amazing fight scenes but its a extreamly moving movie. Respect to ALL the actors and their boxing trainers who clearly worked very hard to show people what commitment and dedication people who do this sport or mixed martial arts have.|, This movie was awesome. It's not a movie about love or revenge it's about finding yourself. Amazing acting|, I first thought the trailer was giving too much away but the story turns out completely different to what I excepted. I just saw the movie a few hours ago and I would gladly watch it again now, it was so amazing, I cried throughout the entire film. Must see!|, Even after watching the trailer( which spoils the movie) this movie was awesome. It really got me emotion on some part.

Please bring back the Looney Tunes show. 🥺
We love the adult theme that the show has and i’m pretty sure most of us are willing to pay to watch it. Please consider bringing it back. 🙏🏻|, I actually understand why this movie was delayed for so long now. They were tirelessly pumping money into acting lessons for Lebron to absolutely no avail.|, When I first watched this in theaters. I was lost for words. I didn’t know what to think of it. But the more I watch it, the more I grow on it and it appeals to me. It did still give me that vibe that the whole basketball game in this film gave me the same old vibe the original Space Jam did  just with a modern twist to it. I think LeBron did a great job with this role. I mean you have to admit. Michael Jordan’s acting in the first one is pretty bland, but LeBron kinda gives the same vibe in this film as Michael did in the original Space Jam. I mean the whole second half of the basketball ball game when they all go looney to make a comeback reminded me EXACTLY of the second half in the original. Plus Porky Pigs rap in the second half of the game had me bursting with laughter. Plus that scene was SO 90’s. Overall, I appreciate this film. I enjoyed it. Of course it’s not as good as the original. But that’s what you have to expect with sequels.|, Is it just me or I love it when they say “🎶Welcome to the space jam🎶”|, A New Legacy can never beat the original _Space Jam._|, This movie is a excuse for Warner Bros to finally use all the characters and universes they own and just put it into a movie. AND I LOVE IT|, A movie about a kid getting blackmailed, but in order to get him back they have to play a game of basketball? Just what I needed in my life|, It honestly doesn’t look bad, like we all had the highest expectations and it looks pretty dope. Better than I expected tbh, would be perfect if there was an MJ cameo too|, I’m a 29 year old adult, and I’m obsessed with this movie lol 😂 I just wish more of my peers who grew up with Space Jam enjoyed it as much as I did. I do not know a soul who liked this movie. They either hate it or refuse to watch it because it’s not Michael Jordan"

We were flying in perfect weather, and afterwards, with special effects they created that storm and clouds. Amazing what they can do.|, Great movie. No cheap or easy jumpscares, but just a great story with great actors.|, This movie is good!! I can't believe it's not more popular. The director and the cast we're spot on. It's so intense it made my hands and feet sweat 🤣|, I’ve never been so emotionally and physically stressed out while watching a movie. I loved it.|, I’m here for it! Loretta Devine playing the “bad guy.” Yes, yes, and YES!|, Really good movie! I don't watch a lot of movies, cause 8/10 movies make me lose interest on the first 40 minutes. This one got me glued to my seat. Nothing cheesy, or cliche, great actors, great setting, great dialogue. One of the best horror/creepy movies out there|, I just got done watching this and what a movie! At the beginning I had no ideal the nightmarish journey this family was on.

Spencer,SPENCER - Official Trailer - In Theaters November 5,WllZh9aekDg,14254502,47584,2802,"Nice|, I just saw Spencer at a film festival. It’s incredibly moving and every detail is mesmerizing, including the film score. Beautifully filmed and acted. I’m hoping it’s rewarded with many awards.|, This movie touched the deepest part of my heart. 
During one part of the movie I started to feel so identified with it that I had a panic attack, I felt so overwhelmed, I felt like I was going to die. It hurts me to see that we allow people to hurt us so much that we reach a point of losing our common sense 
This movie marked a moment in my life.|, I’m do glad they used Spencer as the title. This movie isn’t about her marriage or her royalty. It’s about her. HER.|, I never understood why everyone gave her such a hard time over Twilight, she did everything she could with a character that had basically no character traits other than bookworm, devoted daughter and lover of vampires. It wasn’t her fault Bella was kind of bland. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love Twilight, the books and the movies, but Bella was a fairly empty cup. Stewart is a phenomenal actress, I’m glad people are beginning to see that.|, This role actually makes sense for Kristen. We all remember back in the height of the Twilight mania she was a mega star who loathed the attention and got a lot of flack for not “behaving” the way a hugely over exposed star was expected to. It evidently produced a lot of anxiety for her. I know being an actress is not nearly the same as being THE princess Diana, but still the experience probably gave her something very personal to channel for this role. I bet she slays it.|, This is a perfect example as to why directors and studios should pick the underdog. Kristen is the last choice anyone would have for Princess Diana but here she is proving everyone all wrong. This is going to expand Kristen’s career in a way that will finally show us what she is capable as an actor. Wishing her all the success and love!|, I hate the fact the whole world hates her because of Twilight,yet they didn't watch any other movies she starred in. She played a disabled teenager at ONLY 17 years old,she impersonated both Joan Jett and princess Diana better than anyone ever will. She deserves every single Oscar there is and I'm so glad people are finally noticing her actual talent and realizing how much underrated she was all this time.|, Kristen Stewart's impeccable range in her acting over the years is something to be awe-inspiring about. Her acting skills have shown her to be an outstanding actress in everything that she does, even if the film(s) flop. Just based on this trailer, as most of us have not seen the film yet, Kristen gives a career-best performance in Spencer. Her uncanny charisma, her ability to captivate the audience even in moments of stillness or repose, and she keeps the film watchable even in moments of extreme silliness. This is one film I am completely and utterly waiting to see since they announced that they were in the process of casting the actors and actresses.|, Who's here after Kristen got Oscar nominated!! She absolutely deserves it!!"

In the first movie, he needed his father's guidance, now his mom. This is DOPE! Love to see animators get their respect! People have no idea how much work it takes to make animations.|, I’m still not over how incredibly good this movie is. Everything about this movie is perfection and art. That’s what you call excellent visually stunning filmmaking. It will 100% be one of the top best movies of the year and even of all time|, Okay, after watching the movie, I say: This is the probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not animated movies, but movies. Sony should definitely try to push and make history by nominating for Best Picture Academy Awards. If any animated movie has a chance, this one does and fully deserves the award. I cannot imagine the amount of creative and movie industry work that was put into this masterpiece. Well done!|, This movie is the dream of being an animator is. I just finished watching the movie with my friends and as people who go to an art school, we have never felt more inspired. The art styles, the colours, the music, and let alone the plot??? That was amazing and truely an art piece.|, Is it wrong for me to say that this movie was way better than Into the Spider-Verse? Because it was for me. The animation is jaw-dropping gorgeous and for a movie that is 2 hours and 15 minutes, it never dragged at all. It has brilliant pacing and already has me calling it the best movie of the year so far as well as one of the greatest movies and sequels of all time. It's obviously going to win next year's Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature. Can't wait for Beyond the Spider-Verse.|, The mothers speech to miles brought me to tears as I’m raising a boy myself. It was what sold this for me — besides the stunning visuals, incredible characters and cameos and plot. It was so chocked full of spider-man. All the spideys all the time!!!!! The spidey movie to end all spidey movies.|, So much in love with the visuals and animation! Love this new trend for 3D graphics -Mitchel's vs the Machines, Puss in Boots, and of course these Spider-Verse movies!! Huge kudos to the animation and art teams, AI could never replace you ♡|, I don't say this lightly, but coming back from the theatre tonight I think this is the best movie I've ever seen! I didn't think they could top the near perfection of the first film, but lightning struck twice! I absolutely love all of the main cast and was impressed by how much it rewards you for actively engaging with it. One of the huge later reveals is hinted at much earlier on and if you pick up on it, it's incredibly rewarding to watch the characters learn what you've already realized. I'm definitely going to see this multiple times in theatres and am showing everyone I know!|, Just got back from the cinema after watching this and hands down, it's the most INSANELY intricate storyline I've ever seen, everyone's talking about how this paved a new path in the animation industry (which is absolutely true) but the actual storyline and plot twists had me on my toes. 100/10, my new favorite movie!❤️❤️❤️|, This movie from beginning to end was just a visual treat.

Spies in Disguise,Spies in Disguise | Official Trailer 2 [HD] | 20th Century FOX,9eY2W7uUkDE,7665581,124075,6564,"Will Smith should do voice acting more often same with Tom Holland. It's quite good. I love it.|, The fact that he checks his pants when he’s transforming is 👌|, That was hella amazing movie! Comedy, action, emotions, weirdo amazing work they have put alot of effort in this especially the scene where they were escaping by a car the animations at that scene was so cool and the end scene too|, I think Spies In Disguise would make a better franchise than Ice age. It’s a great movie as it makes the pigeon plot work both comedy wise and drama wise. Also the pigeon plot gives this movie a reason to be animated. One or two sequels should have further missions with Lance and Walter and should have more hilarious plot devices. In the end you have an animated spy franchise that balances comedy and drama through fun elements of western animation.

And yes the studio has been shut down so that didn’t happen. Hopefully Disney will make a GOOD sequel to this movie. Will Smith and Tom Holland definitely deserve a franchise.|, After his hand shrank, the first thing he checks after drinking it is inside his pants 😂😂😂|, Walter Beckett and Lance Sterling are opposites I can both relate with on some level.

In terms of Walter, I was often lacking social skills, and one of the most intelligent members of my family (if not the most).  I also loved video games, movies (mainly science fiction, horror, animation, fantasy), literature, psychology, demonology, religion, zoology, and other things to a degree no one else I knew did, and graduated from college cum laude.

In terms of Lance Sterling, I wound being more popular than I realized, since in my last year of high school, I entered as a prom king contestant and voted for myself just for the heck of it, but I never expected that I ended up winning.|, dont you have to be worlds WORST spy, if everyone knows your name??|, I think the fact that everyone knows and he's a spy and they still can't stop him is impressive.|, “Technically you birded yourself”
This has the same energy as
“And this suit is amazing so technically it’s your fault”|, This movie is so underrated. It’s absolutely amazing and hilarious, u should def watch it"

If you get scared watching this trailer, don't. This movie is awesome and not quite as frightening as this video suggests.|, 9 out of my 11 personalities loved this film!|, James McAvoy deserves an Oscar. His acting where he turns from Barry to Dennis is phenomenal. Quite superb, I had to rewind that part just to appreciate how perfect his acting skills were|, I watched it today and this movie is truly a masterpiece! It sends a deep message to society and makes you think about some issues that we often neglect.|, I underestimated this movie..... This was truly freaking good|, I'm still surprised how James McAvoy transitioned to the different phases of personalities. I'm truly blown away.

One of the top movies of the decade.  (My apologies to anyone who went into it thinking they would get a fun summer-ey Selena Gomez movie.)|, I watched this when I was 10 because I thought it was some cutesy teen drama and I haven't been the same since|, Basically this is an alternate universe that shows what would’ve happened if Alex lost the wizard competition.|, Awesome film.

Sputnik,Sputnik Trailer #1 (2020) | Movieclips Trailers,oGgtRsvq6hc,1595673,16186,931,"Just finished watching this film and highly recommend it. Turn the volume up. The score to this film is really beautiful; reminding me of Jurassic Park or Jaws, with deep tones to signify terror and anticipation of what’s to come. It’s too bad they couldn’t do a theatrical release, with obviously everything going on with the pandemic. But it’s definitely worth the watch. It’s not your typical shoot em up style film so don’t expect a film like Alien (which I loved). But it’s also not as tame as Arrival (which I loved). It offers some original ideas as well as homages inspiration from former Alien Themed horror sci fi flicks (to be expected, as that is the genre). But what I really enjoyed about this film was the human aspect and the themes of the film. If it’s music that will make the people come together, it’s film that allows people from different backgrounds to appreciate art from a different culture and historical perspective. This movie deserves attention during the award circuit. Be it art from South Korea with Parasite and Old Boy, this film from Russia, City of God from Brazil to the silvery littered pavements of Hollywood; art and film making can transport you into another place but at the end we’re all individuals of the human experience trying to make some sense of this life. Open your minds; Read the Subtitles. This movie is worth the watch. Reminder, turn the volume up. Also, it may not come off that deep but I’m just generous with my comments that no ones asking for haha|, I watched this movie last night and it was a thorough entertainer. Well written, well directed and edge of the seat thriller. 9/10|, Did not expect it to be as good as it turned out to be. Would recommend it to my sci-fi loving friends who don't mind subtitles.|, This actually looks pretty good, Almost like  Russian version of Alien.|, Saw this when it came out. Best indie sci-fi horror ever made. Puts a lot of Hollywood films to shame. Has the suspense of the original alien. 

But that sound when she first sees the alien is a masterpiece, utterly spine chilling sound. The sound is easily the best part of the film.

Pace and acting is good. Special effects are superb for a low budget movie too, Hollywood would’ve spent millions of the special effects and they’d be nowhere near as good. One of the best low budget movies I’ve ever seen.|, Most of the critics doesnt appreciate this movie. One of my favorite alien film out there. The plot is very unique, uncommon film.|, just finished  watching the movie,. it was  better than I expected, definitely worth my time.... The lead actress also did great.|, Okay this looks really good. It feels like a whole load of previous movies that have been carefully stitched together to create a gentle balance. Will definitely have to check this out.|, I love every IFC movie I watch so I'm sure I'll love this. I get happy when that initial IFC name pops up cause I know the movie doesn't automatically suck, my expeditions immediately rise.|, at first, I expect the typical alien/monster movie. but this movie beyond my expectation. great storyline, sound design and atmosphere"

I love that. Exposes such a toxic environment.|, I really love those tiny details, for instance the three women in the surgery room portraying the three monekys, speak no evil, hear no evil and see no evil. Well made Annie!|, As someone who grew up in Los Angeles, this song hits in such an incredible way. It’s surreal, terrifying in a way, it captures the vibe of existential dread and dystopic “flawless living” that is so prominent in LA. Driving down the 405 to this song and it really feels like it’s the city’s theme song. I love Annie so much.|, She incorporates the guitar well in a modern contemporary fashion; I'm digging it.|, Only St. Vincent could make ""winter"" sound like ""women"" and make such a cunning play of words and hearing|, [Verse 1]

Girls in cages playing their guitars
But how can I leave?
I just follow the hood of my car
In Los Ageless, the waves they never break
They build and build until you don't have no escape
But how can I leave?
I just follow my hood to the sea, go to sleep
 

[Chorus]
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their minds, too?
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their minds, too?

I'm a monster and you're my sacred cow
But I can keep running
No, I can keep on running

How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their minds, too?
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind?|, I love her guitar. One of the coolest new  guitar shapes in a long time.|, ""In Los Ageless, the waves they never break; They build and build until you don't have no escape"" is such great imagery that 4-5 years and I'm still thinking about it.|, I'll always love just how raw this song is.

And they could redeem themselves back to regular infantry units if they accomplished objectives. Penal air squadrons were tried too, but quickly proved to be worthless. In the air a coward-pilot can't be controlled or well motivated. The German Army also had penal units.|, Stalin had issued Order No. 227 on July 27th 1942 known as “Not one step backwards”. You may be wondering about the shooting deserters part of the battle. This happened on a small scale, but is mainly exaggerated by Hollywood.|, ""The Germans say they are willing to sacrifice anything to take this city, we will show them the meaning of sacrifice"" - unknown Soviet soldier.|, A German soldier in his diary documented ""We would enter the home, fight the reds and win the kitchen, but then my god we would find ourselves fighting the reds for the bedroom""|, Let's be real the only reason the Soviets won was Reznov and Dimitri|, When you realize that Stalingrad saw a greater loss of life than entire wars|, The fact that the city bore Stalin’s name was not the only reason the city had so much importance. At the time hitler wanted to control the Caucasus region to use the oil and other natural recourses to win the war.
The plan was to encircle the Caucasus, then move south to take the region, and Stalingrad was one city that needed to be taken over to complete the encirclement. The reason this region is so important is because Germany was running out of oil and the Caucasus could supply them with enough oil to win the war, plus that would mean even more farmland and resources taken away from the soviets.
Extra side note: I am not an expert at WW2 so feel free to criticize any inaccuracies in this comment|, Hello, I am from Russia! Thank you for not forgetting about Eastern front because it so offensively and painful to folks who lived in the USSR that Western World (I mean prime people living in the Western World) doesn't know about great battles likewise Stalingard and we had many of them, for example, Battle of Kursk, Siege of Leningrad, Battle of Moscow, Belorussian offensive (operation ""Bagration"")in June 1944, Battle for Ukraine (1943-1944), Battle of Berlin and many other offensive operations planned and realised by Red Army. But we remember your battles, for exmaple, Battle of El-Alamein, D-Day (1944) and your assistance at Pacific theatre of WWII. Good channel!|, Not so much of a fun fact: More germans died in the battle of Stalingrad, than on entire Western front. And some people still think that it were americans who played the most important role in the war with Germany. Actually, America's most valuable effort in that was that it supplied russians with food/boots/weaponry. Not saying that the western front wasn't a great deal, but still..."

Which means if this battle actually took place in in 2016 they would be blasting Bach and 12 Violin Sonatas, Op. 1 and I die laughing every time|, This was one of the most delightfully-unexpected and well-earned music cues I’ve seen in a blockbuster in a long while.

The fact it comes full-circle with ‘Sabotage’ played as Kirk is a child in the first 2009 Star Trek movie just makes it even more sublime.

Great call by Simon Pegg as a writer, great execution by Justin Lin as the director.|, This whole scene is an instant classic, but Chekhov and Sulu jammin' while navigating is the best for me|, I love the Kelvin timeline movies. I know alot of die-hard trekkies like to hate on it, but I really like them. Chris Pine plays a damn good Kirk too.|, Imagine being the guy in YorkTown who gets to press the broadcast button. Greatest moment in their lives|, This is the best scene in NuTrek.  First its fun and playful and internally it shows the enterprise thinking around and through a fight.

I remember finding this speech in the spring of 2008 when I was an exhange student in Stockholm. It struck me with so much force, and I remember showing it to my new exchange student friends who were equally inspired. Steve Jobs was putting into words the exact philosophy of life that we were all trying to connect with and have the courage to live out. Later that year during the summer break, a group of us went on a road trip in an old Volkswagen bus, from Stockholm to Bergen… We would be listening and singing along to Life is Wonderful by Jason Mraz over and over again. And I remember these moments during this trip where I felt so grateful just to be alive and singing with new friends, and feeling that hunger and foolishness, and wanting to never ever loose that. After  the Exchange program had ended, we would e-mail  each other to catch up and would end our conversations with those words: “stay hungry, stay foolish”. 
Thank you Steve Jobs for this wonderful wonderful speech which we took to heart during the summer of our lives. 
And a big shout out to my special Erasmus friends around the world! 
Stay hungry, stay foolish. 
Matias|, ""Don't waste it (your life), living someone else's life.""

I can't imagine how many patients aren't lucky enough to have a loving family, a supportive partner, a financial situation for treatment...|, I just watched this movie and up till now I still find myself crying. Alzheimer's disease is no joke. I remember when I was in nursing school how people with Alzheimer's disease were. I felt so bad because they did not have a choice and that there is no cure for it. I loved this movie!|, Honest to God, this is the disease that terrifies me the most... I mean, cancer is also terrifying and painful, but Alzheimer is being lost within yourself, losing everything that ties you to who you are|, I had such an emotional break down at the end of this movie, I was sobbing uncontrollably. Watching it with my mom probably didn't help but it really put into perspective the desperate feeling of not taking her or anyone in my life for granted, but especially her. Sad for all the times I wasn't in the moment and desperate for the ability to stay in the moment and appreciate her the way she deserves every day of my life moving forward. I regret so many days passing by that I didn't.|, I can't even watch the trailer for this movie without tearing up. I don't know anyone with Alzheimers but this movie really puts it into perspective. Great job to Julianne Moore, she deserved this Oscar.|, Was I the only one who cried like a little girl at the end of the movie? That last line just killed me.|, This was an inspirational film. It was hard witnessing how Alzheimer's effects a family and a person. Obviously she doesn't really have it, but it's hard to ""see"" how a person deteriorates over time until they are no longer themselves.|, What a heartbreaking disease. You don’t die, yet you are gone! How unbelievably sad! Julianne did an outstanding job 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻|, Really good film! My mother had this disease and its truly horrible, i watched my mum deteriorate from early signs to the later in 3 years. My beautiful mum passed away in december 2018 and even though i was heart broken and i think of her everyday, i believe she now is in a better place|, What a great cast.

And Matt Damon delivers a stellar performance as usual. Great film 🎥🍿❤️|, Matt Damon is an underrated actor! He can perform any role thrown at him!
It's just INCREDIBLE how well he blends in with all his characters|, Amazing movie. It's incredible how a simple man like the main character can have more value than all the snobbish lawyers and intellectuals who'd rather sweep injustice under the rug than do something that would potentially hurt their reputation or belief system.
Great movie.|, Just saw the film. Little different then what I was expecting from the trailer, but in a good way. I must applaud the researchers, because this is one of the most realistic and factually accurate films I've ever seen. And so much dept in the plot and characters' relationships. 

The only gaffe I noticed is that Bill stated that he owns two guns, but if he wasn't allowed to vote because of a criminal record, he wouldn't be allowed to own a gun either. 

But other than that, it's very realistic and accurate.|, Love this movie .
We need more of it 
Not some heroic teenager crap
We need real life movies|, After the Bourne series, I forgot how good of an actor Matt Damon without the fight scenes is until watching this movie. I hope they make more movies like this. No CGIs, only life story, connections among the characters, especially between Bill and Maya. Beautifully directed and casted.|, Não assisti ainda, mas só por ter o Matt Damon sei que é perfeito.|, Enjoyed the movie a lot. Great human connection elements mixed in with bad character decisions that make you cringe. Movie plays with your emotions really well.|, Just watched the movie, expecting for the crime story and the action, but end up with emotional train which is much better. Its a deep and thoughtful movie with an ironic twist. The movie is a little bit slow but it makes the story more 'real'. Good movie, thumbs up"

Sometimes you need to do something bad to stop you from doing something worse.|, This movie is perfection - a poetic, twisted, extended psycho sexual orgasm of cinematic delight. Wonderful acting from all.  Mia Wasikowska is hypnotic, totally compelling.|, South Korean directors are so good in making crime/murder/mystery thrillers. Stoker gave me chills, (even with the shallow script but Park Chan-Wok, the actors and the rest of the production crew did an amazing job in elevating the film) the chills I got from watching a Hitchcock film (as it was a quasi-remake of a Hitch film) ---  And that is a MASSIVE thing to say.|, Just watched this and it was excellent! Reminded me of one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films, Shadow of a Doubt, which is also about a serial killer named Uncle Charlie who's obsessed with his teenage niece. Apparently this movie is an homage to it.
Great film, and Matthew Goode is excellent as always. He deserves more recognition.|, A brilliantly crafted film. It's unique sound and visual techniques really captured the essence of this gothic, erotic psychological thriller. Kudos to the director and cast for creating such a spellbinding film. 

P.S. It's not only John Wick who's deadly with a pencil.|, Just watched it. WOW that's all i can say. This movie had my emotions all mixed up, i didn't know wether i was 'coming' or going. I was aroused, turnoff, disgusted and pleased all at the same time. I LOVE IT. This is what drama's are all about. Damn!😥|, Turns 10 today!
I remember watching it once 
it's unflinching and almost has a Freudian quality 
This plays like a Hitchcock thriller 
There's plenty of beautifully filmed portions involving transitions that are seamless, plenty of symbolism making it a cerebral experience 
The craftsmanship alone is enough to give this a viewing 
Some things are screwed up behind repair, we wipe the slate clean, others can succeed where we have failed, having children for some is to have carbon copies to get it right 
Some shortcomings keep it from truly excelling like a few hints of backstory that aren't all that explored and the script could use more depth with better pacing 
But the director explores many of these peoples dark perversions woven into a psychological drama that's subtle|, I watched the trailer and went and watched it. And omg! How did I not hear about this before?! Matthew Goode was amazing. Fantastic movie. When the credits rolled, I literally said ""Wow ""|, Park Chan Wook is a master of his craft,  his use of colour in this film was incredible.  Every movie he does is stunning.|, This movie is amazing. It keeps your imagination exploring. I personally hate movies because most of them are boring but this one, it's amazing. "

PREACH 👏|, We will never know who threw the first brick. What we do know by everyone's account is that Marsha and Sylvia gave their lives fighting for LGBT+ rights. That's more than enough to celebrate them and to be thankful for their sacrifice.|, ""if people start telling stories not as they were, but as they would like them to be, that procedure can be used by anyone for any purpose."" 

Amazing|, The man in pick glasses realizing 50 years after the fact that the song follows the toon of It's Howdy Doody time is my favorite part|, I’m just glad that stonewall happened, no matter what the actual story was. Just to see how far this community has come is amazing.|, i really appreciate this video's attention to detail. it's always disheartening to see Stormé get swept under the rug when it comes to stonewall.|, The amount of misconceptions when it comes to historical events like Stonewall is honestly not surprising. But the fact is this: regardless of who threw the first brick (metaphorically, of course) the LGBTQ+ community should be grateful to ALL who stood with the movement and recognize credit where credit is due. Marsha and Sylvia may not have started Stonewall, but they made their own contributions to the community. If Storme truly was the one to start it all, then of course she deserves recognition. If not, she still defended lesbian bars not long after Stonewall happened. 

The point is they ALL contributed something, and there's no denying that.|, Gay by Birth. Proud by Choice.

I think that scene where the Hugo Weaving explains his wife and kids running away may explain why the movie ended that way. Very very sad, but apart from the great acting from Weaving, Kidman and of course Fiennes, how this story unfolded portraying effects within a family in turmoil undergoing grief, guilt, pride, victim playing, shaming one another, regret, etc - this movie is quite a work of art.|, Saw this movie yesterday. Nicole Kidman is a force of nature. She is deserving of an award that has not been created yet, void of politics. Joseph Fiennes who plays her husband also is great. The plot lingers and Maddison Brown really didn't get a chance to shine, and to not let a star shine should be criminal.|, I'm really excited to see Maddison Brown in it! She looks great in the trailer, think she could go far|, Nicole always shines in these kind of movies|, Can't wait for this movie :D|, Buena si buscas una película de suspenso, pero debió tener un final mas sorprendente.

The theatre was packed (because of national cinema day) and all of us kept laughing 😂 And the dogs are so cute. Great movie I loved it, perfect for a good laugh.

In real life they were actually singing praises of sully from the get go and the invesgitation was a cordial, with full cooperation from both sides. Like for fucks sake these people probably knew better than anyone including pilots, how amazing it was what sully pulled off at the time. Ultimately I still rewatch part of the crash sequence from time to time, but I usually stop after that.|, “No one warned us” gives me chills every time because of the way he says it.|, As an airline employee I totally applaud & appreciate this touching movie.

Donovan was good friends with The Beatles and they were both making very innovative and trippy music at the time. 
Donovan's producer Mickie Most told him not to play this to Paul McCartney under any circumstances, because he knew McCartney would be tempted to do something similar.|, This track arranged by John Cameron with electric bass by John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page on electric guitar…gave it that extra special magic!|, His music got me through bad trips and panic attacks|, Donovan defined his own niche in music and poetry.  Well done.|, Timeless treasure|, We cannot underestimate how crucial Donovan's influence continues to be. E.g. His influence on the Beatles' songwriting via chordal progression & finger-picking on 'The White Album', was profound. He also made it cool to mix instruments from various cultures or epochs. Then there is the spiritual progressiveness, another intercultural border crossing. A brilliant soul. He is an honorary guest at Faerieworlds Live From Home 21-23 August 2020. True to style, he inspires generations of troubadours who still greet the world with wonder."

I won't give any spoilers away, but it's an important movie that shows how we need to be alert of early signs from especially teenagers, that can be a potential threat to the rest of us, without even knowing it. Visually stunning, cinematography on point, storyline grabs you from the first second, the cast are acting as if they were adults, a joy to watch. Don't be fooled by people saying it was a bad movie, they probably have all the Fast and Furious movies in their collection anyway. Kevin Phillips, congratulations! Wauw.|, This is one of those times no pun intended , when a film leaves you speechless. It was really something different, haunting and unique made with familiar elements but with added element containing deep and dark corners of human psychology. Film is kinda personal journey of fighting with internal demons, living a life with sense of emptiness and despair, but trying to make sense out of it. Well acted , sharply written and inovative with its approach this is a must see for film lovers.|, The music, the scenery, the dialogue. Everything about this movie is a masterpiece.|, This trailer actually does justice for the movie, building suspense and not revealing anything properly to the audience.

Absolutely brilliant--filming was eerie and beautiful, captured the mood so well. Highly recommended!|, This is an incredible film.

Not often does a movie's sequel years later do well overall, but I feel this is the one to do it. Super Troopers have the following, and it looks like they stayed true to their style without being too over the top or too similar to their first movie which made them successful. That being said this is only a trailer, but I feel like we're in for a good show. Enjoy, all !|, Finally, a movie that deserved a sequel.|, What some people may not know about ST2 is that it was completely fan funded and if the movie makes enough at the box office, they'll have enough to make pot fest.|, Holy crap this is so funny!

Suspiria,Suspiria - Official Trailer | Amazon Studios,BY6QKRl56Ok,13268030,46552,3369,"THIS is how you do a remake. Go in a completely different stylistic direction than the original film to give yours its own identity, yet keep the general unsettling atmosphere that made said original film work so well. On top of that, expand upon the characters and world in a way that works and - there you go! A remake that not only stands on its own, but is worthy of being placed alongside the film it’s based on.|, A masterpiece. This definitely deserved way more recognition. The color palette, the acting, the sets, the score just EVERYTHING, gorgeous movie. The fact that it didn’t get no awards is absolutely heartbreaking. I mean that ending sequence is pure art. I can’t, I’m baffled.|, this was an absolute masterpiece, especially for the horror genre. I felt like I was under hypnosis the entire time, it was like I was being forced to watch something I wasn't supposed to watch. I was enthralled by every scene, every detail, every shot every sound every visual. There were scenes where I literally couldn't breathe, and I was just staring at the screen. A horror movie hasn't made me feel like that in a long time. Definitely worth the watch.|, This movie is too beautiful to scare me, it was pure art.|, I loved this film so much. I don't understand the hate people had for it. This is the kind of horror I want. Dread that builds, not over the top popcorn horror that is most of the horror genre.|, Finally, they're taking horror seriously again. And this looks like the culmination of epicness. Can't wait!|, It's horror films like this that prove the genre deserves its own category at the Oscars.|, I've just seen this movie and... it's the most disturbing, intense, yet the most beautiful cinematic experience in recent years! Just like the original, Suspiria 2018 to me is a masterpiece, but in a totally different way. All the love its creators had for Argento's classic, was poured into creating something unique that stands on its own. It will sure divide the audiences, but to me it was a breathtaking experience.|, What I love most about this trailer is that, even being a remake, it feels like the original Suspiria. a remake is supposed to capture the essence of the original movie and renew it, and this does it perfectly|, I love this movie so much and I love how it doesn't just remake the original, the whole second half of the movie is a different take inspired by the original and I really love that. Also Tilda was robbed of an oscar"

This looks amazing can't wait 😍|, Just saw this yesterday. While I think Your Name is still Makoto Shinkai's best writing, I believe Suzume is his best work as a director to date. The colors and shot composition in Suzume are amazing. The whole thing is wonderfully cinematic. Another aspect in which Suzume surpasses his other films is the humor. There's so much genuine humor to soak up. I was worried the whole ""living chair"" thing would come across as too LOL RANDOM, but it's done masterfully.|, After watching Garden of Words and Your Name, I fell in love with this director’s works and have been on top of his movies ever since. I seriously can’t wait until this comes out in theaters! Thank you for all the beautiful things you create Makoto Shinkai, I CAN’T WAIT!!!|, I’m 30 yo male. I usually never cry watching movies but this one has touched my soul. I cried 3 times. Beautiful animations, terrific story, music and everything about it. I’m glad I was watching with English subs and original soundtrack|, This song already feels nostalgic. Imagine how nostalgic this would be after a couple of years.|, Beautiful song. It creates a whole mood for the trailer, somewhat whimsical yet somber. Which makes it beautiful, but also seems like it would be heartbreaking. If the film creates the same mood I feel like it's gonna be a rollercoaster ride. On my calendar!|, the movie looks hella beautiful and now im even more excited to watch it in April when it comes out... whether that's alone or with a friend"

When spud thinks back with slow slippy playing it bought me to tears. A tearful smile id say.|, When I was a teenager, my mom introduced me to the first film.

One of the best trailers ever made. Choose life.|, Unpopular opinion :
One of the best sequels ever|, This trailer just hits so perfectly. That needle drop to “Silk” by Wolf Alice, incredible. Great trailer for a film that initially disappointed me because it wasn’t Trainspotting, but grew on me with every subsequent viewing. This is a great movie!|, spud drawing in the air was beyond beautiful. I've always appreciated Danny Boyle as his films often depict social outcasts, igniting these individuals with intelligence and courage. Spud becoming the centre character as the film progressed symbolises this I believe. What a great film T2 Trainspotting is.|, Such a self-aware sequel. Really is worth the hype and is truly great at capturing that high of watching the first film. About as good, too. This trailer always stuck out in my mind as a great highlight reel. This and Blade Runner 2049 are the best long-awaited sequels of all time, hands down, no contest.

It is not that much cliché of a movie most of you guys think. Give it a chance. <3|, I watched this movie because the last scene shown in the trailer cracked me up (""How long have you worked here?"") but it turned out to be so much better then I expected. Unlike most movie trailers, this one didn't reveal any of the twists or the ending, but I'll just say this- this movie is so heartwarming and the ragtag group at table 19 stayed with me long after the movie ended.|, I really freakin loved this movie. Not normally into cliché romcoms but this was something else. It was really funny, really poignant at times and Anna Kendrick is just an absolute delight. Wish the movie had gotten more press.|, I loved this movie. The characters were brilliantly written. And the story is simple but beautiful and wholesome. It's surprisingly really good. I would recommend it.

My favorite character was the guy who was in prison. I forgot his name since I've watched this years ago. Lol.

I laughed so hard cried my eyes dry it was wonderful|, I just finished watching this movie on Cinemax and I REALLY enjoyed it.  I loved that the director was making you think one thing and then it wasn't that at all.  Great little twist.  I laughed a lot and at the end  I had a lump in my throat and a little tear in my eye, in a good way.  It was a sweet movie.  Watch it, you will enjoy it.|, such a good movie. did not expect where it was going thats why it was great. Plus the cast, that were so compleatly different from each other worked beautifully"

Usually they're obviously around like 16-19 year olds personality wise but these guys feel like they are fresh out of 6th grade.|, The best part about this movie is that for once the turtles are played by actual teenage boys the fact that they are means that this movie is going to be even more epic|, Ice cube being the villain is actually a refreshing twist and im ALL for it! Super excited for August!|, I actually watched this to the end and just wanna say that it should TOTALLY be a series. Make it happen nickelodeon!🤩|, This looks like the Spiderverse of TMNT, and I'm all for that! So excited to see this movie. I'm not even a big Ninja Turtles fan, but this just looks like a fun time to me|, This is honestly everything I've wanted in a TMNT movie, solid animation, fun plot and well written characters, I can't wait to see it in theaters!|, Cant wait to see angry Raphael on big screen !!! #Hyped ❤❤|, The animation style on this movie feels so special and the voice casting is pure gold. Can't wait to see it <3|, It’s honestly refreshing to see Baxter Stockman appearing in a TMNT movie, since most TMNT Films have mostly used The Shredder and The Foot Clan, and they don’t always execute them in the best way, I’m sure if the movie succeeds, it will lead to a franchise, as a long time Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan, I’m genuinely excited."

Love from 🇧🇩|, AMAZING FILM 😍❤|, This film is perfect👌🏻|, I would say they should make a US or France version of taboo but not only is their degeneracy already out in the open, it's praised and heavily encouraged by the majority of their extremely depraved society, meanwhile this does not represent Iranian society whatsoever and might only be found by a small underbelly of Tehran. Imagine being mad at Iranians not wanting this garbage to be made and shown in their country. Glad it's banned and whoever made it should stay in the west where their society love this kind of stuff.|, This movie is also too deep for someone from the west, the target group is the People of the Middle East (especially Iran, since it's about Iran) , to educate about what is going on in their countries, in the shadow sides of the country , issues that are being kept silent. It's a part of Iran that is very deep inside, a person from the west should educate themself about iran generally first before getting deep into iran and it's society issues in the undergrounds of the city. Again this movie doesn't represent Tehran, it represents the hidden part of Tehran, which is small, but bigger than most Iranians think|, 这部电影只是站在西方的角度去揣摩伊朗，那我说为什么叙利亚人坐在家里就有导弹落在头上一样，说你有大规模杀伤性武器就得有。这跟吊死有什么区别？西方的所谓自由是生存权在我手里，任何时候都可以有任何理由剥夺别人的生存权利！再有，那个黑中国的情节有点过分，我们不是要求处女，我们要求的是双方的忠诚。夫妻之前彼此忠诚于对方就行，谁会刻意要求处男处女？请不要把西方的滥交传播在东方的土地上！再说人文，是不是有异于西方的文化传承、思维方式、政治体制都被西方文明视为异类？这才是真正的不文明！一个先进的文明应该是博采众长，尊重不同的语言、文化、肤色等等，而不是戴着有色眼镜以自己固有的思维方式去揣测！|, Excellent movie!|, ""A film so controversial even the filmmaker's future grandchild is going to be serving time.""

Tenet: So confusing people need to see it twice|, I feel like no one can replace Chadwick as black panther but I wouldn’t mind John David Washington taking the role. He definitely has the characteristics.|, This movie is really soooo good. If you like Inception you will also like Tenet. The ending gave me chills. The action packed scenes and theatrics were perfect. There wasn't a strong development between the characters because of how fast paced the movie was but there was some development between the characters so it was satisfying for that part. Freaking awesome all around. FIY I've watched it twice and learned something new the second time around. Love it!|, People weren't ready for this masterpiece. It's way ahead of  it's time.

This movie will age very well.|, I remember, all were criticising this film just because of its complex plot, and confusing 1st half, but if you start understanding it, you'll find 1st half more interesting than 2nd one, and 2nd one is a cinematic masterpiece|, When your resume is so good that you don't even include interstellar|, Inception: Ending left to your own interpretation

This movie seems endearing so I can't wait to give it a watch.|, I want to watch this movie just because Of Hailee ☺️💖|, Enjoyed this a lot more than I thought, quite a large number of frecognizable faces in the cast, all of them did well. No awards and no fanfare, but was a better than average film 5/10|, I'm starting to like Vince Vaughn as an actor more and more since True Detective,I love his ""serious"" roles."

Logically, I know I'm looking at a digitally re-created face of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but the way the lips move, the skin glistens under the light, and even his hair still amazes me. The team who worked on this deserve major kudos for such a good job.|, Without realizing it, pops destroying this T-800 prevented the deaths of, LT Traxler, the two unknown Sarah Connor’s, the shooting range seller, multiple police officers, that one truck driver and even the punks themselves 😂|, The fact that the producers of this film didn't even take the trouble of having the punks actually dress like they did in the original movie says a lot.|, You gotta admit the cgi on young arnold is incredible|, Imagine having years to plan this very moment, and all you bring is a shotgun and an unloaded sniper rifle|, And that was literally the best scene of the entire film.|, When Arnold fights Arnold but Arnold is too strong for Arnold to the point where Arnold actually stars struggling so Arnold then needs some help from Sarah to kill Arnold and then Arnold looks at Arnold as Arnold dies, Arnold finally gets up, victorious from his battle with Arnold. Tbh I really wanted Arnold to win|, 1:49

Honestly while this movie may have issues, this moment always just gets to me. Just the way that the T-800 gets it’s power core blown clean through like that is just really satisfying to me."

Mind-blowing creation and especially, the part where Arnold Schwarzenegger steps in it wipes out the memory prior to that point in time! I'm in deep love with the franchise.|, I love the second like everyone else but there’s something about Dark Fate that really gets me, I actually really enjoy the movie. Sarah Conner is more badass than ever, I love that she’s so blunt and brave in this - anything but a victim. In a lot of ways she reminds me of S weaver in Alien|, I feel like I can appreciate Terminator 3 more after watching Dark Fate.|, Me fascina esta zaga por sus extraordinarios efectos especiales combinados con las extraordinarias
 actuaciones de Linda y Arnold que son mi atracción principal.El director James Camerum hizo un gran trabajo,desde el impactante fondo musical, escenas de acción y alucinantes efectos especiales, es lo que me emociona.Esto opaca la carencia de buen libreto.|, I still remember going to see Terminator 2 Judgement Day in the movie theater on its opening day back in the summer of 1991, the lineup stretched around the block and all showtimes were sold out.  The special effects in T2 were amazing back then, there was nothing else like it at the time and this was all before CGI.  It was the perfect movie, great storyline, cast, visual effects, soundtrack, it had it all.  I'll never forget the experience and feeling it left in me seeing it in the movie theaters for the first time.  Seeing Arnold and Linda back together again brings back a lot of great memories, but you can't re-create the perfection of the past or catch the same lightning in bottle again.  These are different times now that we live in, and not for the better.  Sorry but Dark Fate is no T2 Judgement Day.|, I love this sequences. But it all doesn't always go the way I expect. The fighting looks so real. Awesome.|, I was so happy to see such a great movie! Especially because I didn't know time was passing because of the acting and action of the leading actors. I've already seen it five times before because I couldn't forget the powerful impact I had when I first saw I don't understand why I swear at this wonderful movie. I don't know if you're talking to me or watching a movie. If the sequel is confirmed within a few years, I think I can wait in a few years!|, Terminator 1 awesome, Terminator 2 Amazing.  That’s all"
Terrifier,Terrifier | Full Movie | Full HD | Slasher Action Horror | Art The Clown!,2Yxanyc2QO8,1847873,15918,1154,"I love how unconventional this movie is. The slasher villain whips out a gun, we switch main characters halfway through the movie, the first kill isn’t even by the main villain, and Art isn’t defeated but instead fakes a suicide.|, You ever notice in horror movies time and time again they get the bad guy knocked down or unconscious but then instead of finishing him off they just wonder off to go hide somewhere until he wakes up? Pro tip kids when you get the drop on someone don't hesitate.|, The Terrifier films may be low budget, but they have so much love put into them and you can tell that they were made by people who just love movies. Especially horror movies.|, I like how the crazy lady becomes sane after she sees a murder. She is cured now. This clown is a genius.|, I first saw this in theatres while on magic mushrooms and It was the most intense unnerving uncomfortable disgusting experience I’ve ever gone through, thought it would’ve been cheesy but it was just out right gross, wanted to leave the whole time but I was so shocked I couldn’t move 😂|, When Tara's sister stabs Art in the foot and as she runs away Art just flips her off 🤣 plus when he starts sucking his thumb when the lady found him and the tricycle scene. Classic. 

Also can we just talk about how silent Art is? He snuck up on people with ease. It just adds to the suspense of it all. Really digs into the phycological horror.|, Great film! For anyone wondering - YES - this version right here is edited and you will NOT see the unrated gore of the uncut masterpiece here. It doesn't say so anywhere but I've seen it plenty enough times to have noticed the differences in the pizza shop scene almost immediately.|, Great writing, great acting, a terror classic!  I can not wait to see Terrifier Two.|, Great movie!! The actors are fantastic!! I love it!!|, I love the rough-around-the-edges style the Terrifier movies have. I guess it's a given because of the low budget, but I wish more movies could feel this much like a passion project that got out of hand 😅"

It was an incredible experience to be alongside such passionate performers and creative legends like Damien and the crew.|, Oh my gosh when I saw Leah actually in your studio I just about lost it, it brought me so much joy!!! So cool that she came by to do that!!!|, as much as it sucks that you have to censor the kills this much, it's kind of good for people like me who physically cannot handle gore of this caliber, because i still want to be able to appreciate what goes into a movie like this.  these videos often give me a new level of respect and appreciation for the movies you cover, so it's nice that i'm actually able to handle it in this context|, allie’s death was seriously the grossest and most painful kill i’ve ever seen. i was literally watching t2 in class and my friends were looking over at me and seeing my eyes widen in shock. it was great|, You can tell that he genuinely is one of the people who wants to make all the good gore accessible to everyone but still has to play by YouTube rules and even has it accessible for as low as $1. We love you James|, I met the actress for Allie at a con and she talked about how the makeup process for the bedroom scene had to be done in installments one after the other because of how long the scene lasted and all the crazy stuff Art did.

Thank You for Your Service,Thank You for Your Service Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Trailers,50LQGcb5knE,4050650,37693,2140,"Not gonna lie, I got teary eyed when I saw her look at the line ""I feel like I can't go on"" and then she looked out in the yard and saw him going through life normally. The things we hide, man.|, I've watched the trailer hundreds of times and seen the movie twice and when I hear the line (he did his job now it's time too do your's) I still get chills|, I'm going to comment on this as the daughter of a Veteran. My father has PTSD, and as for the last few years since certain deployments. It does not matter how long it has been, it is evident that there are still moments for him, and I'm absolutely certain that this applies to anyone who has been in combat in extreme conditions, and even for those who have not been. I grew up surrounded by soldiers and being friends with other kids who mom, dad, or both, had PTSD. It is a REAL thing, and I am very impressed and thankful that this film was made. I think that it is important to realize that this movie (from what I gather from the trailer) touches on the aspects of home life, relationships, work, friends, the whole 9 yards. I know that there have been some complaints in regard to casting, but honestly I believe that Miles Teller is a fantastic talent. If you had the chance to see 'Bleed For This', I think he really had an exceptional performance and that we will only see greater things from him. I'm not sure who Amy Schumer plays, but I'm just hoping that she is in a more serious platform that is believable. I see comments talking about how this is 'propaganda' and 'killing innocents', but you have to realize that when you are in the military, you are serving THIS COUNTRY, AMERICA. You are representing this country, and when you are in war you have to realize that sometimes the most rational decisions are not always made (not that it justifies anything) and that you are under orders of the United States Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy, or whatever branch it may be. This movie is from the perspective of soldiers that had to do all of that. Above all, they have to protect themselves as well as their fellow soldiers. Being in a position of a soldier is one that is emotionally exhausting and physically demanding, that can not be disregarded. Have we seen them make stupid mistakes before? Yes. Have they represented this country terribly at times? Yes. But this movie is about those who made the ones who chose under oath to serve this country, and represent it with full bravery. Not all soldiers are the same, they are NOT. This movie seems to reflect the true ideal of a soldier, to fight for this country, to protect it and it's citizens.|, My dad is a army veteran 2014 he was diagnosed with ptsd. This brings everything into light about what he has been through from Vietnam all the way to Afghanistan. I know I will never fully understand what he goes through on a daily basis but this movie has made me see what it’s like through his eyes.|, I recently saw this movie last week. It is based from a true story by the soldiers that were in that unit. When I say this movie is real. I mean it, they go to the darkest corners of what these soldiers went through. Through out the whole movie, I think only one or two people said 'thank you'. I started thinking....you know maybe the reason why people in this movie don't say thank you, could be because, when WE the viewer watch and realize what veterans go through when they return home, we can understand a small portion of what they went through, and knowing that we can say, truly say and understand WHY we are saying thank you. I have friends/ family in every branch of the military and I say this countless times when ever I see my friends/ family who served or a veteran, thank you. Because I might not know what they went through over there, I do know that what they did was important.|, This is a masterpiece of a movie! However, I highly advise you not to watch it if you're going through some rough times. For me the experience was awful, worse than a horror movie. I felt like I was watching some psychological horror. The whole movie is just depressing. Now, I don't mean the movie was bad, I just think that it delivered it's message and it did it perfectly! Now I need some time off... to... you know, get back on track|, im stoked for this movie. I dont have any friends or relatives serving, but i know how much we all take for granted for all those thousands of men and  women who put their lives on the in service for their country.|, “I’m not a hero, we’re brothers we look after each other” so real, so true and so powerful only a few will understand.|, One of the most well put together film trailers I have seen in a long time.|, I never cried so much… one small move can impact everyone’s lives…. 10/10 and this is true events thanks for your service !😊"

He portrayed pain and troubles of his character in such a powerful way.|, I just watched this movie.. Wow. Deep. Little comedy but wow it is really emotional and shows the real struggle folks deal with.
Great meaningful movie. Kudos.|, Wow 7 years ago... I remember when this trailer dropped on YouTube. I was preparing to go meetup with my group from class to prep for our presentation. I remember looking forward to seeing this movie. Life was simpler, but life also had its different difficulties. Anyway, the movie was okay. It has its good moments but also some pretty stale moments too. It's somewhere between 3 and 3.5 out of 5.|, This is such a fantastic cast|, This movie is so underrated. It’s amazing!|, Everyone at the SAA meeting is married! That was my first surprise. Their spouse loves them so much they are in support group. And a lot of people there have masturbation addiction mainly. I went there and I was the only female. The female support group is very rare and far away from me. But everyone was so welcoming. If you are a newcomer they skip their meeting and they spend the whole time introducing themselves. It was so beautiful. I was a virgin but one day all of my beliefs and values were shattered and I lost everything and ended up with 40 partners in 2 months. I felt powerful that men gave me whatever i wanted if I were willing to behave a certain way  when my whole life I had felt insecure. My doctors thought I was being trafficked. Finally my friends forced me into therapy. My life is so much better now. It can happen to anyone.|, She has been with Iron man and Hulk. She is really making her way through the team|, I was surprised of how good was Pinks acting, wonder why she didnt got more gigs.|, This was a fabulous movie.|, Great movie! My personal favorit was the friendship between Dede (Pink) and Neil (Josh Gad)."
Thanksgiving,THANKSGIVING - Official Trailer (HD),KbU50SdL8zA,22037174,56008,4478,"the idea of each kill being themed around it's own thanksgiving dinner appliance is honestly so creative|, This looks fantastic. And what I love is that it seems to take itself seriously- meaning it's just the right level of camp without being absurd or trying to be a comedy. Too many slashers are comedic these days, but I love how violent, dark and nasty this one is.|, Amazing movie! Took myself on a date twice to see it last week and I was left smiling each time. Eli completely captured 80s and 90s camp horror and made it his own. Definitely a cult classic horror. Hopefully there will be a trilogy franchise because a movie each “thanksgiving” (I’m Native American, we call it turkey day) would be epic 😩🥹|, Saw it yesterday and it’s one of the best, most original horror/slasher movies I’ve seen in a long time. It had me completely invested from start to finish with no dull moments really. It’s a really intense movie that you should unquestionably see in the theatre. I didn’t watch any trailers or read any reviews before watching the movie, so I didn’t really know what to expect. It’s not often that I give a movie full stars but this one gets a  5/5 ⭐️ rating from me.|, Excellent trailer that really keeps your attention.  My only concern is that it, like many other horror movie trailers, show too much.  The scene where the killer uses the water and fridge door is super creative, I wish I could have seen that for the first time in theaters.|, Just got out of the theater. This movie was excellent. No filler and some of the ways the characters were killed off were absolutely brutal. Very unexpected ending. I totally recommend.|, Potential is off the charts.  If youre an old timer like me, you remember growing up with horror movies coming out on VHS based on every holiday possible, and this oozes that same nostaligic vibe.  The cinematography looks spot on and I'm already in 100%.|, I haven't been this stoked for a movie in a long, long time! Never thought this would happen, and it's almost here.... can't wait.|, If you love horror like I do and nothing nowadays seems to scare you in that amazingly fantastic way you love to be scared, watch this movie!! I just saw it and I've never felt the impulse to walk out on a horror movie within the first five minutes because it was THAT kind of horrifying before Thanksgiving.|, Saw it last night with some friends and it was really fun with so many great kill scenes. It made me want a future Final Destination movie to be directed by Eli Roth. Could you imagine the death sequences in that!"

When will I get a break!|, Considering that Fuze made the story, I am just beyond thrilled at the idea of getting more of the Onis and their history as ogres. The fact that Benimaru and Shuna had a big brother is so intriguing to me. When was he named ? Was he here for the destruction of his village ? Did he escape thunking himself the last survivor ? Was he the successor as the king of ogres ?

The 15:17 to Paris,THE 15:17 TO PARIS - Official Trailer [HD],IC_lnyn2R2Q,6125557,23674,2368,"This was a very inspiring  movie. The backstory was very important to Spencer's story. What he felt as failure in those areas that he was interested in serving in the military, trained him to do this unexpected mission. Thank you all for you your service, true patriots.|, This is actually quite unique. Getting the actual Heroes of this true story to play themselves in the film. Clint Eastwood changing the game again.|, I would absolutely recommend watching this movie to  anyone! 
The fact that is made after true events and the actual people to whom this things had happened were the actual actors just make the movie 10 times better!10/10|, I loved this movie. Based on real events played by most of the actual people involved. It’s the opposite of a Hollywood movie with their fake cliches and social justice quotas. I like how they portrayed the military fairly accurately. Like how they taught military members to hide under a desk. That was what they actually taught. I think it’s taught slightly different today. Also not getting to be a pj because of depth perception, accurate! Lol sorry for laughing that’s true tho|, So cool to see that these three guys are getting the recognition they deserve. When this attack happened I was working at a Jamba Juice in Sacramento, the one that Spencer Stone worked at a few years before. He was still on good terms with my managers and came into the store on my day off which I was super bummed about. 
They all went out for drinks in downtown Sac and Spencer was stabbed by a man for defending one of my managers. Obviously he's all good. 
Just a cool little thing to know that I was only one person away from knowing this hero and his friends! Can't wait to see this film.|, I can't believe they're playing themselves. It takes guts and courage. Reenacting the real life experience they went through. But it all makes sense because they witnessed and experienced the whole attack and saved thousands of lives. I salute these heroes.|, 87years old and still make a movie every 2 years and best part is they're good..Clint Eastwood(Legend)|, Película realmente emocionante, no entiendo a todas esas personas que dicen que es una desilusión, basura y bla bla bla.. aquí se habla de un hecho qué pasó en la vida real, y me emociona ver esta película porque es interpretada por los mismo héroes! 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️|, My sister and I loved the movie and thank Clint Eastwood for using the real heroes! We had not been to see a movie since ""Sully."" This kind of heroism is what kids need to see, not the robots, vampires, machine guns, explosions, and car chases of violent fantasies. These three wonderful young men show the example that each of us CAN make a difference no matter what our background. They were not the smartest nor the best students growing up, but they had loving, Christian mothers who formed their inner cores. Clint Eastwood had the insight to see that he could not duplicate the bond that these three have by using actors. Well worth seeing this great tribute to real heroism.|, I think its SOOO amazing that Clint cast the real life heroes in this! And that he actually took on a real life hero story to film! Cannot wait to support this film when it comes out! You’ve got my attendance in that theatre chair, sir."

What the hell?|, I remember watching the live rescue operation of the miners back in 2010. I literally cried when the first one came out from tube. The others who came out were even excited they gave the Chilean President rocks as 'souvenirs' from underground. All of them were truly remarkable and their faith with God was strong. #LosMinerosDeChile|, eu e minha família torcemos muito por cada um desses chilenos e choramos juntos pois foi muito forte o que aconteceu.|, As a chilean i find the fact that this is a movie touching. I remember. I was around four years old. When we got home i wanted to watch playhouse disney and i turned on the TV. The news were on every channel
""THIRTY THREE MINERS, SAFE BROUGHT UP TO THE SURFACE!""
My mom rushed upstairs and we went out to the streets and everyone hugged and we all cried. We celebrated until we couldn't anymore and the whole street was filled with the chanting of the national anthem
""Puro chile es tu cielo azulado 
Puras brisas te cruzan también
Y tús campo de flores bordados 
Son la copia feliz del Eden
Majestuosa es la blanca montaña
Que te dio por valuarte el señor

Gosh it's terrible what they had to go through.  It makes me realize how much I take for granted .|, El punto del idioma de la película es un tema meramente comercial, es como la película ""Alive"" (viven!) de los uruguayos en la cordillera de los Andes. Al estar en ingles es más fácil comercializarla e internacionalizarla y hacerla llegar a mas cines alrededor del mundo es eso y punto. No deja de ser una historia ocurrida en Chile y parte fundamental de los corazones de cada chileno, para que decir de las familias de los mineros y los meros mismos. Yo soy productora chilena en México y a veces es difícil tomar ciertas decisiones para apoyar una historia y proyectarla en pantalla... Lo importante es hacerla llegar al público que quieres llegar, y no dejarla guardada en un cajón. Mis felicitaciones para la directora y producción de esta película :)"

I honestly look over the whole problem of the girl power aspect, and just enjoyed the action.

The 5th wave is my favorite book because it's wonderfully written and it's just full of feelings.

So far it’s not living up to what I was expecting based on this film.  Haven’t had to kill any assassins or stop giant conspiracies with multibillion dollar companies. A lot more excel work than I was hoping for|, Credit to the husband as well. He grabs the gun while in the car and manages to keep the bad guy occupied long enough for Christian to jump on.

The Addams Family 2. Because the first one did so well that there was no other choice but to make a sequel|, A family going on a road trip? Wow, this is genius!

Inevitably tragic but brilliant all the same.|, I was deeply impressed by Jason Clarke's acting. When he finally comes to terms with his son's death he gives an outstanding, deeply moving performance. I simply do not understand how he was able to play that scene so convincingly, so naturally. Not a movment, expression or word too much. It was breathtaking and a performance that I shall remember till I am dead. If anyone deserves an Oscar in that film then he does.|, Keira Knightley is one of the few actors and actresses that I will go to the cinema for. ( I knew nothing about the book before and without her in it, wouldn't have looked twice at this one either, but seeing her name on the movie has me hyped to see it.)
I haven't seen any bad acting by her so far and she picks great movies time and time again - I really respect her, she is intelligent, accomplished and has integrity. She is gorgeous inside and out.|, Kiera loves making these kind of movies. She deserves an Oscar|, It is a fantastic movie, set in the Post War, but it deals with an eternal theme: communication between couples.  You have to see it carefully to understand and not see it superficially.|, I just finished watching this movie. 👍I hope it received an Oscar. 🏆The chemistry between Keira Knightley and Alexander Skarsgard is superb. I think he dropped down from heaven. A sight for sore eyes 😍Keira is such brilliant actress.|, Why the hell would you leave your girl alone with a hunk like that... Good Lord. He's like a wingless angel.|, I swear she cheats in every movie, yet... I'm always here for it.|, keira knightly is one of my favorites and her movies set in the past are fantastic. in addition, i'm very intrigued by this look at Germany from a perspective that is not overdone. That said, i'm not going to watch it because of the adultery. i would really like to see more movies with characters of depth and interest who make THE BEST decisions they can instead of compromised ones.|, Keira's really going for that Oscar with this and Colette.

People say that she is lucky for not aging, but it is a curse, and this movie shows it.|, this movie was so much better than i had expected it to be. hesitated for so long but finally watched it. i thought maybe i'd have skip through it halfway but didn't feel like pausing for a second when i was actually watching it. it's one of those movies that stay with you for a long time. an inexplicably fascinating concept with intrinsic emotions. feel good, thoughtful and timeless. also Blake's acting was remarkable as always. would definitely recommend if you're looking for a drama that isn't just from the basic romance genre.|, I really love this movie! Adaline was so classy and elegant. Everything in this movie is so powerful and you can really feel their emotions.|, Such a beautiful movie! Just what I needed for the begininng of 2019. I cryed from the love Blake gave into this role, and the whole cast was just perfect♡♡♡ Thank you!|, What a great movie! Tear-jerker. The scene where she is talking to her daughter in the restaurant is mind-boggling. I love the last scene where she finds something which would make most people shudder.|, I got lost in this incredible film last night which is quite difficult these days. It quite literally saved my sanity. I’m so glad I never saw this trailer though. Would not have been as extraordinary an experience. Blake Lively gives a tour de force performance. Owning her character alongside an A list cast of talent.  Beautifully crafted and produced, the story and script are perfection. 
Thank you!|, Saw this movie today; it was beautiful! I enjoyed every minute of it.  And to those who complain, “how is this possible?”. Well, It is a Science Fiction & Fantasy Drama film. What do you expect?  Anything is possible here. It is just like a Disney movie or Marvel movie, but better and different than most of them. This movie has a beautiful story that is nicely done.|, One of the best romantic movies I have ever seen in a long time. All the actors and actresses pulled off such an amazing performance. Blake and Harrison made me live the emotion rollercoaster. In short it was superb."

RIP Marc!|, I almost never write reviews, but this movie was incredible and so was Marc-Andre. I truly am sorry to hear about his passing, not only would I have loved to watch more of his awe-inspiring climbs, but he seemed like an authentic and kind human who positively impacted the lives of those around him. RIP.|, We are drawn to people who are living life doing what they were born to do. They make us take a look at our own lives and ponder what our purpose is. Even the small moments in the film were so impactful like Marc Andre hula hooping with Hevy Duty and the young boy who was so drawn to Marc Andre in Patagonia as it showed how his positive energy was shared with those around him. The world needs more people like MA.|, This is a truly great documentary that deserves to be watched by anyone who cares about their role in the world. This is definitely not just about a climber and climbing but a great deal more than that. I hope their efforts are rewarded at the Oscars as this is the best documentary I have seen for a number of years.|, He did what he did for nobody except himself. The true definition of chasing your dreams. What to be learned from this is the human potential and capabilities when you are chasing things for the right reasons. Absolutely inspirational. Can only strive to reach this level of self fulfillment|, I went to the theater to watch this when it came out. Granted it was the early showing, but no one else was there. Had it all to myself for this very inspirational life story.|, At the end, he made me question my existence. Rest In Peace legend!

I've now been rat daddy to many of these amazing little characters and all of them have stolen a little piece of my heart.|, I've just went to the very first projection of Maurice the fabulous, at the Utopiales festival in Nantes, and I can't wait to see it again when it will be released. I hope it will be well distributed in France (and elsewhere of course). It deserves it, it is a masterpiece!|, this looks like a sanitized version of the book with much more human added. This is a DARK book with similaritys to 'secret of nihm' or 'even watership down' at moments.
There is a shot of sardines dancing in the rat pit, and its pretty clean considering it was filled with blood and dead rats in the book.
The two kids seem to have been aged up considerably and 'the stupid looking kid' Kieth would never say he loves her. Maurice was not a nice character in the book till the climax, charming maybe, but hes a stray cat that uses people.
They will NEVER use the rat king from the book as a villain here.
The whole theme of the book was existential dread of what it means to be self aware|, I've just started reading this book and the trailer looks as amazing as Maurice! And the cast slays, can't wait to see it.|, This... is a lot more bright and colorful than I ever imagined the world was in the book. also a lot... nicer. something in the vein of Coraline would have been much better.|, Just watched this film at a film festival. Didn't know what to expect but it was pretty good! I'd like to watch it again once it officially comes out|, I really hope this is true to the book and hasn't been changed in a misguided attempt to 'improve' it. Looks great from what we see here. Really excited to see it!|, I just finished reading the book and it was terrific. A lot darker than this movie. Terry Pratchett made the book more realistic because he believed his young readers could handle it. And there were many real-life lessons that did not transfer to this sanitized movie adaptation. This movie is entertainment. The original book is a story that will stick with you for the rest of your life.|, Please be as wonderful as I want it to be. This is one of my favourite Terry Pratchett books. This looks fantastic."

I couldn't stop the tears falling off my eyes it was extremely powerful|, This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen in my life it actually made me cry 10/10|, Omg I just watched the movie & I cried my eyes out at all the different life experiences enzo had with his family. It’s the perfect interpretation of what life is & how fast time goes by, yet it feels like time has stayed still… this is definitely a movie to watch with your loved ones! 💙|, As a auto racer and a pet lover, I cried and laughed all the way through the book.

People were getting emotional in the parking lot after the show. 
WELL DONE HOLLYWOOD, WELL DONE!|, Well, I just watched this movie on cable. I'll never be the same. It wasn't sappy, yet I almost couldn't stop  crying. Such a beautifully spiritual movie.

This movie is freaking awesome!
Came back today to watch the full trailer with  such a sense of satisfaction!
😁|, as somebody who has been doing Karate since I was seven, I find this hilarious, and some of it very relatable, like running through sequences at work (1:54) (I did this at school alot), the massive hype up about things which in reality don't matter to much (2:17), and how much people hate withe belts (0:42) (context: alot of people join and become white belts, then they go up two or three belts then leave, yet still think they can take on anyone and win)|, This movie was really good. I loved the absurdity of some of the dialogue but it's delivered so sincerely. Gets pretty intense toward the 2nd half.|, As A Martial Artist I went to watch the film. For those that care the techniques presented in the film were accurately portrayed. What I always felt as a Martial artist is it’s good to Know Karate but carry a gun just in case this movie seems to confirm my beliefs. 😂😂 also I laughed inappropriately several times in the movie 😂😂."
The Art of the Steal,Greatest Art Movie Ever &quot;Art of the Steal&quot; (2009),opOczQeFIb4,465107,2948,484,"Totally enjoyed this art movie I think the director and producers did an amazing job and what a great success to get it made. Its an outrage that this happened a perfect example of people at the top who ganged up and conspired against Barnes. All for money greed and power, they totally went against his will and what he wanted to further their own desires and line their own pockets. It was an achievement that Barnes was able to secure his property for as long as he did. The people involved which sadly it seems but not surprisingly looks like a lot eventually got what they wanted shame on them.|, So sad. Barnes vision was brilliant. Captured an amazing art movement for his museum. While no doubt the elite of the American museums laughed at him. He understood the quality and relevance of the art he collected. Not just sad, criminal.|, When Henri Matisse says ""it's the only sane place to see art in America"" you do whatever has to be done to keep The Barnes Foundation running where it is. Anything else is motivated by self serving reasons.|, Just remember:  Barnes appreciated and collected this art in defiance of the Philadelphia art establishment, who had only contempt for it.  But now that it's worth $5 billion . . . it's a whole different story.|, Thank you so much for sharing this film! The art world is and has been full of filth almost anywhere there was people involved in power and greed, sadly. We art lovers and artists should fight and re unite for more justice everyday. Loved the music too...|, I think this is a movie that all art majors should see - something I didn't learn in ArtHII. Thanks for this,  a piece of work! Can't believe they got away w/ it.|, Thank you. Heartbreaking. It was a formative experience for me as a young painter in 1970, as a group of young artists/students we made a pilgrimage to the Barnes Foundation from Indiana. I first learned of Monticelli there. Part of its beauty was  experiencing the art as if in a home. So personal. And precious in that one had to observe the restricted times to visit. Everything about it was special.|, I was fortunate enough to visit the Barnes Foundation in 1981 when Dr. Barnes assistant, Violette de Mazia ran the Foundation and had complete control. It was a very special place, holding some of the most famous paintings in the world, all within an intimate and private setting. There was no evidence of water damage. The building was actually quite beautiful.|, incredible film. can't believe it. definitely makes one consider how to move along in the art world, whether you're an art handler, proficient artist, or even just a visitor|, I recently visited the Barnes Museum, which does in fact reproduce  the rooms with their arrangement of paintings and other objects. It was overwhelming, and I thought of him constantly. The rooms were so much not designed for the many people trudging through, though. If I had had to write to the Foundation to get a ticket to visit, I probably would not have done so. But the experience would have been more wonderful, with fewer people and more time."
The Assistant,"THE ASSISTANT Trailer (2020) Julia Garner, Drama Movie",6cLf0i-kYio,3600229,24492,1533,"I love that she's getting lead roles and becoming a star. Well deserved... she's an amazing actress.|, Just saw this movie and I love it. It is one of those where nothing happens and everything happens. I loved the little office conversations and the the other officesounds- water cooler, opening packages, silent elevator. It really captures how it feels to be in an environment like that- especially when you're young. So happy not to be there now|, Loved this movie. Really appreciated the simple yet powerful messages. What I appreciated the most is that with all the education she has, at the end of the day, on the job experiences let you down. Even when you’re trying to do the right thing.|, this movie was actually flawless. don't say that about too much i see these days. julia garner anchors with a razor-sharp lead performance but the supporting cast, esp. matthew macfadyen, is equally strong. the writing is pitched precisely and authentically, the production as a whole claustrophobic. also, the cinematography i found astoundingly good. overall it's not quite my favorite movie ever but i walked away from it thinking it was exactly everything it hoped itself to be simply due to the top of the line work from cast, crew, and creative team. i would recommend it to anyone.|, I like this movie, I get why some people hate this movie for it being ""too realistic"", but I think that what makes this movie interesting and great. If you're looking for an action movie then this is not for you, if you're looking for a realistic, tense and intriguing story then this is for you.|, Julia Garner is captivating in every thing she's in. Definitely one of the best young actresses around. Can't wait to see this.|, Ya'll need to watch out for Julia Garner. She's has a very promising acting career. What a talent!|, She is such a good actress. I can't wait to see her in more roles.|, Love that this trailer is not like a mini version of the movie like other trailers. The base story line is still hidden, yet it gets your attention.|, That scene with Matthew Macfadyen was  masterclass acting. Aside from that, there's  no much else I can say about this movie. It could've easily be condensed into a great 30/40 minute short film instead of dragging  out for 80 minutes."

Ive recommended to all my friends they have to check this film out!!|, I was very surprised by all the bad reviews, that it's just a matter of taste in the end. I loved this film because it is very original in its approach, very different from films in general. It's a film that takes the time to set the context, the emotions ... I found it realistic in a way, because not all stories are spectacular, eventful and so on. This film is based on feelings.|, One of the greatest films ever made. Eye opener. Truly ahead of its time. The lineup alone tells the story. Some people will find it hard to grasp what's happening, where it's going, where's the dialogue, the acting, the sound and etc, but once you finish this film, you will realise everything at the end. How profound, how subterranean, how litumas.|, I've seen it at the world premiere back in September. It's nothing like ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at night"" but it's awesome nonetheless! Ana Lily Amirpour did a great job, such an unique film.|, Well, idk what's this film about, but soundtrack is cool. And there is Momoa... and Keanu. I hope it won't suck.|, People hating on this why? Give it a chance. Director is trying something fresh and not the same thing we keep getting over and over in the theaters. Looks like a good cast and great music choice for the trailer. John wick and khal drogo bro!|, this was one of those movies where at the end i had no idea wtf i just watched but i really enjoyed watching it|, Just watched this. Awesome movie. Beautifully shot, great soundtrack, but every 10 minutes I'm asking 'where are they getting their resources?'|, This trailer feels so different in tone than the ""teaser"", it looks real good and I hope it ends up being a successful movie.|, I think this looks spectacular! So cheesy, brilliant vibe and music, and I loved A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. Can't wait to see this."

It has a solid plot, plenty of cowboy action scenes, and salt-of-the-earth characters anyone can relate to.  Also, if you find yourself craving some authentic frontier gibberish, this movie may satisfy on that score as well.  It's got it all.|, Great film! Pullman is fantastic. I’m genuinely surprised how many people dislike and/or are ambivalent on this film.|, Westerns? Bring them on ! Love them.  I can watch them all day.|, Such an underrated film! A classic western|, If you like classic westerns...you'll like this. Bill Pullman is excellent.|, I remember seeing this at the Chicago film fest. Don’t remember much of the plot but what I took From this was bill Pullman’s Oscar worthy performance.|, Anyone agree that Pullman just keeps getting better with age? Can’t wait to stick this on when I get home|, My roomie and I watched this today and we really enjoyed it.  If you like good ol' fashioned westerns you'll get a kick outta this one.|, Really, really good film, great characters, very enjoyable watch.|, The is the best simple western story I’ve seen in many years.

The Banshees of Inisherin,THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures,uRu3zLOJN2c,10444118,54983,3231,"Such a delight to see these two on screen together again. Pure magic.|, Transports you to a different world. You start the movie, and 1 hour later, it is nowhere you thought it will be. Magic to see this cast together again! 9/10|, Anyone who says the film is boring or nothing happens -  I went from  curiosity as to what was the cause of the falling out, to laughing hysterically in the confession scene with Brendan's character to complete and utter heartbreak at the ending sequence and everything in between - it was an emotional roller coaster and I'm not sure how some people aren't seeing it.  It forces you to be introspective and empathetic.  We've all been through the situation...maybe not as in-your-face as the two main characters but people come and go from your life and it's not always your choice, and you can't always control it. It affected me long after I walked out of the theater.|, Beautiful movie about despair, loneliness, leaving a mark on the world to be remembered by, and the damage it can do to others. The theme of brutal and nasty humans, versus gentle, kind, nice animal loving people is so well done. The kid that played Dominic was a revelation. Excellent movie.|, Martin mcdonagh is a man who doesn't give a shit about what sells in Hollywood, he's a man with a commitment to true storytelling. I'm always heartbroken when his films aren't  widely adopted by the general movie going audience, but I honestly envy his ability to digest and express the human condition in a way that makes every persons heart skip an odd beat in their chest when they see the baser part of their character laid bare in such a beautiful and compassionate way. This is a man who understands the darker side of the human psyche and expresses it in such a way that the misanthropy prevalent in our society is given a strong voice while at the same time being gently guided to a level of understanding and compassion towards those around us and their many failings and foibles, and I fir one can't wait to hear this man's voice again.|, This was excellent. It’s been a while since a movie covered such a gamut of emotions so extensively, and much of that can be attributed to the expert acting by Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell. The symbolism of the civil war brewing and creating tension alongside the ending of their friendship was brilliant. I appreciated that we walked into their lives having not seen what their friendship looked like when it was thriving, but at the beginning of its end. 

For anyone who has had a friendship interrupted or severed, this hits a nerve, but not necessarily in a way that opens old wounds. I saw this two days ago, but it’s safe to say that this film will be on my mind for quite sometime.|, Martin Mcdonagh is a man born in England who we fully accept, embrace and love as an Irishman. In Bruges was two of the best Irish characters ever put on screen. It looks like he's only gone and done it again|, Loved it! This movie hits home for me because when i was in highschool i had a best friend for years who then went cold with me and decided she wanted to cut me off. For a long time i tried to bring the magic back between us, and wasnt able to let go. I find it relatable and painful, but very beautiful.|, I watched this movie very recently. It is a roller coaster of emotions. I felt so bad for  the friend who lost so much, he was really the only kind, normal individual on the island. I was enthralled by 5 minutes. I was not expecting the ending and cried my eyes out. It left me quite bereft and sad. Beautifully haunting. 5 stars from me.|, This movie absolutely incredible. Both insanely funny and painfully tragic, in a true Martin McDonagh fashion. Beautifully shot. I would say this is his strongest film yet. Colin Farrell's career best perfomance."
The Batman,THE BATMAN – Main Trailer,mqqft2x_Aa4,60471700,1339149,96287,"OH MY GOD Michael Giacchino's Batman Theme is EPIC!!!!!!!|, You know it's a great movie when it's almost 3 hours long but don't get the urge to check how much time is left. A classic.|, This movie is proof that superhero movies can still be good|, A year ago today. Seeing this in theaters was a masterpiece. Every scene was perfectly built as I was watching Se7en. I saw it with my dad and my theater clapped after the movie was over. An experience I'll never forget.|, ive watched this movie a billion times and everytime i see the trailer it still gives me goosebumps|, Does anyone else come back to this trailer once in a while just to relive the moment you heard the words “I’m vengeance” for the first time?|, The ending shot where Batman walks out of the fire like an immortal madman is just….pure beauty.|, This was, not only the best Batman movie but honestly the best superhero movie that I've seen in such a long time. Matt Reeves understands Batman and these characters like I've never seen before, everyone was so perfectly cast, and the world-building is insane. This might be the new Dark Knight trilogy of the next decade.|, This is one of the greatest trailers of all time. I come back and watch it every once in a while.|, When The movie is *SO GOOD* That even after the trailer spoiled half of the plot but no one complains on that. Best Batman Movie indeed"
The Battle at Lake Changjin,China&#39;s depiction of US forces in 2021&#39;s &quot;The Battle for Lake Changjin&quot;,fmBjkb-r8Fw,381302,5442,2607,"macarthur enters like a fucking metal gear solid villain lmao|, As an American, I'm quite flattered over how they portrayed US forces; supposedly depicting them as an evil invading imperialists, but they actually made them into more cool, tough, and intimidating, showing off navy barrage, convoys of tanks and armours, helmets, technology, and air force which was the whole point; Americans were tougher than Japanese, Kuomintang, and South Koreans to beat and technologically superior. That depiction is quite fair and more accurate, humanizing the American soldiers, unlike old Chinese Korean War movies like Battle of Shanganling  Mountain where they were depicted as imperialist monsters and cowards. The only thing that looks off of these Americans are the voices, some don't sounded American. MacArthur sounds fine but Liam Nesson did good job potraying him in Operation Chromite. One soldier mentioned about beating Japanese in WW2 and ""their legacy"", is probably meant to tell Chinese audience that US and China were allies during that time and Korean War is where US is an enemy and film's antagonist. 

 I like how they don't straight telling the audience the fact that North Korea invaded South Korea, but gave them an implication by MacArthur's line ""We will take Seoul back!"", indicating their enemy took over Seoul which is occupied by North Koreans. They are did make the conflict accurate, but in fact, China rather not say over who started the war, but some say US started it, just like North Korea's history book. It is a propaganda, but it's a good movie and some may be written for dramatic fictional purpose just like Black Hawk Down. I'm going to pretend that Operation Chromite, Lake Changjin, and Devotion are in the same universe for Incheon Landing and Chosin Reservoir. 

Also, I learned that not many Chinese audience were impressed by the movie, according to the friend of mine, considering over what's going on currently in the Korean peninsula. I'm pretty sure few or some Chinese fans for K-Pop might appreciate MacArthur and Americans saving South Korea because without them, there'll be no K-Pop or its influence.

Anyways,  this movie is very impressive and it's great. Curious what American veterans think of this.|, I like how they showed the Army and Marines working closely with each other|, I like how, despite being a Chinese movie, it makes an American viewer feel so patriotic.|, Their portrayal of MacArthur being a larger than life character and his dismissive attitude aga the authority of commander and chief at that time(President Harry Truman) is actually quite accurate.|, One thing to note here is the sympathetic portrayal of Oliver P. Smith, who basically serves as the ""honorable enemy"" character throughout the film and is the only American that openly expresses doubts and sympathy to the Chines compared to the overconfidence of McArthur and the other commanders. This *might* have some historical grounds as Smith was one of the more cautious commanders of the battle who refused to blindly rush to cross the Yalu river and wound up saving many marines because of his caution and his leadership under fire is credited as saving his division from destruction. 

Later on in the film, one of the last American scenes is Smith and his marines stumbling into a Chinese foxhole filled with dead soldiers who had frozen to death attempting to hold the position from retreating American forces. Smith then salutes the fallen men out of respect and remarks that it was down to the sheer determination and grit of his enemy that they were able to be beaten back at all. It's such an unusually positive and sympathetic portrayal of an antagonist in a war film that I honestly can't remember anything comparable in a Hollywood production besides maybe the Cuban commander in Red Dawn.|, American technology really is incredible. They were communicating with text-to-speech software way back then. Amazing.|, Not gonna lie, this is surprisingly good.

Its refreshing to see the depiction of an enemy force as a powerful/competent and legitimately dangerous opponent to the protagonist.|, Now THIS is how you portray the enemy in a war movie. Not weak undisciplined idiots nor evil plundering rapists but rather a respectable and formidable enemy who is a worthy challenge for the heroes.|, This makes me patriotic and I'm not even an American"

it's like a condensed movie into 2 minutes and 17 seconds 👌😙🤏|, Filmin konusu henüz bir bebek olan oğlunun esrarengiz bir şekilde ölümü ve ardı ardına gelişen olayları anlatıyor, güzel sürükleyici bir film izlemenizi tavsiye ederim.|, While as I am honestly not a North American here, this film that stars Olga is nothing but to be treated in the level of Troma films, as Troma was a name that was deeply known for making crap-level projects like ""The Toxic Avenger"", ""Class of Nuke'em High"", etc. Especially as Olga was diagnosed with Covid-19 until it was disappeared last year meant that this film, as having said that its deeply yet bloody crappy, would have terminate its development (as it was started before the pandemic) and thus have Olga learn from Lily Allen (who was a once-famous British musician known for ""Smile"" in 2006) for cheating retirement (hiatus) - as this would explain why ""Hollywood"" would just be held at gunpoint.|, Olga Kurylenko.... I'm all in..!|, She never aged in the last 20 years|, So... it gets to the ""climax"" of the trailer where literally EVERYONE that was in the movie is now holding a gun, but how is this supposed to even be anything?

Enjoy and leave a like!|, So excited to see the Matthew McConaughey biography!|, Harmony is so much more than spring breakers, it's a bummer that's all the majority of the general public know him from. He's easily one of the most talented and influential writers/directors of our time. The man is a genius. A living legend.|, ""Is he a good pilot?"" ""Nah man he got glaucoma in both his eyes.""  😂😂😂 freaking great man|, Just watched it last night and it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!|, This project was a 1 hour 35-minute montage in search of a movie, but I loved _every second of it_ regardless! 😂

For me, this movie also tapped into what (some) writers have to do in order to achieve their goals.  Like members of any group, writers are not a monolith.  Every writer's process is different.  What society may deem ""unacceptable"" or ""crass"" others will use as muse.  And you can see that towards the end of the movie, once Snoop gives Moondog a boost.  All of that debauchery fueled his passion for using words in a poetic way.  I believe he even mentioned so in passing while in the midst of many montage scenes.

Hunter S. Thompson invoked a similar process.  That's how he tapped into the _Gonzo_ persona, as his characters leaped off the page and spilled out into the theater and all throughout the pop culture ether.  And those vaper trails still waft over us today.  

However, after HST's death, loved ones like ex-wife Sandy stated how his writing could have been a lot better if he have been sober.  This idea was repeated by a few of Hunter's contemporaries and close friends.  But to me that's bollocks.  If Hunter had written sober, sure, his writing may had been more focused; more linear; more mainstream.  And less _Gonzo Journalism._  Less _Raoul Duke._  Less _Freak Power._  Which would've sucked.

If a person's key to life is happiness, I'd say do what you love and never waver from whatever passion possesses you.  When the uninitiated try to tear you down or tell you _how_ to accomplish your goal(s), use that ignorance as fuel to push you through.  And forgive those who don't understand you, because we can't understand them.  As we need their forgiveness, too.|, When is part two coming out? That was seriously the funniest movie I've seen in a long time."

I remember the Beatles as if they were family or neighbors.    I admit now that I’ve taken it all for granted in this fantastic retrospective.    Nothing before and nothing since has eclipsed the Beatles phenomenon.    I am a musician and I remember a moment right after I had signed to RCA,   I was looking at a poster of The Rubber Soul album I had and I started crying.    I had just signed a recording contract and felt such a personal victory……then I realized that no matter what takes place in my musical future,  I’ll never be in the Beatles.   It was a moment in history that is still unmatched.     Possibly never will be matched.   It’s like losing your virginity.   It can only happen ONCE|, I don't think people today can fathom how big the Beatles were 50 years ago.  Take Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Miley Cyrus, One Direction, and Justin Bieber combined.

And of course every time I look up to see what’s going on, when I look at the screen, it’s like I become hypnotized. I stop working for a good 1520 minutes because I have to watch this movie. It’s taking me through it all again. Watching them walk on the lawn of Shea stadium I’m reminded That it is the biggest thing that ever happened.|, The Beatles: Eight Days a Week is a superb documentary made by Ron Howard and is about the touring years from 1963 to 1966 when they decided to quit going on the road. It features archival footage of the Beatles concerts and the mayhem they put up with.
I really enjoyed this film. If you are a Beatles fan or not it's a fascinating look at the band in their prime, The thing that strikes me is how together they were and how professional they were especially considering the screaming was so loud that they couldn't hear themselves play. 
Needless to say the music is great and Ron Howard has made it so in every concert you can hear them playing clearly while still hearing the pandemonium going on around them. 
What I didn't realise was that the Beatles quit touring so early but you can see why they had to. There is brilliant footage of their last live performance together on the roof of the Apple building in London shot exactly two months after I was born and the difference between them then and five years previous is staggering.

I love this line lol|, ""Every loser with a couple million bucks in a fund.."" that line always makes me laugh.|, I must've seen this scene 20 times. How do you write a two hour script where every line is an absolute banger? It's incredible.  
It's so funny the way Jared is just openly antagonistic to the people he's selling to in their own office|, In a movie full of cheap celebrity drop-ins, 4th wall breaking and talking directly to the camera, and all sorts of quick ways to explain things to the audience, this is by far their most brilliant scene in explaining a complex concept with perfect clarity.|, “Take a seat” he says while standing in THEIR office. Love it.|, 7:06 I love how Vinnie looks stone-faced the whole movie, making occasional sarcastic wisecracks and insults towards his co-workers, but after Jared explains CDOs and how they are all a fraud, and how the government and banks are asleep at the wheel, there is a look of complete terror and sadness in his eyes.

Jeremy Strong is an incredible actor.|, Ryan Gosling is so amazing in this scene. The way he delivers the words is perfect.|, ""I'm standing in front of a burning house, and I'm offering you fire insurance on it!"" I love that quote|, “That’s pretty racist” gets me every time.|, One of my favourite scenes in film. Especially ""Thank you."" ""Fucking A, Jared."" ""Shut your fucking mouth."". Kills me every time lol."

It deserves more recognition than it actually gets. Oscar nominee... Yeah but it deserves more. It stirred up so many emotions while I was watching it. <3|, It looks so cool, and I'm glad they're introducing different cultural perspectives on life/love. This reflects real life.|, This is one of the best romantic comedies ive seen in a VERY long time. Definitely worth watching.|, One of the best films I've seen all year. Great sense of humor, Romano is understated and perfect. Hunter delivers one of her most genuine performances in years.|, I usually don't have the patience for romcoms but this movie was too charming. Zoe Kazan is great she should be in more movies.|, Inmense movie. Loved every second of it|, This is a really good movie.  From start to finish.  The ending was even perfect.|, I cant believe I have not heard more about this movie! It was fantastic.  I am not much into romance films but this was beautifully written.|, It’s on streaming and I’m definitely going to watch it!
Love the cast and excited to meet the new actress if she’s new.. she seems great 👍"

I love you Ben!|, I love this film sooo much! It's soo hilarious especially the rehearsal dinner scene.|, I actually really like this movie. It deserves better reviews than it is received. Although, it isn't to the level of some of these A-class stars, it is an engaging romantic comedy. The plot didn't feel like it was dragging and there was enough character development that kept you interested in the cast. There wasn't enough Robin Williams and all of his scenes are pretty much in the trailer. His character was too similar to the character in License to Wed.|, I honestly don't think the trailer does the movie justice, this is such an amazing heart warming film that everyone should see|, Absolutely love this cast. It must have been totally fun on set!
|, I actually loved this movie, the interplay between characters and family dynamics sold the movie|, It's a shame that the trailer didn't mention Ben Barnes. That's the problem with the movie industry: they only exhibit the names that they believe people will want to see, and much of the time, they are wrong. Ben had such a big role in this film, and played the character so well...why, I bet some people don't even know that he's British...since he pulled of the accent in this movie so well.|, Each time I see Ben isnt mentioned in the cast I swallow my anger and think ""Ben, youre just too perfect for that business to be mentioned,you are a great actor,you look hilarious and you can sing very well and and...you are just too gorgeous for them""|, You cant judge the movie until you have seen it. I have seen the movie and it was actually a really GREAT movie!

And how brutal nature is.|, Just watched with my 11 year old, we both loved it! Very inspiring! 👏  we loved being able to see how everything is really connected and equally important!|, Absolutely beautiful! I watched this and cried. So touched.

Looks amazing.|, One of the best documentary, I have ever seen.|, This movie was soooo good I watched it again the next day.|, Just heard that a sequel documentary, ""The Biggest Little Farm: The Return"", is scheduled to premier on Disney Plus for Earth Day (April 22) 2022.

I’m just interested in silent era films|, 19 minutes in and i've already graduated college, moved to LA, attended my first movie premiere, got married, and received an Oscar.|, Check this one off my bucket list. For years I have wanted to watch the silent film, ""Birth of a Nation."" Finding time to focus on a silent movie for nearly three and one-half hours was beyond difficult. I broke it into segments and got through it over about a week. It is a true cinematic masterpiece. With none of the special effects technology in the ensuing decades and certainly no CGI we see today, it is a marvel. The elaborate sets, costumes, and smoky battle scenes are amazing if you think of the resources producer DW Griffith had to work with.

A cinematic masterpiece, yes, but also intense racist gaslighting. The movie is basically broken into two chapters: Civil War and post-war Reconstruction. While the war story culminating with the Lincoln assassination is Confederate-slanted, the story of Reconstruction is flat-out racist. Blacks are represented as corrupt and oppressive to whites. 

The heroes? The Ku Klux Klan. They organized, took up arms, and rose up to beat back the black menace. This was heralded throughout America as good and just. The goal was to restore America - especially the South - to its greatness, its old way of life.

Keep in mind this film is distinguished as the first movie to have a White House viewing. This came under the administration of Woodrow Wilson who hosted an elaborate dinner party with choice political leaders and influencers across the country. In addition to that premiere showing at the White House in 1915, the movie was re-released 15 years later at the end of the silent film era in 1930.

I mention this because the film continues to echo a bigoted message today. This is not because a significant number of Americans are watching it, but because the ugly message it carries is a narrative that was passed down through generations. Tens of millions of Americans look at our cultural past through the gauzy lens of nostalgic remembrance of American life. This was true in the 1870s, 1915, 1930, and today. They just deny any attempt to bring our society to face its terrible practices. 

This amazing artifact of American media culture should be folded into the lesson plans of university and high school history classes. Break it into segments for homework and then use that to fuel classroom discussion. It should be dissected to understand its historical context and how it contributed to today's behavior. The past never leaves us, it informs us and lives within us. The good, the bad, and the disturbingly hateful."

The Black Phone,The Black Phone - Official Trailer,3eGP6im8AZA,37156948,265865,13844,"Looks like a really good movie but dang yall giving so much away in the trailer... please stop doing that!|, Ethan Hawke and the child actors really raised the film to a higher level, especially the sister knocked it out of the park. One point in the film I really didn't know whether she was getting beat up for real by her dad or whether it was acting, because that was some of the most realistic crying I have ever seen.|, the kid actors in this are incredibly - some of the best acting I've seen from child actors in a long time. Incredible movie. Drags a bit in the middle but the ending is great.|, I just went to the theater to see it about 4 hours ago and it was amazing. The child actors were literally amazing and sometimes I couldn’t even tell they were acting. The thriller was filled with a lot of suspense which made it very interesting to watch. Overall, the movie was great and I really enjoyed it|, One of the best horror-thriller with an emotional touch.
This movie is quite unique cuz it's horror-thriller where there are both a serial killer and ghosts.

I like how the story isn't just about making people scared or feeling goosebumps but it also has character development and a family story which you can relate to.

There are several touching moments which makes the movie stand out from the rest of this genre.

Also love the performances by both the siblings actors.

I swear once you get to the part where the boy is kidnapped, you'll be hooked to your seat.|, Something about this is touching. The scene where the boy is practicing hitting with the phone and the ghost is there with him was pretty cool, but for some reason the idea that these kids were there to walk him through and help him succeed where they failed really hit hard. It was like they were his guardian angels.|, Movie was amazing! Loved how they kept the setting true to the decade. The trailer actually does not give away what actually happens, just intense scenes to draw you in. Worth the watch. You won’t be disappointed.|, Watched this in theaters the first day it came out, and when I tell you this is the best horror movie i’ve seen. I was lost for words afterward. It got my anxiety going off the charts and it even had some funny scenes. Outstanding and i’m going to watch it for the third time in theaters tomorrow !|, My absolute favorite movie of all time! Ethan Hawke was electrifyingly SCARY and the kid who played Finny and the kid who played Gwenny absolutely KILLED IT! Every actor in this film killed it! 10 out of 10! BRILLIANT!!! 👏 👏 👏|, What everyone is missing about the movie and the kids is... the daughter has visions (like her mother did) and dreams about events that come true. But Finny the brother... can talk to spirits. The boys the Grabber killed can communicate with him because he too has that gift from his mother. They just got different versions of her gifts. Gwen has visions...Finny can see the spirits"

Extremely impressed with it ; watching it at 3 am also enhanced the experience|, I really appreciate how atmospheric and evocative this movie was, and that it never threw in cheap jump scares just for the sake of it. Some of the imagery is beyond creepy, and will definitely stick with you.|, One of my favorite horror films. I've seen it 3 times (iirc) and each time something new pops up, but the same quality always shines through. While it has not yet dethroned my top, Rosemary's baby, it ranks among such lofty horror classics. I'm sure this is one that will be revered by many as time passes.|, Just watched this last night. Such an amazing film. A true masterpiece in slow-building horror!|, Such a masterpiece. Right up there with the Exorcist. No bullshit, perfect atmosphere, unique plot and realization. One of the best possession movies out there.|, in my humble opinion this movie is A Slow_Burner masterpiece
oh my god the atmosphere, the tention, the suspense, the chills, the excellent dark tone, the acting from the 3 leads especially kiernan shipka, the score &the editing, the  cinematography, this movie kills it on those level. this is one of those open for interpretation Implores a second viewing kind of movies that stays with u after u watch it 
it reminded me alot of the witch my fav film last year u either gonna love it or hate it
i have just minor problem with the film i hope they did something about it when they release the film in the theatres and i'm sure a lot of people will argue about it when they reveiw this film. overall excellent film definitely worth checking out on the big screen
but not for everyone cus it's R rated.
i love this new wave of horror films not the same old cliched jumpscares bs|, Just watched this. Can def recommend it. Indelible experience. Is a slow burner, can be desensitized to some scenes because of movies like hereditary, but the end twist hit me strong and brought it home. Also worth noting has solid acting and a top notch soundtrack(his majesty)|, Great film. A film that respects the art of film making, as opposed to mainstream cinema's constant pandering to the lowest common denominator.|, This one is a gem. Best score I've heard in a long time. Exquisite photography. Perfect casting 👌🏼"

A great spoof based on traditional horror movies. ✌️|, 😂 I remember this was just a skit on Comedy Central, but seeing this as a movie I'm about to be in stitches from laughter.|, Just saw this at an early screening. I loved it. The whole theater was dying laughing. Do yourself a favor and go see it in theaters before it goes to streaming|, ""They can't all die first' is cinematic brilliance|, I can't believe they turned that skit into a movie!!!!

She worked so hard to fight for her family and to see Phil saved|, I read Phil's book, several years ago and hoped someone would see the potential and 😢would make it a movie. Kay's faith is what kept the family intact through the hard times, and she deserves a lot of the credit for what the family is today.|, I’m trying not to bawl like a baby watching this trailer because I’m where Ms Kay was, fighting for my marriage. I’ve been fighting for over 8 years and fighting in the spirit for my husband to come back to God. It will all be worth it when God comes through and they are an inspiration to me|, We went to see The Blind last night.  It was INCREDIBLE!  The movie was beautifully written.  The cinematography made me feel as though I was in the Louisiana swamp - BEAUTIFUL!  There was never a dull moment.  Thank you Phil and Kay for allowing your story to be shown.  Thank you Jesus for showing us another way!|, This story is very similar to my parent's story. After my dad lost his family due to partying, drinking and staying gone all the time. I was 4 when my dad finally got it together and started going to church and taking us with him. My parents reconciled and started going to church together and life was pretty good from then on. Thank you Lord for saving my family|, I’m not typically someone that enjoys going to watch movies like these, but over the years of hearing bits and pieces of their story I wanted to find out further. I was shocked. I never imagined a movie like this could impact my life that much. I truly thank God for whomever all worked on this film did their best because it showed and I would reccomend to literally everyone!!! I would never turn down watching this movie again either- it’s that good.|, Oh man, I can’t wait to see this. I tear up every time I see Phil on his knees and he slams his hand on the ground. I’ve been there my friend. Sometimes the Lord has to get us to a place that we’ll yield and submit to Him. Even in our lowest times, He is faithful.|, I am looking so forward to seeing the movie. Have always loved this family. Yes Miss Kay deserves so much recognition for all she did to fight for her family. A strong woman|, I CAN NOT wait to see this movie!! The Robertsons are such a great family and their story is so inspirational.|, My first experience with duck commander was when I was 3; my dad first took me to the duck blind. I was too young to shoot so I was the ""designated caller.""
We got all the calls I wanted, I watched all VHS tapes of ""The Duckmen of Louisiana,"" and I had the casettes to play as we drove to the salten sea so I could learn more about the art of calling. Far before Duck Dynasty, I had a strong connection to Phil and the family. And I'm glad Kay and his story is getting told with respect and production value. And one day, I'll be teaching my daughter how to call just as I did, with the same calls the robertsons always made by hand."

It's actually really impressive how Emma can pull off two completely different roles.|, I really liked this movie, it's told with great taste and it really reflects the reality of what happened. Of course, Emma is the absolute star of this flick, no wonder the critics gave her rave reviews! She is a wonderful, A list actress.|, i love this movie so much.  i was  21 when this went down, and I wanted this life. This kinda put things into perspective for me, and allowed me to relive the time :)|, This just proves Emma Watson can ACT and portray characters outside of her Hermione Granger legacy. If she can focus and get into a role like this, this movie was a huge step for her and she is on her way to becoming one of the best, well known Actresses in History. Not only does she have a good personality as a person, she also sticks to her roots and models British Fashion. She stepped out of her comfort zone to do this movie, and I think that's brilliant.|, I had the same feeling until i saw it. I LOVED IT! The things they did were jaw dropping!|, I love this movie it both glorifies self indulgence and condemns our obsession with excess |, Emma Watson is what made this movie tolerable"

Such family goals.|, Grateful that a family that genuinely loves each other is gonna get shown on the big screen <3|, I've been watching Bob's Burgers since 2011 and every day for the last two and half years of the pandemic. To say this show is my life is an Understatement. Can't wait for this movie!!!|, I don’t know why everyone thinks this movie did terrible to be honest, this is one of very little movies that actually made me feel pure joy throughout the whole movie.|, This is quite literally the only movie that could make me go to a theater again|, Never felt so wholesome after seeing a movie…this one hit me so positively|, Bob freaks out just like Tina does I love it.|, My husband got excited with me after seeing the trailer. He said we would go to get the best burger in town before going to see the movie where we will sneak in burger sliders. I love this man.|, And to imagine the creators' journey got them this far. Incredible. Inspiring. Unimaginable. But proof is in the pudding. Do what you love.

It’s not scary”|, ""It's the thing that comes for your kids when you're not paying attention""
That sends chills down my spine...|, This is the best horror film I’ve seen in a looooooong old time. Plays on all of your childhood fears and phobias and sends chills down your spine. Definitely recommend|, This is one of my favorite horror movies I’ve seen. Most plots are cheesy and not well built, they only focus on jump scares. The way they surrounded the boogeyman with mystery and finally unveiled him at the very end really makes this movie a must watch and unique. The right amount of jump scares with great acting. 9/10|, Im not someone that gets scared of horror movies, but omg this one was so well done and terrifying! No cheap jumpscares, no cringeworthy CGI or failed special effects,,, the monster was genuinely well orchestrated and scary. Would def watch again and recommend.|, This movie was pretty good, 7.5/10 in my opinion. It was so emotional, very sad with what the main family is going through. I really feel bad for the older daughter. The acting is really good. And the movie had awesome editing. The camera movement in some of the scenes where it was upside down first then the camera moved, was epic!|, I read this short story by Stephen King in his “Night Shift” book and it truly terrified me. Most of the setting takes place in a psychiatrist’s office while the children’s father narrates the entire story while lying on a couch, as his doctor listens and writes notes. Very scary twist at the end, too. Hope this film gives it justice! ❤|, A bedtime story turns into a horror movie this actually has lots of potential to be great|, A horror trailer that actually gives me goosebumps & having me wanting to see it. Well done. 

It’s been years since a good horror trailer has been well made.🔥

EDIT: I’ve seen the movie. Enjoyed it. Some jump scares got me. Some predictable/ some not. The atmosphere was great. So was the sound effects. 

It gave me Stranger Things/ Lights Out vibes. The way the movie started has given me chills. I give it a 8/10. Wasn’t the best/ worst but I pretty much enjoyed it. The creature design was pretty cool. (🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨)Also, the way the creature threw the girl at the tv was both jaw dropping & hilarious. 

If your a fan of Creature Features. Definitely would recommend!💪🏽|, I saw this movie in theaters. It was absolutely terrifying I loved it"

They will just see it as another WWII movie. I know people who haven't read it but loved it because they appreciate words, writing, and reading like Liesel and Max did. I've read the book and it's beautiful.  I'm sorry some of you guys can't see that.|, ... I've never cried over a book in my life.
Unfortunately the Book Thief broke this record.
Darn it.|, I won the book as a prize from school. It is literally the best thing I've been given in life. Just finished reading. Can't stop crying over the end.|, I just finished the book yesterday and am in no way stable right now. ""The end of the world part 2"" had me uncontrollably sobbing and I have never in my life cried over a book before.|, I feel like the people who made this movie didn't understand the book at all. It's not the fact that they left some things out that bothered me. It was the fact that they're making seem like some sort of inspiring story about hope, but it's not. It's supposed to be a bittersweet story that educates, that teaches the audience how words are the most powerful force on this planet, and how devastating the result is when they are misused (example: Hitler). The entire theme is changed in the movie.|, The book is so sad. Just finished it and I'm still drowning in my tears|, The little girl tore my heart when she runs her hands over the books with such love.

When they were reincarnated as Manolo and Maria after Lady Micte’s death, La Muerte took her sister’s place and chose Manolo to marry Maria not only to finish what Lady Micte had started, but also to reunite Maya and Zatz together again. 

Jorge R. Gutierrez even confirmed that they’re even the same characters.

Manolo sang this as a proposal to marry Maria. 
Zatz said this as a promise to be with Maya forever."

Watch it! |, I always loved her acting. She definitely has to be on more movies|, i seriously cannot wait for this movie. it makes me so happy to see jen getting these big roles and making people understand she's such an amazing actress. as a triple threat, most people only focus on one of her talents. but she's such a professional and so amazing at every single thing she puts her hands on. this movie is already slaying me tbh, it just shows how many sides of jen the actress you can see. it's not the typical rom-com, the happy ever ending type of movie, and she'll show y'all that's totally fine, because great actresses just make everything work. and if you're calling jennifer a ""hoe"" for having a sex scene in a movie (it's called acting btw in case you didn't know) then i guess all actresses are considered hoes huh? anyway, grow up a lil cmon. stop looking at the worst side of things, or trying to find them and just start focusing on the best ones. this movie is perfect already and if you don't like it just don't watch it. as simple as that:) |, This was a very underrated movie. Alot of people should know that one of Jlo's speciality in acting in movies is thrillers. She did great ones, such as The Cell and Enough. This movie was a great comeback for her career. Yeah, alot of you guys think it's  a stupid movie because her character nails a guy younger than her and she is doing something similar  in real life but that's not the point. This movie was great, alot of twists and turns and something different from the usual stuff we see on screens.

And for anyone complaining about the CGI, it’s because the dogs were abused in the movie, they couldn’t get real dogs to be abused like that. This movie has animal abuse from one of the evil characters in it so it’s good they’re CGI so no real dogs were hurt. This movie was beautiful and amazing and it made me cry 💕|, You forget about the CGI once you start getting more into the movie. Emotionally moving and many great messages to apply to ourselves and life itself.|, I don’t care about the CGI or deriving from the plot. Call of the Wild will forever be my favorite book and I think this movie was heartwarming and amazing.|, Buck is such a good boy 🥺 was waiting for him to be reunited with his sled group but loved the ending. Great movie!|, Saw this last night and I absolutely loved it. Its such a genuine film with a great story and a big heart. My advice is dont get bogged down being distracted by the CGI or the fact that it's not as dark as the book, take it in the spirit that it was made in which is a good one.|, Just watched. 10/10 for me. There is a powerful philosophical, psychological, and for me, spiritual message in this story. Will definitely watch again.|, This hit me right in the feels!! Beautiful movie indeed. Totally worth watching for me|, The movie is absolutely gorgeous! The music is well-done too and overall the movie feels very epic <3|, I just watched this movie for the first time and it was so much better than I had hoped it would be!  You pretty much get used to the CGI after a couple of minutes. It was done well and a great way to add some subtle expression and emotions to the dogs and wolves. The first half of the storyline with the whole owner to owner thing kind of gave me Black Beauty vibes. The music and scenery is also very beautiful, from northern light skies to arctic planes and mountain landscapes. I truly enjoyed this movie.|, Despite the fact that most of the cgi was unnecessary IMO, the movie was absolutely incredible and I highly recommend it."

Loved the whole film too.|, I was thinking this was an extremely well directed yet derivative redemption tale up until the third act. What a twist. Easily one of my favourites of the year.|, Just came back home from watching this movie. Ironically, I loved it for what most viewers hated it - the slow pace. I was so mesmerized by the main character and Oscar Isaac's performance, I swear I could just watch a 10 hour movie of him living his life. A great exploration of loneliness and trauma induced by war. The ending just made me slightly confused. I didn't like the way Schrader decided to rapidly move the plot in the last 10 minutes, the movie just kinda lost its meditative mood. 

Anyway, people are way too harsh on this one. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea but I could see myself recommending it to certain people.|, Schrader's writing, per usual, is amazing and the screenplay might be this movies only saving grace. Idk if it Schrader didn't have the budget he asked for or if there was a problem with due dates or whatever but direction-wise the film has a very unfinished feel to it. Again, if ur a fan of Schrader's masterful screenwriting this one is worth giving a shot but other than that, respectfully pass|, Excellent film. I loved Isaac and Haddish chemistry. Really added to the story. The ending scene was unique, I appreciate the creativity of the director.|, A very good film, and it used card games as a cover for the real story hidden deep in the subtext. 10/10.|, This movie is phenomenal. It’s a pity the trailer doesn’t do it justice.|, This film is one of the few to give the viewer a reality check on a subject needing a serious public debate, it is on something terrible, but I don't find it explicit if you are not oversensitive. The cinematography conveys this very well, with crudity and realism, although many visual metaphors are at display. The script is well made and has one of the best sub-tramas seen recently. Yes it has an independent film aura, like it or hate it that depends on taste. I think it deserves recognition, specially being produced during Covid. It is quite worth it if you are not an ""amusement park"" film enjoyer.|, Im a massive shraeder fan and I was totally absorbed in this film. It looks like I’m in the minority but I absolutely loved it."

There's just certain vive that only Nicholas Sparks could get across. ❤️❤️❤️|, Sim sim, meu coração está pulando de alegria, se já chorei com o livro imagine só com o filme!!|, I just can describe this movie with words... It was unexpected realistic but had this terrific wonderful end! As a romantic movie superfan and a Nicholas Sparks fan I believe it is the BEST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. And believe me I am not exaggerating... Just WATCH it💜|, I give this movie 5 stars! And Teresa Palmer and Benjamin Walker were perfect for the roles!  They both gave a great performance. Bravo!  Anyone who is looking for a really good movie that will keep you hanging on til the last scene will love this too! Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful author! I love his books and movies.|, This movie is gorgeous.The story, the setting, the people. I smiled the whole time before the Turing point and I cried when she said he was breathing for her… 😊😊😊 love this movie.|, How brilliant ! Everything about the movie was marvelous . The ending was pretty much unpredictable , with that being sad the storyline was heartbreaking . 
 Real love never dies .|, This was such a great movie, and I love that they went with all (mostly) unknown actors for the starring roles. Each of them was fabulous in their own right.|, Nicholas Sparks é mesmo um autor incrível 😍|, I was surprise when i finished the movie! it was really good, the chemistry between Gabby and Travis is amazing I loved it! <3|, Me and my boyfriend seen this on valentines day it literally had me balling this is such an amazing movie and that is very heart warming and also sad at one point i love it as much as the notebook amazing movie honestly!"
The Circle,The Circle [With Lyrics] (Bedman? Theme) - Guilty Gear Strive OST,qU6CKLe3q24,1590945,19368,1132,"Radiant light: *Seen*
Beautiful chant: *Heard*
Tender warmth: *Felt*
Ten billion years: *Consumed* (in an instant)
Me: *By your side*
Also me: *On the border of the CIRCLE*|, every Guilty Gear theme sounds weird when you first listen to it but they always grow on you overtime|, Naoki has confirmed that it's not ""Come to me ten billion years in an instant"" but ""*Consuming* ten billion years in an instant"" which makes more sense to me.|, I noticed that in Guilty Gear whenever a character dies and gets brought back, they usually are only have strong emotions for one specific person. Zato can only feel around Millia, S-Ko is STILL haunting Zappa, and now Bedman literally can’t do anything else but protect Delilah. 

Bedman spent all of Xrd trying to create a perfect world, but when he actually got a chance to go to Heaven, he chose to stick around in a broken busted up bed to protect his sister.|, 3:13 

This entire sequence is genuinely heartwrenching, and it puts the entire song together PERFECTLY.

It fits the ordeal Bedman is going through, being too damn brotherly to die|, Strive’s soundtrack really emphasizes the advantage of using lyrical tracks for character themes as a way to convey their stories. Naoki and Aisha keep killing it every single time!|, this is a funeral song for a brother who has a determination to protect his sister so strong that death itself won’t stop him|, This feels like the flipside of Drift and it's great for it. Chaos saw both sides of existence and said ""screw it, I'm gonna enjoy myself.""
Bedman saw it and found pure empty terror.|, I love almost every song in Strive, but The Circle combines awesome music with one of my favourite motives in fiction: (un)death. Clinging to a part of one's humanity, but not being exactly here, on the verge of madness and chained by something eldritch. And yet that piece of soul still driven by something precious in the mortal world, a task too important to abandon even despite the death itself.|, Finally...
I can sleep peacefully after knowing the lyrics."

An amazing action thriller that would put you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Liam Neeson at its absolute best.|, I swear almost every Liam Neeson action movie consists of him running around with a phone to his ear. A phone call with him has to be an intense experience.|, Now that's a movie trailer. Tells us enough to be intrigued without giving away any plot twists.|, Great movie! Kept me on my toes all the time. I wondered if the main character had gone mad or not. And who is really to blame struck me of course.

Outstanding performance by all depts like screenplay, directions, acting etc..|, Its all fun and games till you see, ""Based on a true story"".|, Me: Can’t wait to watch this movie!
Movie: *based on a true story*
Me: Susan, can you pass me that cross please?|, I saw The Conjuring 8 years ago on the big screen. It’s the only movie that has ever made me cry out of genuine fear. It stuck with me for months, years actually. I still lift my legs up at night in bed (if you’ve seen the film you know which scene I’m talking about). When I love a horror movie, I can usually watch it over and over. Not this one. I decided to watch it again this month for the first time since 2013. It was just as terrifying. I’ve officially put this movie to rest. Thank you James Wan for this masterpiece. 10/10 👏|, Am I the only one who was scared for the dog? He tried to warn them 🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️|, One of the best horror movies ever.|, I hate most modern horror films, but this one was definitely enjoyable. None of those gimmicky CGI monsters, which I absolutely hate. It seemed authentic and not over-done. Great acting, too- especially from the woman who plays the mother. I'd watch again... 👍|, I actually watched this alone (my mom left town for the weekend) at 3am in my apartment with every single light off. Used headphones at 100% volume as well. Absolutely incredible experience. The people who made this film are all world class."

Whilst the horror scenes & jumpscares are great (beautifully shot too!) I didn’t really enjoy the backstory so much. It could have been more substantial, deep and terrifying in my opinion. 
But the acting, the sets, the script, the filmography are 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 What do you guys think?|, ""The court accepts the existence of God every time a witness swears to tell the truth.

The Contractor,THE CONTRACTOR | Official Trailer | Paramount Movies,e7glvM8Xh0w,7120663,28938,891,"This movie is so much better than the trailer makes it look. I was genuinely surprised at how gripping this movie was. I came in expecting it to be okay or subpar but it was excellent. These actors really sold this, it feels like a real story. I kept pausing it and doing other stuff early in but once I reached a certain point, I could not stop watching.|, That's' a hell of a cast. Ordinarily I wouldn't pay much attention to this kind of movie, but given the people involved, I'm looking forward to it.|, I'd say this is more of an Amazon Prime level movie, and if you go in with that level of expectation then it's pretty good. Yes, it's nothing new and been done tons of times. Overall, it's a solid movie that should've been picked up by one of the streaming services. I enjoyed it for what it is. A decent thriller with some action, and solid acting. I gave it a 6.8/10.|, Well acted movie. Chris Pine can easily carry a movie and the supporting cast does a good job as well. Once again the script, in this case the story line, could've been a lot more than it is. Still a much better than average movie in this genre thanks to the actors, a solid 6.5/10.|, I just watched The Contractor. EXCELLENT. Movies today are boring but Saleh avoided all pitfalls and delivered an EXCELLENT action thriller. I hope a James Harper series comes forward from this. I want to know if the mongers move forward with the pandemic. I want to see what else is hiding in the shadows that Harper overcomes.|, Chris and Ben were excellent together in Hell or High Water. I'll watch this to see if they bring that same chemistry.|, Ben Foster is a great actor. I’m looking forward to seeing this movie with him and Chris Pine together again. I was just watching Hell or high water again before coming across this trailer. I don’t believe I’ve ever seen a movie with Ben Foster that was bad.|, Love Chris Pine and Ben Foster together! They make great action film. Looking forward to this one. Best trailer I've seen for 2022.|, Kiefer Sutherland is still kicking it and awesome acting by Ben Foster and Chris Pines. Chris Pines nailed this role.|, This film is unbelievably underrated!"
The Counselor,The Counsellor | Official Trailer #1 HD | 2013,6ML50I0mVHY,3476708,8076,1074,"This movie is simply so close to reality. No hope, no fantasy only reality. It really made me feel the hopelessness that the counselor felt at the moment in which he opened the package... This is art.|, The first time I watched this movie I wasn't sure if I really liked it or hated it. I went to watch it once again to confirm my feelings about it. And now this is one of my favorite movies. This is one of those movies which grows inside you if you give it the chance.
Only time can tell if this film will ever get the praise it really deserves. I hope so.|, I actually really dug this movie. I really loved it. It was like a Shakespearian tragedy. Michael Fassbender was excellent in the role. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. I really don't understand why so many people hated this. I hope that in a couple of years, this will become an appreciated masterpiece. The same thing happened with Taxi Driver. It gained mixed reviews back when it was released. now, it's hailed as a masterpiece. Hopefully, films like this get the same treatment.|, Who else came here from that random Natalie Dormer clip recommendation and is just hearing about this movie for the first time in 2020? Ha, life is strange... or maybe algorithms rather.|, Absolutely brilliant film,  its the first film ive seen in years that respected the viewers intelligence and imagination enough to make their own minds up about alot of aspects involving the characters and plot and didnt spoonfeed and baby walk us through every scene and story point and the end was unsettling instead of being the usual reassuring bullshit we always see, it also showed us the horror of the underworld and organised crime, the critics and alot of the audience slated this film but that happens with lots of films that are way ahead of their time. I guarantee that in years to come this will be noted as a classic. Cant wait to watch it again|, The movie was a gift worth every penny. Loved the sweltering, subversive and seductive feel & the raw intelligence was undeniable. This was very well developed. Ridley Scott & Cormac McCarthy are among the most proficient story tellers around. Critics really reveal the fact that most people are still learning how to even comprehend movies. This movie is for grownups whom don't expect to be spoon fed every redundant plot item. |, The best film i've seen this year.  A majority of younger generations or action junkies will hate it. I think this is possibly the most frightening movie i've seen in a while. It's to real, it's to sexy, and it's way to intricate in the sense of character. That what makes it 3.5/4.0 stars.   More than ""worth watching"".|, I did find much of the dialogue to be kind of philosophical to the point of trying a little too hard but I still loved the cinematography and how it felt like you were just watching the events unfold and the characters didn't really care if you knew every detail or not. It felt like real life. Also, saying ""you just didn't get it"" is a horrible argument for why someone doesn't like something. I agree with you on that.|, this is a deep storry-telling/crime movie, its not like the exagerated fantasy with happy ending movies that many people expect nowadays... but it's more based on the reality. It's not for everyone to understand it and like it. I loved this movie and hope for a second part.|, In some years somebody is gonna bring up that movie again and everybody is going to be like: ""omg what a masterpiece how did people not like the movie back then??"" 

 I personally think that this is Ridley Scott's best movie to date."

I really hope it does well so more originals like this will be made.|, I saw this film tonight and absolutely loved it. It feels like a film like The Arrival where it's sci-fi but it feels and looks realistic. It definitely borrows tropes from films like Blade Runner and Avatar . Highly recommend.|, There was so much thought put into this movie it was just enough of everything he wanted to showcase the world and he achieved it 100% it definitely hits what is going on with the current events and what could go down.

Over all, very interesting movie, 👍👍👍|, never have I jumped of my seat of joy and cried so many times while watching a movie, truly a masterpiece.|, This looks incredible 😭
SO refreshing.|, Man, saw this movie today and I cant shake this feeling off that you get after watching a good movie. Such an underrated movie that people are not giving this a chance. I'm in love with the story telling. Still thinking bout this movie's ending even now.|, I watched this 2 days ago in my local cinema.  When the final scene came to an end and the credits started rolling , we all sat in silence. I have never experienced that before in my 19 years , everyone who watched the movie was still present when the music credits rolled and 1 person left a bit after. The silence was palpable. tears were shed. this is definitely a movie to remember and will win many awards and go down in history.|, Just finished watching the movie i got goosebumps all through the movie...but It had me in tears at the end but a happy tears 🥺🥺🥺....

I would always think my cousins would just be playing around to make me scared. But after one night of going out in Mexico, I kept hearing a crying noise. It was about 3:45am. She kept crying, howling almost. I thought it was the brakes of the big rigs but I knew it was in fact a woman. It legit sounded like she had surround sound throughout the sky. Shit was unreal. Mexico man. Gotta love it 😅|, 2019:the curse of la llorona
2020:the curse of la corona|, Esta leyenda toma mayor importancia en los días 1 y 2  de noviembre que es cuando se conmemora el Día de Muertos en México, pues se dice que en una ocasión un hombre muy desdichado que acababa de perder a un familiar muy cercano quiso comprobar lo que mucha gente decía.

Decidido por volver a ver a quién había pasado al otro mundo, colocó una bella ofrenda, pues sabía que en esas fechas los difuntos visitaban a sus familiares que aún vivían.

El hombre consiguió un perro, le frotó los ojos para quitarle las lagañas y posteriormente se las untó él (se dice que los perros tienen un sexto sentido el cual hace que puedan ver los espíritus de gente muerta). 

Se comenta que el hombre poco a poco vio cómo sus familiares muertos entraban a su casa a visitar la ofrenda y fue su hermana fallecida quien le reclamó por haber hecho eso, pues ahora su deber era llevarlo con ella.

La gente del pueblo que sabía lo que el hombre había hecho se encontraba muy preocupada, pues en varios días no supieron nada de el, por lo que decidieron ir a buscarlo a su casa.

Para su sorpresa, lo encontraron en un rincón de su habitación en posición fetal, muerto y con una cara espeluznante de horror.|, I’m so convinced this is the wedding dress that Ed and Lorraine have in their spooky room|, “SHE WANTS YOUR CHILDREN”

*law and order: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT*|, I’m not usually a fan of horror movies, but I went and saw this the day it came out in theaters, and it was awesome! Definitely a must see!|, In 2019 a Canadian cinema accidentally played this instead of detective pikachu. Needless to say the children were terrified.|, This movie was awesome, period! I think the ones who dislike or say it was not satisfying are just into blood and guts being spilled almost every 5 to 10 minutes. How can you not like this flick.

The Cursed,The Cursed Trailer #1 (2022) | Movieclips Trailers,xAt7DMP7mWA,1356109,10456,667,"Watched it a few days ago. And wow . . . what a well-executed, polished, satisfying film. THIS is how you do low-budget horror but make it feel grand and look much more expensive. Strong script, artful direction, riveting performances, genuine suspense, and a resonant emotional core that makes you actually CARE what’s happening on screen. Fantastic interpretation of a “werewolf” movie without actually being one.

I see so much empty, pointless trash in the horror genre these days that catching something like this feels like finding a little treasure. I really enjoyed this movie.|, Just finished it. What a great movie. The fact they tied in The Beast of Gévaudan makes this movie that much better. This is how you do horror.|, Its not a traditional werewolf movie but it gets many things right where most fails. 
It has good atmosphere, good pacing and decent light effects. 
I would love to see similar horrors in 2022|, This is indeed one of the best horror films.  Unlike cheap ones with jump scares like paranormal activity franchise.  I like how the trailer puts a lot of stuff in it without telling you much, kinda like Parasites, coz most trailers literally put the whole movie in it.|, This movie was INCREDIBLE!!!! It grabs you and won’t let go and the gut punch at the end is well earned. I love Boyd Holbrook and this movie is just fantastic!! Worth the 20 bucks !!!!|, Just watched this movie and I can honestly say it is a very well-done horror movie that held my interest from beginning to end. I highly recommend this one.|, A really good horror movie. One of the best I saw and I saw a lot! The raving reviews are not exaggerated. The beauty of the scenes, the dark atmosphere, the settings, the old beliefs, the curses...Brilliant!|, Saw it over the weekend. I'm a horror buff, it was pretty badass. Done really well. Gypsies, Curses, & Werewolves....can't go wrong there!|, Easily one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time.|, Phenomenal film. Way better than I thought it would be"

Great writing.|, Not your typical Jack Black comedy movie, this is something deep and emotional.|, It has been so long since Jack was in a proper movie. He disappeared for a while, touring with his band and spending time with family. It was a good career move too, nothing worse than over exposure. Looking forward to this one|, Didnt expect this movie to be this good! loved it|, I had no idea what to expect when I watched this movie, great plot twist lol|, such a fun movie where i knew what was going to happen but was still surprised by how they happened and the acting was nice and the writing was straight forward not some complex oscar worthy writing but just fun|, Hey, looks like a funny movie!! I will watch it for sure!! Looking forward to it!! :)|, is it just me, or is jack black lookin more and more like peter griffin every day?|, I don’t know why I have never watched this movie. Because these two actors, are one of the best out there, and I have watched so many of their comedies, drama’s, and romantic movies. I BELIVE I was getting a divorce when this was going on back at that time frame, and I had no cable, nor wifi at that time….and I survived! Anyway, I watched this movie tonight, on a movie app I found on my new tv. What an amazing movie! This was like Brokeback Mountain? But way, less boring. And that movie had amazing actors as well, it was just a slow movie, and I get that. This movie was inspiring. Because I went through someone similar after my divorce, I dove into a relationship, head on, no boundaries, just, like, the YES man, movie. I said yes…..to everything, except, the harder, horrific drugs, that I will always be wondering why people go into that direction, but I know they did, because they were lost. I was lost, and it nearly broke me, I lost everything. Then, I gained it all back. I am in a good place now. From the darkness, came something beautiful. Love always wins.|, Believe me guys, this film is incredibly innovative.."

I also liked that she didn’t change herself, she just became confident enough to be herself unapolegetically—horrible party flannel included|, As someone whose basically seen ALL the chick flicks and knows ALL the storylines, this was one of the good ones.  Funny, relatable and caught me in the feels.  Yeah you can predict the ending, but the way it was done and the funny dialogue is what counts.|, I mean it was a cliche movie and everything that you'd expect to happen did happen, but tbh the actors of the movie (Mae Whitman in particular) was such a great lead, the chemistry between the main pairing seemed legit and not forced at all, and the dialogue was hilarious, so it's pretty entertaining. Its a good movie to watch if you just wanna watch something on a Friday night to be entertained lol|, why is prom the climax of every high school movie?|, I just watched the movie and in the ending where Bianca gave that whole talk/rant to Bella Thorne during homecoming in the movie was actually really inspiring, love this movie! :)|, Hands down my favorite movie of all time!!! It had me smile during the whole movie. I cried for some sad parts but also had tears of joy. This is the only movie that's ever made me smile till my cheeks hurt and laugh till my stomach hurt. But I'd give this movie a 10000000000000000000/10. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who doesn't know if they should see it or not. It's probably the top 5 funniest comedy movies😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂|, haha i wonder how the casting went for that. ""yeah we're looking for an ugly chick but not too ugly cause you know its hollywood""|, So this is where Ronnie went after he died ... poor Caitlin ..she is still mourning for him|, I already know how this is going to end: he helps her, they fall in love, then her first crush starts to like her but she chooses Wes. Cliché.|, The DUFF is not just another ""high school movie"" it is something more. ""The DUFF"" is on my ""Best Movies"" list<3"

The Dark Tower,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),GjwfqXTebIY,29778866,146699,18896,"The true genius of The Dark Tower series is how it literally ties together like half of all the King novels ever written.  Characters from The Stand (including King's favorite go to bad guy Randall Flagg), Hearts in Atlantis, Salem's Lot etc etc. are included throughout the seven novels.  An absolutely genius move on King's part financially, since to truly get the full force of the Dark Tower, you really did have to go back and read all of his older work that led up to this.|, After hearing so many bad things about this movie, I went into it thinking I was going to be disappointed. I ACTUALLY LOVE THIS SO MUCH! Awesome movie, with awesome actors <3|, Everything I've watched with Idris Elba has been great. His characters are always intense which raises the level of the movie.|, Such great casting and visuals.  Most of the action scenes were fantastic.  This film had potential.  I just wish they had given the actual story more time.
Here's hoping Mike Flanagan's take on the Dark Tower does better.|, Just saw this movie yesterday! Satisfying to watch if you enjoy good action and making commentary with your friends.|, every now and then I come back here to remember what a great movie this could have been|, This could honestly have been the next Game Of Thrones if it had been made into a TV series.  Trying to fit 7 books into one film is the same as making all the Harry Potter books into a single movie..... it can't be done.  Mr King spent over 20 years writing the main story line in this series and it deserves more than a rushed 2+ hour film.|, I have never read the books but i found this movie very interesting and it makes me want to read the books. this is a pretty good movie. the story is good, the acting is good and the directing is good. this is a enjoyable movie to watch i always enjoy movies based on stephen king books. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. this movie is cinematastic rating 5/5|, The dark tower movie and my thoughts:  I had never read the books, but I do like Mr. Kings works.  Coming from that perspective, I found the movie great.... It has great ""pair-off"" actors from children to adults who brought everything to tell of a story of good and evil.  I truly found the action fantastic and I saw the hard work that went into creating this story in such a short amount of time.  It seems to me a story like this should have started from the beginning or from the end back to the beginning.  Can't wait see the Dark Tower sequel.|, Absolutely love this movie. Highly entertaining, thrilling, action packed💯 This is one of Stephens best works but unrated by a lot of critics. Gosh I really wish there could be a second part or more."

*Red* Is for those who can control fire.
*Yellow*  is for those who can control electricity.
*Blue*  is for those can  move things with their minds
*Green*  is for those who are highly intelligent.
In this Movie our dear Ruby (the female lead) will disguise herself as being Green so she can hide who she truly is. Which takes us to our final and most powerful ability.
*Orange*  The power to control emotions, thoughts, memories. The power to control people's mind. 
Edit: I've read the books and they are amazing, hopefully this movie will do it justice.|, It kinda scary knowing that if this were to ever happen. This would be the most likely thing that humans would do to other humans. After all, our government is a dramatic queen.|, What’s crazy about being an orange is since you have mind control you can control all of the other kids and use their powers by controlling them for your own gain. By being an orange you can be all of the colors!!!!!|, The darkest minds 2.... Please
Anyone wants to see second part... Like it|, a phenomenal book! I wasn't all too into these weird powers and stuff, but got so involved with the characters there was multiple points while reading quietly where I gasped out loud or started crying. I usually don't end up watching movies that I've read the book to, because the movies are usually extremely different. I can already spot some major differences just from this trailer. I think I might risk watching it though, and hope I don't forget what actually happened in the book.|, Legends say that Lady Jane is still walking in that forest.|, ""The more that I try to control it the more damage I do""
Okay Elsa I get you|, I just came back from watching this at the cinema, and I was literally almost in tears. This movie was amazing, too.|, I finished the novel recently and am proud that this adaptation followed the book quite close minus a few deviations. Would love to see the rest of the series presented on screen, which of course would involve new actors playing the main characters who are the right ages. Still, the cast is great and Amandla Stenberg perfect as Ruby!|, This movie is so underrated! Must watch, love this movie"

LEGENDARY|, My wife and I entered our wedding reception to this song- it totally kicks butt and got the party started right away.  It's been pure bliss ever since|, I hated this as a young punk kid, thought it was pretentious and weird, now I know I couldn't be more wrong. Absolute GOLD rock and roll.|, This has honestly got to be one of the greatest songs ever written and released. You simply cannot tell me something better. Face melting riffs, huge chorus, the solo is a ripper, the ending riff explodes. It’s got everything. Best song since 2000s for sure up|, Remembering when I convinced my youth pastor somehow that this was a Christian song and we actually got to play it at church. I don’t know how I’ve gotten through life honestly...|, Heard this song on the Panda Express commercial and it brought me back to when it first came out.  Released in 2003, takes me back to the 80's and I love it.|, So weird to me that a song that sounded so old came out when I was a kid. I played it for my mom back then because it sounded like the music she played and she loved it. One of the best moments ever.|, I heard it for the first time on Mtv when I was 10 years old and I thought they were absolutely insane.
20 years later,  I’m also insane and I still love them 🖤❤️"

Sturgill Simpson is literally one of the best musicians I’ve ever heard in my entire life. Absolutely love him!!|, I don’t care wether he is doing County, Bluegrass or sounds like 70’s Jam Band. Everything this man puts out is awesome.|, I love how the movie was practically just one long music video for this song. It was weird and all over the place but a very unique and funny idea for a film 😂|, So glad this showed up on Netflix. 
Beautiful song.
Brilliant movie.|, This song is all anyone needs to survive the zombie apocalypse!|, ""Why does this song sound so familiar?""

""It's the theme song.""|, Cliff: ""You said this was gonna end badly, how did you know?""

Get hyped for it.|, I cant tell what genre this is supposed to be but im hooked|, As always A24 films NEVER disappoint, This is as good as Pulp Fiction in my opinion. I'm a fan of A24 and can't wait for the next film you guys put out. Funny, funny film. Well done cast and crew!!|, A24 grabs me by the face everytime.

The Death of Louis XIV,The Death of Louis XIV | Trailer | New Release,BzfNF1t5DTk,141751,941,81,"It is a slow burning type of film, and filmed in only 2 and a half weeks, you'd see only mostly the bed chamber, so don't expect glamour. With an excellent casts, it captures the intensity and suffering of this great King of France in his last days. Reminds us all that we are all human and we cannot escape death, no one!|, included in my personal list of most challenging to watch but to be fair, the movie is about the slow death of Louis XIV and i think Albert Serra has perfectly captured that premise|, A wasting away. Clock ticking, birds singing, lights changing slightly from day to night. ...until the final redemption. Atmospheric and uneventful. I like it.
 I find the figure and circumstances of the charlatan, who will be a scapegoat and potential perpetrator, very interesting.|, Brian May's French pronunciation is excellent.|, Louis XIV's courtiers were not allowed to knock on his door. They had to grow a nail on their finger very long and scratch the door, so that he knew there was someone (a courtier) at the door.

Loved every minute of it.|, A comedy that’s more factually accurate than shows on the history channel.|, I watched this film recently on Netflix.  I have read the biography of Stalin and the events after his death.  Although a thoroughly entertaining satirical comment, and putting aside typical poetic licence, it was pretty accurate to events.  However I found the dialogue between the characters so riveting and absorbing that I watched the movie 4 times in the course of a week.  Never come close to this before.  Incredibly well composed and acted.|, As someone who grew up in the USSR, I think it is absolutely the best and the most righteous representation of those political clowns in history. Remembering them with fear is too much of an honor for them because for some it might border a wicked admiration. They were ugly idiotic clowns who deserve nothing more than just a loud laugh at their grotesque stupidity. Bravo, Iannucci!|, ""You're not even a person you're a testicle!""


That had me weak! 😂😂|, One death is a tragedy, a million deaths are a statistic...


Stalin's death was hilarious.|, This trailer portrays the movie as slapstick comedy but it is actually much smarter than that. It is in fact a very well written and very well acted black comedy that has a very real suspense in the air right up to the end. It is only based on truth as some scenes really happened and others are altered for cinematic convenience but overall its a brilliant movie. Just watch out for  Jason Isaacs as the no nonsense Georgy Zhukov. so bloody funny|, This movie is hilarious, but it's also creatively brilliant. ""Let's do a British comedy about the aftermath of Stalin's death in Russia"" is such weird idea for a movie, but damn if it didn't work brilliantly.|, ""YOU'RE NOT EVEN A PERSON, YOU'RE A TESTICLE""

At first I was confused, but it's one of those movies you have to stay with because it all comes together. I think every family has some dysfunction, passed down from one generation to the next. Hopefully, we learn, and we get better with each generation. The cast is fantastic. 
It's clear how Michael turned out the way he did. His mother never made him accountable for his actions.|, Somebody will always end up hurt. How come I never heard of this flick before?.  Intense, moving, beautifully done.|, This film is well worth the watch.  The acting is excellent throughout and the setting contrasts the class and order of the restaurant with the chaos and savagery that is always hiding in the background.  We see flashes of it.  Paul’s description of the family as apes and hominids has a deeper meaning, as we will learn.
This film is about many things: mental illness, dehumanization, upper middle class people and the coveted notion of a ""happy family"".  
It shines a light on the moral elitism of those who believe they can decide that some lives are worth more than others. The entitlement of some people to do as they please, regardless of the consequences.  
No matter how you see the ending of this film, it becomes clear that the family will be affected forever.|, I respect the role Richard Gear portrays. Those boys were gleeful to hurt a human.|, Very intense complex - very well acted/portrayed movie- meta- phoric in it,s scope. Excellent visual resolution as well. Thank you very much for providing!!|, Richard Gere has always been not only a great actor but very very handsome as well! ❤|, This movie had moments of very dark humor but overall was a quite unsettling story. Steve Coogan  gives a rather impressive performance.|, Oh the irony of a politician being the only human being with a moral backbone.|, WOW.....this is like an expose` that goes to the very core of the DNA of the human condition on so many levels.  What a superb performance by these actors  !!|, This just reminds us that most people are not fit to be parents. That there would be any question but that they should admit to what they did and pay their consequences for murdering a human being. What kind of adult do they become after this? They learn nothing. They will spend their lives doing what they want, be bullies, look down at others they perceive to be of no value. No morals. It sickens me to know that most parents would even question but what should be done. I am a parent and had to face terrible things my sons did, but they always had to deal with their choices. Those are the ones who grow up to be politician's that hurt humanity and never are held accountable.'"

When Tommy sees what people think of his movie. With a mindset like that to chase your dreams, I’d support him no matter how bad his movie is.|, This film was surprisingly phenomenal! This is honestly a underrated masterpiece. Everyone in it did a amazing job, especially James and Dave Franco as Tommy and Greg. The thing I always think is best about this movie is that you didn't see James or Dave, you saw Tommy and Greg. Seriously, this film should've been at least nominated.|, Because chasing absurd and impossible dreams can make your failure so huge, it actually becomes a success.

What's SO unbelievable is  that BMA expects the rest of the world to believe the outcome (jailing those responsible) of the ""internal investigation"".|, I don't think it's just the shocking diabolical crime that's touching so many hearts.

The disgraceful regime who participated in Jamal Khashoggi's death are guilty without doubt. I cannot believe that no sanctions have been brought against Saudi Arabia. Truly a horrendous and despicable crime.|, Incredible film by Bryan Fogel.

I didn't know much about it. I had vaguely heard the story when it happened. 
This was really a great movie, and a wonderful tribute to Khashoggi. 
Really mind blowing that this happened.|, Everyone should see this movie to understand what happens to true reforms, justice and freedom seekers in the Arabic worlds. The killing of Jamal is the killing of the free voice of the Arabs and an attempt to silence the free ones who fought for freedom since the Arabic Spring started in 2011.

As a former New Yorker, (❤) What a powerful revival to NYC in God's timing. There were 10 powerful God lifting sons and daughters in that theater room. But God. We walked out like one Holy Ghost family laughing and praising Jesus ... The way of the days ahead. I want that more than ever and hope that every viewer of Times Square and Dominion Revival will grow hungry for more of this movement .🔥🔥🙏🇮🇱🇺🇸|, Please make it available in Australia 🙏🙏🙏🙏
We need revival here! 
Thank you Pastor Mike|, Oh my Lord!!! This is sooo powerful!! Ty you all who made this and I can’t wait to see it!! Love you all!! ♥️🔥♥️|, 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭 as soon as this started playing the Holy Spirit dropped so heavy! I cannot wait to see this and support the film. God is doing a new thing and He needs us to hang on because whatever this is, it’s coming quick!😬🙏|, This is amazing!! Praise God! I am so blessed to be alive during this incredible time!|, Yes I am very excited…my church v1 and my Pastor.I remember people last year criticizing Pastor Mike for traveling from NY, other states, London and Canada preaching the same gospel message of repentance and revival.
I was blessed to be in Pensacola, Fl where revival took place years ago.
It is not just a movie to go see but people will be saved and delivered.|, It was amazing!!! I just came out of the theater and people from waterford CT movie theater gave their life to jesus!!👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏼🙌🏼 To God all the Glory!"
The Drop,"The Drop Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini Movie HD",Iy_ogNiryZ8,7582342,24062,905,"An extremely underrated and engrossing film, with great performances by so many actors. I must have watched it on cable half a dozen times and never tired of seeing it. Miss you, James..... and, Tom, you dominate the screen every scene you’re in. Worth your time, no doubt.|, This was an amazing movie. Great acting, great writing, great everything.|, Such a great film.  Very gritty.  All the performances were incredible, but this is one of Tom Hardy's most complex characters.  He absolutely killed this.|, If you are a Tom Hardy fan and you haven't seen Locke you are really missing one of the most brilliant performances on film.|, And no comment about James Gandolfini? The man was a legend who will always be missed. 

R.I.P James Gandolfini.|, This is in my top 5 fave of all time. This movie is unbelievable. The storyline was amazing|, Tom Hardy is a great actor and this was one of his finest roles. And James Gandolfini was excellent in this role.  Gone way too soon.|, Such a good movie! I cant believe I'm just seeing it now. Its starts slow but the tension keeps building up gradually and it took me by surprise.|, Its James Gandolfini's last movie. He was a great actor and an amazing man. Rest in peace big man!|, James Gandolfini, we miss you. You were truly an amazing actor and man. Every role you played, you slayed 👏 RIP, pal ❤️"

This is what happen when you respect art in its purest forms. Nothing extraordinary or trying too hard. It's just telling what its supposed to tell. Thank God they decided to adapt all of Aaron Falks novels with the same crew.|, I loved the ending, so carefully written to present not only conclusions to two stories but their intersections, where the real drama is|, Very good movie .From the beginning to the end ,the atmosphere the motion picture ,the mystery all the actors and of course the return of Eric Bana we all expected .|, The cinematography is fantastic. Many thanks Eric Bana taking time out from his international commitments to do a local production. A simple plot sure enough but thoroughly enjoyed it.|, This film was INSANELY good, can only imagine how the book must be|, Just watched it. Very nice movie it has a very similar theme to True Detective 1 but not as dark. A multi layer story with great acting and setting(u can feel the vibe of the small rual town). The movie started with an open question then another then another. The ending was very satisfying. Over all one of the best movies I've watched this year. Umm also, Eric Bana is one a hell of an actor. Solid dude , hope to see him in more roles|, Eric Bana is awesome ever since I first saw him in black hawk down as a kid he’s in my top 5 actors. About to watch right now|, Loved the acting, the beautiful landscape opening scenes. Very enjoyable. Perfect film to shoot during a pandemic im thinking too :)|, Basically what OrabitsMadness has said, but as an Australian this is an Amazing movie, I was initially apprehensive of our film industry's track record but this blew me away, utterly riveting and comprehensive thriller that will keep you guessing until the conclusion, saw it two times and can't wait to watch it from blu ray at home again. Great unique cast, (I find personally in Australia they cast the same actors in things repeatedly when there is clearly so much talent around) Great setting, chilling soundtrack and very faithful to its source material.|, Eric Bana is under rated"
The Duelist,the duellists (1977) - second duel,l2KWTEhyVX8,3176884,21245,2241,"And the actual duel lasts for like 3 seconds. Masterpiece|, I like how when he looked at the damage of his wound he whimpered, a very natural and human reaction and more believable than the Johnny Badass of most action movies that has a entire arm missing yet doesn’t bat a eye.|, For some absurd reason, seeing that man suddenly feeling the urge to sneeze at a rapier duel feels strangely relatable, somehow.|, I appreciate the lack of background score music during the actual swordfight.  It adds a great deal of tension to the scene.  Sometimes less is more.|, As an actual sport fencer training with the Italian National team, I can say that this is the best movie dueling scene I ever saw. 
In actual dueling to draw blood or make a touch, things don’t last very long. Best fencing scene ever!|, Always loved the sheep in this scene. They must have been paid acting sheep that were told (and understood) they were playing sheep at the turn of the 19th century... when sword duels were almost obsolete, but still not that much of a rare occurrence for them to witness. They seem to have taken their direction very seriously. I say this because, every time myself and a friend went for a spot of duelling in the fields with sticks - circa 1984-5 when we were 9 or 10 - the sheep would scatter with remarkable speed every time.|, Every scene in this film is like a living painting.|, I loved this because it really showed just how fast real sword fights are.|, People like to throw around the whole 'honour' aspect of duelling but the real issue with it was that a small subset of duellists (who were likely psychotic) always ended up getting really fucking good and would game the honour system by deliberately setting up numerous petty feuds against less experienced swordsmen whilst actively avoiding their more experienced counterparts so they could rack up higher kill counts. 

All it achieved was alot of dead bodies with no benefit to society at all.|, This movie is one of those things that I just can't explain why I like so much. If I was to show this to family or friends, they would likely be bored to tears, and admittedly, it isn't particularly that exciting and can be a little hard to follow at times, but to me, it's just a really good film."

Incredible event|, Saw this at Monmouth University last night as part of understanding girls who choose a new way of being in a Women, Power, Identity series; absolutely Magnificent! Brilliant cinematography & her true story and that of her fine father will warm your heart and soul. Not to be missed 10 stars|, Wonderfull film, especially the junction between father and daughter trough the transmission of familys values and  traditions|, Saw this at the Dubai Film Festival and it was spectacular! If you have the chance please go see it, Aisholpan is an inspirational little girl who will bring you to tears!|, I just saw the full film - it's really amazing, and if for some reason the main story doesn't do it for you, the drone footage of the steppes and the eagles hunting foxes is worth watching the movie for.

But the main story is pretty great (and also a useful reality check if your kid tells you ""it's too cold"" to go outside and the temperature is above -40 degrees|, I saw this in theaters years ago and it inspired me--Mongolia became top country on my travel list. I am happy to say I am now making plans to travel to Mongolia in December 2020!|, Disney should definetly make a movie about this warrior girl after moana|, what a cool looking movie. I have always been fascinated by Mongolia, it just seems so exotic. I've always wanted to visit. This seems to be an amazing story and amazing visuals. I'll have to see this film.|, What a wonderful example to girls everywhere <3 Can't help but think she'd make an awesome Disney princess so little girls could aspire to be as fearless and strong as her."
The East,The East - Official Trailer,kJza8T9_EiE,215685,1230,180,"this movie, overall, if you expect somekind of rough battlefield thing, I warn you: It's not. It tells you a lot about the main character and what surrounds him during that time. For me it's not that dark, but it has such a depressing ending despite all that great sceneries, music, and even everyone in this film did their best for every details of it. That just proof how good this film is. Amazing!|, Found this by accident on a streaming service and it did not disappoint. The character development was strong, the action sequences were nice, and the ending was phenomenal.|, Terima kasih for acknowledging the history. What a brave team to even write the script. 🧡|, Small history info - On 17 August 1945, nationalist leaders in Indonesia declared independence following the defeat of Japan in World War II. The Netherlands, which had previously occupied the country for 350 years, promptly re-invaded and spent the next four years engaged in a brutal war to reconquer its former colony. Perversely, they attempted to justify their invasion as a continuation of the WWII fight for ""democracy"" against Japanese fascism. Dutch forces were backed up by 30,000 British troops (mostly from India), and they killed up to 100,000 Indonesian fighters as well as tens of thousands of civilians, many of them in mass, summary executions. There were also conflicts within the nationalist ranks: when an Indonesian Soviet Republic was declared by socialists and communists in 1948 it was quickly suppressed by the nationalists, and its leader killed. Eventually, despite a string of military victories by the colonists, by 1949 they were forced to grant Indonesian independence.|, After the end of World War II, the peoples of Indonesia revolted against the Dutch and British colonialists. During the 1945-1949 war, Indonesia gained independence, losing about 100,000 people killed, most of whom were civilians who became victims of the butchery policy of the Dutch who tried to drown the uprising in blood, but received many years of guerrilla warfare on several islands with which they they could not do anything.|, The whole of Europe lived and lives at the expense of the former colonies.And this is the fault of the residents of these colonies themselves who did not follow the path of socialism. Only socialist republics are free from colonizers. And Indonesia, as it was a colony, has remained so.|, I have no doubt those who talked shit about this movie haven't actually seen it 🤡👍🏼|, Can anyone name me the song in the end of this movie!|, im looking for american dutch colonial era movies . any recommendations ?|, Jujur bagus sekali"
The Edge of Seventeen,The Edge of Seventeen Official Trailer 1 (2016) - Hailee Steinfeld Movie,vswj96INhmo,3752323,36316,944,"Review: 

The movie is really good , it has the right percentage of humour in it and the storyline is pretty good. The main character is a relatable person which made me want to watch it even more .The acting is a great 10/10 and so is the movie. 
Could watch it all over again 100 times.
I would highly recommend watching it to all movie lovers out there!|, I cried watching this because I can relate to nadine. Being in this world and feeling like an alien in your own skin; i felt like I’ve watched my miserable self and my life flashed in front of me all throughout this movie and I realised I’m just like her minus the ending ofc. I’m not quite there yet.|, I can tell I'm going to love this movie just because of the teacher.|, Just finished watching this INCREDIBLE movie. I can’t even put into words how much I felt it! I remember being 17 and relating to all the things Nadine went through, it was the WORST. I had only one friend for almost 13 years and then one day we just stopped talking and our friendship ended (cause of a stupid reason) then I ended up being alone. I was constantly feeling lonely. I really had no one to talk to. I started to isolate myself from literally everyone cause I just couldn’t find someone who really understands me. I felt like NOBODY liked me or wanted to even talk to me. I hated EVERY SINGLE THING about myself. My voice, the way I looked, my height I HATED THEM. I was scared that people would actually see me the way I saw myself, I was really terrified. I still can’t control some of them but I can say that I’m glad I’ve improved most of my insecurities.|, Hailee Steinfeld is truly one of the most talented young actresses/performers that have emerged in the recent years. Her performances in True Grit and Ender's Game were incredible, and gave the world their first real exposure to how talented she is. For it takes someone truly talented to even outshine Jeff Bridges as ""Rooster Cogburn"".|, Just finished watching this movie. I loved this film so much. I thought it was going to be your typical teeanage film that tried too hard to be cool and hip, but it really wasn't. It was one of the most raw, emotional, and genuine movies I've seen this year. They portrayed depression so well, from having that lingering sadness inside you although you had the things which made you seem fine. I related to Nadine so much on so many things that it hurt. I cried so many times throughout this movie because it reflected a bit of my own life as well. I cannot begin to comprehend how thankful I am for this film, for how real, sad, and sweet it is. I know a lot of teenagers could benefit greatly from watching this. Watching Nadine become happy in the end and discovering more of herself did thrilling things to my heart. Although she is a fictional character, I hope all ""Nadine's"" in this world find their path of light. What a beautiful movie about friendship, family, love, and happiness.|, Anyone else noticed that when Nadine's depression began, she started wearing shoes without laces. And then, at the ending, when she started to pull herself together, she wore shoes with laces. This is a sign that she doesn't feel lazy about life anymore, she can tie her laces now. It's such a small detail, but it is extremely relatable.|, Haymitch is the best teacher! He basically helped Katniss survive the hunger games with a little bit of advice... ""Don't die""|, I loved watching this movie. I thought it would be another cliché comedy/drama movie, but I was pleasantly surprised that this move is actually very heartwarming. It's relatable and it will make you cry, but at the same time I couldn't help but laugh at the witty and quirky characters!|, This movie made me feel a crowd of emotions like one second I was cringing so hard I cried and the next I was like laughing and then I was crying again cause (not gonna spoil it) end of sentence. And then I was happy again love this movie a lot"
The Eight Hundred,The Eight Hundred Trailer #1 (2020) | Movieclips Trailers,kbikn8Q148c,881486,4619,613,"It is one of the best war films I have ever watched. I was initially very skeptical as most of Chinese films about that peroid were usually poorly made. but this one is apparently one of those few exceptional ones and I ended up watching it over and over again and being constantly moved every single time. I would suggest anyone who is interested in watching it to learn a bit of Chinese history during that era and it would help appreciate a lot of rich details being depicted in the film. hugh kudos to the director and his team!|, This movie is a good art piece.  I like the visuals of the night side of the safe zone as it then contrasts to the war torn city.

Lots of sad losses during the battles and they really let you feel for the characters at times|, this movie is something, Its not easy to keep track of the characters or remember their names but I think that is the point, they are nameless heroes nothing more, nothing left but they are defiantly each fleshed out and makes them memorable in their own way.|, My granddad was deployed as a spy for 5 years in Shanghai under the Japanese occupation, he died when I was 2 and now nobody really know his stories. Think about all the heroic stories that were lost, all the ppl who behaved like superhumen to save us but were forgotten.|, Just watched this movie, these soldiers fought like dragons! Respect to the soldiers of the 88th.|, this is a must watch movie. this moved my heart so much and all my time spent watching it is worth it.|, Just finished watching this in Shanghai and wow, just wow. Even had to hold back a tear or two. Making a trip to the warehouse this weekend. Highly recommend this movie as it's well done and a story that needs to be told.|, Amazing film. Right up there with the (Western) all-time classic war movies. A little bit of 1917, a little bit of Saving Private Ryan as well as some 300 vibes. The fact that this actually happened is crazy. Great flick.....a must watch in my opinion|, Amazing movie, and disclose a real story that should never be forgotten.|, My girlfriend was weeping watching this film. And so was I."
The Eight Mountains,The Eight Mountains - Official Trailer,ak4yBWxJDj8,132115,665,55,"The story, the soundtrack, the scenes, the language - everything about this movie is outstanding!
A true, simple, authentic testimony of LIFE!
Bravissimo 👏👏👏|, Loved this film:  the lifetime-spanned storyline of two friends who connect, distance, then re-connect with mountains as their catalyst. For a pensive film, it runs quite long at 147 minutes. However, the length allows for fleshing out the plot line and the two main characters in depth. The acting and cinematography are truly stunning and engaging. The music fits perfect: Daniel Norgren's style reminds me of the mellow songs of Fleet Foxes or My Morning Jacket. Bravo!|, Absolute masterpiece, saw it last night at Lincoln Center and cried my face out.|, What a wonderful film about friendship, love and loss (and so much more) this is with such beautiful acting! A gem of a movie! Thankful to have found it.|, Piękny film👌|, A wonderful movie maybe I feel it close and I can smell it because I grew up in the foothills of the Alps, a world I fled from and now that I have lived in Texas for years, I always dream of the day when I will return again to live where I grew up. I thank Paolo Cognetti the pen that gave life to this story, the very good Alessandro Borghi who fully descended into the character by concealing his Roman accent very well, which Marinelli did not do very well. All seasoned with an extraordinary and touching soundtrack, ""Come here now, you better come fast, as long as we last""|, loved the 4X3 format...what a movie!!|, I saw this movie at my local theater.  It's not perfect, but its still very good and I recommend it.|, Masterpiece|, Bellissimo"

Shows how in touch the writers of this movie are.|, Oh man, no dislikes. This movie must be a masterpiece!|, the lack of a dislike count makes this movie look like a masterpiece|, I can’t believe Sony went from making this to making Spiderman into the spider verse|, I loved the part where Gene said ""It's emojin' time"" and then emojied all over the screen|, I believe everyone intentionally looked this up to dislike it|, This movie isn’t as bad as people make it out to be, it’s actually even worse.|, Art at its finest peak. I've never seen such beauty. The animation is impeccable, the storyline phenomenal. The voice acting is second to none. The section of the film where it was just an advertisement of Just Dance is clearly the best scene of the movie and touched me deeply. I shall name my child Hi-5 as a memorial to this tear-jerking movie. I believe the soundtrack should become the anthem of the United Nations and the world. I sobbed desperately as Hi-5 almost succumbed to the dark grasps of death. This movie is superior to Shakespeare, Hitchcock, Mark Twain, Spielberg, J.K. Rowling, and Stephen King's works of literature and film. This is inspiring and heart wrenching. It will go down as one of the greatest films of all time. It has forever changed my life and exposed me to the issues of society, such as the abuse of emojis. It is 2020, and I demand a change in our government, and this movie will pave the way to a better world.|, Happy 5th birthday to the Emoji Movie. This movie is an important part of my childhood and one of the most influential events during my transition to adulthood. Words cannot describe how much this movie means to me."
The Empty Man,The Empty Man | Official Trailer | 20th Century Studios,tk6u9X1bW30,5182202,23840,3087,"This movie was one of the most creative I've seen in a very long time. Cinematography was about as good as it gets. Best way I can describe it without giving away anything: I see tons of movies in this genre, so I have a good grasp of the 5 or 6 ""model plots"" all of these movies follow. This movie has a completely different structure in the plot; kept me *very* engaged the entire time.|, This movie deserves more love. The prologue is flat-out amazing.|, Amazing movie! No other words to describe it. Amazing through and through. You'll not be disappointed if you love deep, though provoking themes with a lot of nuance and ambiguity. You need to get your brain moving and engage at all times to understand what's happening. The prologue alone is a movie within the movie. I was hooked immediately. The cinematography and sound design was spot on. Very eerie atmosphere and tone. Color grading was pitch perfect. I'm giving this a 7.5 out of 10 for the sheer boldness on display here. It's not for everyone, but if you're the type of person who enjoys strange movies, then give this a shot.|, This film is MUCH better than the trailer suggests. I urge everyone to watch it for themselves. It’s a lot more challenging and mature than it appears. Give it a chance!|, Just got out of the theater, was actually really good. Beginning sequence was one of the best opening acts I've seen in a while. Set up the movie perfectly|, One of the best psychological horror movies I've ever watched, definitely worth watching from first second till the last one. It's one of those movies where you cannot skipa single second or else you'll the miss the whole movie, it was done so creatively and the horror element wasn't mainly focused on jump scares, it was mostly psychological and that type of horror is way more terrifying. Highly recommend 9/10!|, This trailer doesn't do the movie justice *at all*. One of the better horror movies I've seen in years. Some people argue that lovecraftian horror is un-filmable by it's very nature, but I think this film pulls it off pretty well, which is super impressive to me because pretty much every other movie I've seen that tries to take a stab at this style/genre of horror usually fail miserably. 

It's not perfect by any stretch, but it is well worth your time if you like slow tension building horror films.|, This movie was awesome! People didn’t like it because they wanted a standard cliche horror movie, but this one goes outside the box. Speaking of The Box, this movie loosely reminds me of it. There are a few problems I do have with it but I think some of them will be alleviated with a second viewing. If you like cosmic/philosophical/psychological horror you will probably like this. Definitely gave me some creeps.|, The movie is actually VERY WELL MADE I’d recommend watching it the movie is also very scary and disturbing I’d recommend watching it alone at night to make it more intense and give you that feeling like something’s behind you 

Also it’s really hard to find a good horror movie these days, but this one was very well made and directed. The script was very well made, the actors are perfect, the plot is interesting overall 10/10|, One of the most creative and well-crafted horror movies I've ever seen! Don't let this trailer, the critics or the box office discourage you from watching the movie. It is _soooo_ worth it!!!! It feels like a miracle that an unusual and ambitious film like that got made, but I am so glad it was!!"
The Endless,The Endless (2017) Trailer,reMwL8uYXps,504400,1916,183,"I don't think some people realise that this movie is very much a Lovecraftian horror - ""the horror of the unknowable and incomprehensible more than gore or other elements of shock"". I absolutely love when only enough is shown and the rest is left for your imagination.|, If you have any doubt on whether or not to watch this one, rid yourself of it now. This movie is a masterpiece. It took watching it another time to fully get the whole plot, but it's absolutely genius.|, This film is waaay too underrated. I absolutely loved it and it deserves much more attention and hype than it got.|, For the people who check trailers here before watching….. the movie was ok. I was expecting it to be more horror but it served more as a suspenseful, drama thriller. It moves pretty slow in the beginning. The best part of the movie was it’s ability to build suspense through people not answering questions clearly, and making you second guess your own vision. Movies like this have a big edge when it comes to horror, because the audience is constantly thinking “What is going on?” For the case of this movie, the suspense and curiosity were there, but not enough happened. The idea of the movie is interesting. I think if you push this movie to more limits as far as violence shown, use of jumpscares and eeriness of the atmosphere, it becomes a much better movie. If you like suspense movies this is for you, but if you are looking for more horror, keep searching.|, Just finished watching this, and it was INCREDIBLE!!!! It trips just enough balls to keep you interested, without becoming a head-scratcher. A MUST SEE!!!!|, 💓 this movie.Low budget, but looks anything but.Freaky,scary,with great twists.Awesome that it co-stars the writer's,directors,and editor.
Shows what you can do,with little money, but fantastic ideas 😎

Plus, 💓  the underrated musical score by The Leaf - Which I have on vinyl record.|, Just watched this movie, and wow, it was really GOOD! Enjoyed every moment of it.|, Resolution + The Endless are two gems of such awesome class nothing comes close. Poetry in motion like never seen before in decades.|, Going to watch again this weekend. I love how Resolution is happening during The Endless. So clever what they did with time loops in this story.|, One of the best movies I've ever had the pleasure of watching"

If you love good defeating evil, this is a must see.|, ""its about a guy who's a knight in shining armor except he lives in a world where knights don't exist anymore"" truly amazing oscar worthy performance by Denzel!|, The equalizer vs John wick is way badass than batman vs superman|, this movie was really amazing, and I really like it. Denzel is the best actor and he played very well in this movie. A lot of scenes are very tensely and exciting and also there is a lot of action, and a bit of gore. This movie definitely deserves an Oscar! |, This movie went beyond my expectations its amazing and its not a typical action adventure/ shooter movie Denzel Washington was basically a hybrid of the Punisher and Batman|, One of the best movie's i ever watched...
The characters are nigh perfect, and although at some points, Robert feels a little invincible, he still looks quite vulnerable with a slight hint of bad ass mixed in (65 to 80% ._.)

If you like drama/action movies, or either of them, this is a must watch... 
P.S. Robert is like all the expendables smashed together and stripped from emotions.|, The dichotomy between the two sociopaths was well depicted. Love how they clearly identified each other in the first meeting. And goddamit Denzel...do you even know the meaning of the word suck? Cause you definitely don't dude, the man has mastered his craft...shouts to all the other actors definitely. Everyone brought it! |, The way this guy acts looks like he's really a gangster. The amount of details in his expressions are phenomenal. Washington nailed this character. This  guy is a Mike Tyson in another universe. Bro feared nothing 🗿|, Denzel Washington inhabits every character he plays, to the extent that you can almost believe he IS the character. I'm a 73-year-old lady and I can't think of another actor who can play a role with such authenticity. Paul Newman was nearly as good in some of his later-life roles, but Denzel is better."
The Equalizer 2,THE EQUALIZER 2 - Official Trailer (HD),HyNJ3UrGk_I,12797164,50469,3316,"Glad to see they've upped the action. Denzel doesn't usually do movies with this much fighting/action...he also has never done sequels before, so I definitely look forward to this.|, Denzel is to acting what an elevator is to a building.

He takes acting to another level.|, Went to see this movie yesterday, I can honestly say that this is the first time I enjoyed a sequel more than the original.
A solid 8.5/10|, i was amazed of how violent the first one was, im totally in for this one. Who doest love to see bad guys getting what they deserve?|, Denzel is a legend I hope people truly do appreciate his work cus he hasn't gotten the credit he deserves from the awards recognition...he's won before but he definitely deserve more|, This movie was intense! The action and suspense tops The Equalizer 1. Denzel and Antoine did an amazing job!|, Now we need him to team up with John Wick.|, It's how he uses the environment against them that makes the fight scenes work so well. It's almost believable that one highly skilled individual could take out 5 guys in a minute. I knew someone with skills like that many years ago. Whether with a knife, stick, or mundane objects like a ball point pen or a towel; the man was a virtuouso with an intuitive sense of how to incapacitate an opponent.|, For Denzel's first sequel, it's a slightly flawed but ultimately an entertaining ride. It'd be great to see The Equalizer 3 give the character a challenge as Robert is mostly on top of everything in the films we have so far.|, We need to preserve Denzel at all cost. He truly is an American treasure.. Please give him another Oscar before it's his time..."
The Equalizer 3,THE EQUALIZER 3 - Official Red Band Trailer (HD),19ikl8vy4zs,17277519,184988,14237,"What I always loved about these films is how he gives the evil people the chance to do the right thing and they never listen so they suffer the consequences.|, It's rare to see movies like this these days. A simple plot, only a bit of action, and yet every minute builds the atmosphere and gets you emotionally involved. You want every villain to get what they deserve and Denzel is like made for this kind of movies. He never disappoints. You see him and you just know the movie is good.|, Denzel is one of those actors -- if you see him a film, it's going to be a good movie. I bet this film is no doubt better than the first two and it's rare when a trilogy all around is great. This movie is most definitely going to have a remake in the future. They might even do a prequel film.  (The best movie franchise is 'The Matrix' in my opinion. Seeing Neo evolve with each installment, rather than it being all capitalized in one film was done amazingly well.)|, I love Denzel's nonchalant attitude in these films. His confidence is exactly the sort you need to pull off fighting off multiple people. Considering his age in the third instilment. It makes sense his defense comes as second nature.|, I just saw this last night. I need a part 4, 5, 6, 7....
I don't want it to end....Denzel is amazing and I love The Equalizer series!|, Denzel, the action star operative we didn't know we needed till we had him in these Equalizer movies. More praise and recognition is needed for these films and his performance. No crazy John Wick backflip 180's, blind-folded double tap headshots whilst being nuked by a flurry of bullets which I enjoy but this is a different caliber of movie. This franchise makes this so believable due to its simplicity and down to earth conflicts.

The final fight scene in E1, is what hooked me! The Vengeance song by Zack Hemsey went so well with that last act, gave me chills and goosebumps I have not yet forgotten.
Probably one of the best composed fight scenes in cinema history, in my opinion.|, We demand atleast 6 Parts Denzel! Give the people what they want.|, I just love Denzel Washington.

In ""Equalizer"" and ""Man On Fire"", he's portrayed the type of "" Come hell or high waters"" for you type of character for the innocent and loved ones. A balance within an individual I wish to see more of within the people of every society.

I honestly can't wait to see Equalizer 3 hopefully in theaters. Just got to get my husband cought up with E1 and E2 first.|, watched it today in the theater. it is unbelievable. love the way they show the simple beauties of slow-paced southern Italian life ❤|, The Equalizer is such a high impact movie. If three is Denzels last one, I feel they should continue the story line with the girl. She knows him better than anyone. Denzel as the equalizer puts so much passion into every scene,  it's hard to see it come to an end. Job well done!"
The Exception,The Exception | Official Trailer HD | A24,ld4eE2HU-ig,801560,3634,156,"Just finished watching this! Absolutely loved it! So unpredictable and not what I expected. Loved Lily James as well. Highly recommend this!|, Christopher Plummer is a winner no matter where he goes.|, Underrated movie. Such majestic and I love the actors it's perfect ❤️|, I loved this movie ♡|, Very educational. I never knew the Kaiser was Prussian Royalty, I suspected though. Good movie. It jumps right into the plot within half the hour from start. I enjoyed everthing about the movie, the liaison de coeur between the spy and officer, leaves some watchers bitterly angry.  Socialist Officiers were there to shut down the German Royalty. With no regard for the Prussian Tribes of their Heritage just contempt for social fascism.|, Legend Christopher Plumber was Marvelous as only he could be.|, The irony is, if the Kaiser had been allowed to keep his throne - he would *NOT* have given Hitler the emergency powers that Hindenburg did after the Reichstag fire thus making him (Hitler) absolute ruler.|, Loved this movie a must watch 8/10|, This feels odd coming from A24.   They've almost always gotten me at the very least interested in an upcoming release and the films all look like they are well crafted and offer something new to bring to the table.
This trailer feels like it could have come from any studio and the film itself looks like a dull period piece love story.  Not to mention the casting of Jai Courtney as a romantic lead?  I don't hate the guy but I have hardly ever seen him provide charisma on screen and have little faith in him convincing me on a romance.  This is the first time I've been skeptical and disinterested from A24, but I hope my first assumptions are proven wrong.|, I loved this movie 10/10"
The Exorcist: Believer,The Exorcist: Believer | Official Trailer,PIxpPMyGcpU,28906544,96413,13333,"The Exorcist was the greatest horror film ever made, it's going to be incredibly difficult to match it's raw power and shock value no matter how many jump scares are are added to the edit|, Lifelong horror fan here. I watched The original Exorcist in 1975 when I was in my early teens and I still consider it one of the scariest films ever, if not the scariest. What made it so powerful IMO was the slow buildup with a gradual incursion of evil into very real, gritty lives of people who seemed absolutely credible. The tension was rising, the setting and characters were 100% believable, so that by the time the pea soup was flying, you were all in. The problem with a lot of Hollywood horror now is that they don't take the time to build up that tension or develop the characters, and just go overboard with over-the-top, all-out explosions of supernatural phenonema in your face 15 minutes in, so that you're just numb to it.|, To have Ellen Burnstyn return to her role as Chris MacNeil 50 years later at 90 years old is incredible. So glad she signed on to this project.|, I still get chills down my spine every time I hear that theme start playing.|, For the generation Zeders and those who saw The Exorcist on VHS or Blu Ray, I saw it at the cinema. And this movie was a ground breaking horror flick which was more of an experience which I've never encountered in the cinema. Watching it was a very tight and frightening hit you in the face kind of flick, although at times my ears were getting popped by the women in the cinema screaming their lungs out which added to the atmosphere.😃

3 years ago I saw this on Netflix, and the smaller screens without the audience atmosphere doesn't do it justice. So see this as it's meant to be viewed, and you won't be disappointed.|, First watched The Exorcist with my mum. She was in the theatre when she watched it first and witnessed people throwing up, fainting etc. she decided to watch this with me one October evening while I was about 10-11 years old! One of my all time favourite films. This actually looks pretty good, and I’m excited to see it in full.|, I was a bit skeptical at first but now this movie  looks extremely promising. Looking forward to this!|, This looks absolutely great. The Exorcist is such a difficult movie to live up to in any sense be it the tv series that was made or even the movies that followed the original but I honestly thought before watching the trailer for this that they wouldn't do it justice or it wasn't going to be that great but this looks amazing. Blumhouse and A24 are really knocking it out of the park lately with their horror movies.|, I was 11 years old when I saw the original at the drive in theater with my parents and my little brother.  It was scary indeed, but thoroughly enjoyed it.|, I just watched this movie. It was spiritual and full of love, I was in tears the whole time. It wasn't scary but was a shine of light for humanity"

Thought it was a best of three and is more enjoyable because of the comedy and it never feels too serious. As an action movie it's incredible, because in an action movie, realistically you just want to see guns and explosions. This has plenty of both.|, Needs for The Expendables 4
1 - Dwayne Johnson
2 - Liam Neeson
3 - Samuel L Jackson|, Thank you Stallone for doing this, yea the movies may not have the best storyline but they are great throwback to the action movies we watched growing up in the 80\90's. Maybe the younger audience nowadays dont appreciate it, but for the rest of us, its great to see all these action hero's in one movie together. |, I like how arnold says ""get to the choppa!!"", not once but twice. And the tax evasion line by snipes was funny as well..|, I can not wait for this film! I grew up on awesome action films and am looking forward to seeing Rambo, the Terminator, and Blade team up! Also I hope this isn't the last film. I really want to see Sigourney Weaver in these films.|, I actually saw the movie yesterday, 2 weeks before it's official release and it's actually very good and in times funny. I don't like action movies anymore like I used to back in the good old days with these guys, but just for them being in this movie I give it a fair amount of credit.|, YAY I can't wait! But I want Jet Li to have more screen time. He deserves it! |, Awesome ensemble cast. It was great to see Mel break out some martial arts after a 30+ year hiatus. He resurrected the evil in Martin Riggs with this one."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye,THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures,eMMLRnXPPJk,6274023,19534,1815,"Who's here after Jessica finally won her very first Oscar??? 🙌🙌|, The minute I saw this trailer I had tears in my eyes. Tammy Faye along with Princess Diana were one of the first people on Earth who wanted to help AIDS patients with their power that they had. Tammy is iconic, and Jessica Chastain just fucked me up. Oscar worthy.|, Jessica Chastain put her heart and soul to this story since 2012. She has been holding to this figure's story rights since 2012, it wasn't until 2019 that the movie was greenlit with a director and screenwriter. This is definitely one of her most passion project and man Tammy Faye would've been so proud for her. While the Best Actress competition is extremely tough, I would be happy that Jessica win her Oscar for this movie, after all she has been long overdue|, Fantastic movie.   She did a phenomenal job of acting!!|, Jessica was amazing in this film! Definitely deserved the Oscar!|, Jessica Chastain got a well deserved oscar for this role, and after watching this film I now know why. During the film, I found myself constantly pulling for her, and that's because of how adorable and vulnerable she was.|, We were neighbors of Jim and Tammy when they were doing the ""Jim and Tammy"" childrens' show. They lived one block down from my family. My first Halloween, we went trick or treating with large, brown grocery bags that we had decorated with magic markers. It was what you did back then. As kids do, we hit up all the houses. Tammy answered the door and handed out flyers for the show. She was very sweet and complimented all the costumes, even mine, which was a witch. Then my bag broke and candy scattered all over the porch.  I started to cry, she told me to stay right there, went and got a new bag, then got down on her hands and knees, and helped me find every last piece of candy. By this time my siblings and their friends had left me behind. She asked me where I lived and when I pointed and said ""There"", she walked me  home.  She gave me a hug and told me ""Jesus loves you, and so do I"". I ran up the steps  to the door where my mom had just opened the door to go look for me. I turned around to wave, and she'd already walked away. I guess she saw my mother and knew I would be fine.

My siblings and I would go see the ""Jim and Tammy"" show, as they always wanted a live audience. That stopped after my mom picked us up and we were crying . There were some rowdy kids in the audience that night, and Jim had some sort of meltdown and told us we were all going to Hell.  Bear in mind I was about 4 at the time. When you're 4, and a preacher tells you you're going to Hell, you believe it! My mom never let us go back again, and they moved out of the neighborhood sometime later. Growing up, I never forgot his douchebaggery or her kindness. R.I.P. Tammy Fae.|, They both deserve Oscars for those performances..they both captured the nuances of Jim and Tammy...|, God I just love this. Jessica Chastain and Andrew Garfield are gonna kill it in their roles.|, Tammy had a true heart for people"
The Fabelmans,The Fabelmans | Official Trailer [HD],D1G2iLSzOe8,6158187,41981,2943,"This kid film maker has all the right ideas for a massive YouTube career, then he gets demonetized and that breaks his heart. Yeah I can totally relate to this film. Lucky Spielberg made his films well before YouTube ever appeared.|, Anyone who loves & understands art, will see themselves in this film. Too many scenes just hit too close to home. So amazing.|, I saw this movie last night and I did not expect to be so profoundly affected by it.  I loved every single moment of it.  Every now and then I'll see a movie that'll reaffirm my faith in cinema and this is one of those films.|, This film was a deeply personal experience for me, so many parallels to my life and family. Tears and reflection kept me glued to the screen for every second of the film. Steven Speilberg is a master director. This film is absolutely beautiful.|, I've been a Spielberg fan for a very long time. Jurassic Park was my first real gateway to his films, and since then it has been an everlasting obsession with his films. Steven was the reason I decided to attend film school for college, and to pursue a career in filmmaking. Though the work I do differs from cinema, I would love to do future work in storytelling. I think Spielberg was and still is a huge inspiration for filmmakers all around the world. The Fabelmans looks to be a companion piece to Super 8 with a filmmaker following his passions. I am beyond excited to see this when it hits theaters, and I dearly hope that this film brings some awards to both the cast and crew. Cannot wait|, 1:53 When Seth Rogen’s character said to Sam “If you stop making movies, it will break your mother’s heart.” That really hit me hard because I’m a film student myself. Sometimes I feel like giving up filmmaking but I know now this is my purpose to inspire audiences to tell stories on screen. Never give up despite whatever obstacle gets in the way.|, The fact that this is loosely based on Spielberg’s childhood, his love for film, and the divorce of his parents, it’s safe to say that we’re in for something incredibly special. By the looks of it, Michelle Williams could finally win an Oscar. Spielberg may finally win a second Best Picture Oscar. I’m grateful for Spielberg and everything he’s given to the world. This will be on repeat till I finally see it on the big screen.|, This movie is a gem. Visually beautiful and ethereal. I genuinely laughed and cried in many scenes. Will never forget this movie. Spielberg at his vintage best. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography took me to 1950s and 60s.|, What I love mostly about Spielberg is his way of emotionally conveying a story. Be it a blockbuster movie or an artistic one. He understand the emotional complexity of the characters and their arcs.|, Does anyone else notice how incredible Spielberg is at using the magic enthusiasm that children bring to everyday life? The joy and wonder and all the Spontaneous creativity they just do by being kids."

Really?! Did Marco get a 2nd chance? How can you bring yourself to ask that in front of the victim’s grieving family?|, My heart broke throughout that mothers victim statement. I cried as if it were my own son. I can’t imagine her pain.

That alone shows how much effort A24 put into this.|, The line ""you think one's life belongs to oneself...In the East, a person's life is a part of a whole. Family."" was what made me tear up. I cannot count how many times my father and my family have said this to me, or at least something along the lines of this, and I never really understood it as a child. How could our lives not belong to ourselves–they're OUR lives, aren't they? 
It was not until I got older that I truly understood the underlying meaning behind this sentiment. It wasn't really to be understood, but rather to be felt. All the times I was back in China, there was a feeling of wholeness–of being utterly whole and complete when I was with my family. It just felt right–when we all gathered, there was a sense of finally being home. It's something that I can't describe, but something this trailer was able to express perfectly. 
I am so excited to watch this movie–everything down to the very last detail is so accurate. The decorations in the grandma's home, everyone gathered in the kitchen and living room in slippers while grandma cooks, everything looks perfect.|, I don't think I can watch the entire movie, could barely get through this cut without crying.|, Congrats to Awkwafina for winning the Golden Globe!|, ""Based on an Actual Lie""

Meaning it's a true lie story.
That really hit home.|, The Parasite director was right during his Golden Globe speech, ""We need to see past the language and subtitles bar, so we can see a whole new world of movies"" (is not a direct quote, but the sentiment its the same)|, i don't think many people realize just how common this type of thinking is? wen my grandma's cancer was diagnosed, the entire family hid it from her, even when she was going in for chemo and had no idea what it was for. 


the fact that i get to see this story that i completely understand on the big screen? directed by a woman that looks like me? with actors and actresses that look like me? in languages that i speak? 


i think i might cry|, I was so moved by this trailer. I appreciate the fact that this trailer reflects how truly complicated family dynamics are in Asian culture. It's sometimes so hard to convey to others how tricky and complicated it can be, especially those brought up in Western culture. I'm so happy to see a film out there that explores those dynamics.|, I love when movies tell new stories. 
Especially when they explore other cultures and point of views.
It's not the race of the director that is to praise, it's her talent, her vision and her knowledge.|, That grandma's acting is amazing, makes me feel like she's my grandma"

The Father,THE FATHER | Official Trailer (2020),4TZb7YfK-JI,3919750,18178,1271,"That hits close to home. I looked after my mother and father when they declined with dementia. My mother was an angelic but forgetful saint, my father was paranoid and hostile. He had always had control in his life and saw every bit of it slipping away. As hard as it was to cope with him, it made me a better person. For the first time in my life, I had to love another person unconditionally, with no emotional reward.|, *As a person who's been around (too) many people with dementia, I am shocked by Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance: it is spot on, and by far the best depiction of dementia I've seen on camera. He really deserves his Oscar.*|, This film is less of a story and more of an experience that attempts to put the viewer in the place of someone suffering from dementia. I know a lot of people don't like how it's often difficult to understand what's happening in the movie, but I personally loved that because not knowing reality from mental fabrications made me truly feel like I myself had dementia while watching the film. Also, it makes you sympathize with old people, which all too often doesn't happen in our society. This movie is a masterpiece. That's really all I can say about it.|, I did just watch it. That last scene with the nurse is a masterpiece. Still feeling tears coming out.|, Sir Anthony Hopkins wining oscar again at the age of 83. What a legend. Its not acting its an art for him.🎩|, I watched this movie several months before my mom condition starts getting much worse and the doctor diagnose her with dementia/Alzheimer's. Great movie, pretty much the same with what I'm going through right now. Still can't believe though that I will deal with my mother having this condition one day in my life.|, It's hard to put into words how extraordinary this film is and how remarkable Anthony Hopkins is in it. It's a work of genius  that is almost operatic from humor, to drama, to pain, to horror and finally to tears. That last scene alone I was watching with my Mom and literally gasping and sobbing the whole time and it lingered with me for several days afterwards. I'm so happy that the Academy actually got this right and gave Hopkins a much overdue 2nd Oscar.|, A masterclass in directing, pacing, persective and acting while exploring an important topic|, I loved this movie. I believe that if you know someone going through this, you should watch it.
Just like many who may have shared this experience in real life, this movie (and the ending scene, particularly) left me emotionally devastated. I'm not even sure if watching this movie was a cathartic experience, or just a reliving of the emotional trauma me and my mother went through while taking care of our beloved grandmother. 

I truly wish this movie would have come out back in 2017, when things were at their worst for us, so that I could have better sympathized with her state. We went through everything the movie has shown, and Hopkins' portrayal of the disease is uncanny. He deserves recognition for it.

But nominations and acting aside, I hope this opens up more dialogue involving dementia to the public, because it is as terrible as it seems, and everyone going through this can use as much sympathy and help as they can.|, HE HAD ME IN TEARS ! Wait until he starts crying out for his ""Mommy"" ! It's gut wrenching. He's BRILLIANT ! (as usual).  A must see for anyone with elderly parents."

The Favourite,THE FAVOURITE | Official Trailer | FOX Searchlight,SYb-wkehT1g,12173709,52283,2227,"The most badass movie I’ve seen in a long time. Roller coaster of drama, slapstick, horror, and history. The audience didn’t know how to react. I’ll see this movie 10 times.|, This is not comedy. This is thriller. Ruthlessness. This was terrifying. Put yourself in Emma Stone's shoes, would you make the same moves? Giving her situation? Absolutely brilliant movie. Totally unexpected. Very real. Applies in real life.|, Usually, the movie is never as great as the trailer - there are exceptions, and this is one of them. Fabulous movie. On paper, it might sound boring, 18th Century England involving a Queen and her palace, etc. It's not boring in the slightest. Olivia Colman is going to win the Oscar - she was incredible!

Olivia Colman: Yes.|, Olivia Colman is a revelation. Such a great actress - hopefully she'll get a lot more worldwide recognition with this role.|, Olivia Colman really did deserve the Oscar.|, Loved, loved, loved this film. The story is thrilling, the costumes and characters lavish and perfectly excessive, and the mind game was so deceivingly manipulative and entertaining. Emma was superb!|, Stone, Colman and Weisz translated the roles they played with such vigour, conviction, passion and above all humor. Colman's translation of the mad and narcistic Queen Anne were so real and Stone's translation of the oh so beautiful and charming and manupalitive Abigail was hilarious at times, especially the Me Too scene in the woods. A very effective method of combating unwanted sexual intimidation, just loved it!|, I'm genuinely surprised how much I've enjoyed this film.
I usually avoid court drama, considering most of them are cheesy and lazy scripted.
But the favourite showcases how you can tell a brutal story with such a fine, witty dialogue.
the eerie violin with spooky images enhance the feeling of fear and unstable,characters get so delusional by power 
 end up crying on floor or trapped in millions of hallways.

I don't want to spoil the movie but  this is a movie is so well put together, which you dare not miss, because if you miss this one you are never going to see another. Be prepared for one last lovely beautiful and thrilling ride ahead of you, that's well worth your time and memories!|, My RESPECTS to those people who serve their country without expecting anything. These people should be taken care well instead of people who fight for medals. These are the real heroes."

If all crime was legal, I'd go steal a bunch of clothes so that I'd look fly as hell the next day.|, This movie was amazing, loved every minute of it. I see a lot of bad reviews/comments, but don’t let that hold you back to see it. It was the best purge in my opinion.|, I love this series honestly, and I'm a major critic of horror/thriller even tho it's my genre. I saw this alone and it gave me serious goosebumps, good stuff.|, ""All crime is legal for 12 hours""

Edit: I can't believe that people are still giving likes and comments after a whole year, thank you all!|, it would be terrifying if this happened in real life, but i quite like the movies honestly. i see a lot of people in the comments don’t like them and i understand why but i think they are pretty good.|, Who’s here after the purge is kinda happening irl?|, If the purge happens in real life, I’m going to the movies and watch the purge during the purge.|, I saw this movie yesterday and it was good it had plot twists and scenes that made you wanna yell at the screen, I definitely recommend if you like movies with plot twists, jump scares, and cliffhangers, and a lot of action.|, I don't agree with violence but after watching this on Netflix, I must say the story was an eye opener.|, The purge in movies: people getting enaugh food and water for 24 hours

I didn't expect it to be this good. All characters have their moment. I had to remind myself to breathe in the last 10 minutes. The animation in the end blew my mind.|, Guys, I saw this 10 times in Japan and still not enough for me. Don’t wait for Blu-ray release, you gotta see it on BIG screen!!! What a beautiful art work!!!|, Just watched this today and this was the perfect way to show off the ending that we never got in the anime. Looked like the manga jumped onto the screen. Teared up 3 times. Well worth the wait|, This might be one of the best films I've ever seen. Seriously. It blew my expectations out of the water in every way. One thing I really loved was the captivating sound design of the film. It felt like I was in the scenes, in a way I don't know how else to describe other than completely immersive. If you're on the fence about this one, give it a watch.|, Saw this last night with my hubby and it was so good! We were laughing, clapping and cheering like watching a live basketball. It was worth it! Best anime movie that I watch so far.  I've been a fan since the first anime. We are still feeling excited 😂 love love it!|, I went to the cinema out of curiousity and went back home becoming a new fan of slam dunk. Usually, anime movies wouldn't last more than a month in Vietnam, but since this one was so good, we kept on going to the cinema as many times as possible that the cinema had decided to show it for another month just to please us. It was like a battle for showings cuz we were all afraid of not being able to rewatch it. Now that the movie is no longer shown, we're still talking about it every day. Dont let the cgi in the trailer deceive you, give it a shot|, This movie went off SO GOD DAMN HARD!!!!! I feel sorry for anyone who would the opportunity to miss this on the big screen! And this is my FIRST introduction to Slam Dunk!!|, This is probably one of the most successful anime in Asia Countries, my dad watched it over five times, and I have watched it since I was a kid. If this hasn't existed, basketball won't be able to be this popular in Asia.|, I wanted to get into Slam Dunk because of the movie so I read all 31 volumes of manga now I am excited for the movie 😊|, I cried, laughed and missed them so much. I'm so glad I got to see the pre-screening for it. 
I left the pre-screening with a poster, I'll definitely will put it up on the wall or frame it.
I'm definitely seeing it again, when it officially releases, and will definitely buy the Blu-Ray for it when it comes out."

He was the most active Batman in the whole movie and his fast fighting skills were the best thing I have ever seen.|, Michael Keaton has still got it! They even brought back the 1989 Batman music theme.... Nostalgia hits hard!|, Wasn't planning to watch this till I saw Michael Keaton in the trailer. It was glorious. I like how they kept his Batman true to his original style.|, 0:22  anyone else notice when Barry and his mother are happy, the light around them is all yellow, but when his mom is murdered, the light around them is blue?

It’s crazy to see it on screen other than in my memories....i also lived with my single mom who always had men over. She struggled with drugs and alcohol...but me being a child, i still only saw the purity of it all. when i’d describe my past to people - everyone would always tell me how sad and horrible it must’ve been to live like that...but they were some of my fondest memories. i was free back then. wandering around, being a kid with no boundaries. sure, looking back - it was probably irresponsible of my mom to let me roam around...but i can never get that again. just being able to explore and enjoy life for the simple things....not responsibilities.|, i love bobby, he really cared for everyone at the motel. he always looked out for the kids no matter what. when there was a pedophile around them me confronted him. he acted like a father to hailey, even though she got mad he was doing it to protect her and moonee. he was so sweet to them and even though he was a little tough on them he still cared for them.|, the last 60 seconds of this film made me cry like a baby, simply beautiful|, This movie is the perfect example why you dont need high budget to make good movie|, Hope this movie does well. I was working at disneyworld living paycheck to paycheck in a weekly motel, and one of the saddest things were these kids and their families living there too. Thanks for spotlighting this......thanks for all the attention and likes. This is reality and needs a spotlight. Thank you very much! Please spread the word and share the truth.|, This movie is beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. I was sucked in. Incredible job.|, The world ain't ready!!!!! I screened this film a few weeks ago and I still can't shake it. Revolutionary. Never has a film so masterfully tapped into the innocence of childhood. It makes you want to turn back time. My life has been forever changed.|, This trailer was beautiful. Reminds me of my childhood growing up in Florida. Riding bikes, breaking into unlocked apartments, not realizing how poor we were. Shit was real|, Very realistic movie. Can't believe this isn't nominated for best picture. Also the young actress is incredible, holy shit. Now I have to recover from this movie, it made me depressed and sad.|, It's a powerful film that deserves to be seen, but I'm amazed that some people found it funny and heartwarming. That wasn't the mood when I saw it; the audience left in complete silence, looking shaken by what they had seen. Sensitive people will find some scenes difficult and disturbing to watch, as the doomed central characters head towards tragedy, seemingly unwilling and unable to change course."
The Fog,The Fog (1980) - Official Trailer,nOZwnivtLbc,1014128,4409,635,"I love how they made anything scary in the 80’s! From cars, fog to dogs 👏🏽|, Such a uniquely atmospheric film. Really taps into that ghostly, coastal feel. A masterpiece.|, ""The Fog""(1980) is the most atmospheric and scary movie of all time! This movie is a horror masterpiece!|, This movie scared me to death as a kid. I still love the film's spooky atmosphere and music to this day. Unfortunately, the people in the film behave so stupidly that they really deserve to be murdered by Blake‘s Crew
Rule No.1 
if there's a knock at the door at midnight and a glowing wall of fog in front of you, then always call „hello?“and march right in….
But the scene where Blake's voice is heard over the radio still gives me goosebumps|, 35 years old and still creepy as hell.  Love this movie!|, Rest in peace Hal Holbrook, 1925-2021. He was a truly magnificent character actor, who helped to make this one of my favourite horror movie's.|, Such a great film. I always felt that it was a little after its time. It was perhaps a little tame for a 1980 audience. My favourite part is the prologue with the captain telling the kids about the fog, such a great way to captivate the audience.  |, 2019 and still laughing and trembling at once 😂. John Carpenter is a legend!|, one of the greatest atmospheric horror films of all time.|, this is a awesome movie. i just realized how much i love 80's horror movies. this second movie of john carpenter's is amazing. the visual effects are great and the acting is great. who ever thought that you could make a scary movie using fog, and fog can be creepy because you don't know what is lurking out there. the story is great. there are not to many ghost stories using pirates/sailors. i liked that concept. all in all this is a great film and john carpenter is a great director. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. and the music was eerie and good for the film. rating 5/5"

Great job Jackie Chan as always!|, This movie is WAY underrated. Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan give performances of a lifetime. Taut, suspenseful and realistic script and acting. I cant stop watching this movie.|, Just finished watching this, such a great movie. It is so heartbreaking seeing Jackie Chan be so depressed and sad but at the same time its amazing seeing him give such a great performance.|, Just watched this. Was slightly hesitant as I'm picky with movies but I thoroughly enjoyed it! Definitely a mature, and somewhat dark film. You have to pay attention to it. Violence is actually fairly realist, Jackie does way better than I suspected he'd do, and by the end you're satisfied. Definitely worth watching! I love Jackie Chan and this makes me sad to see that he has aged, as he as brought so much entertainment to us over the years. Great movie!|, That scene where Jackie holding the dead daughter and crying, as a father of my beautiful daughter, I cried there.  The law and government is useless to the injustice by the system.  This is what happens when a man has lost so much in life, that when he becomes the ONLY person left in his family.  With all his family gone, the only driving force are rage and revenge.    You take the family away from a man like that, he becomes a relentless enemy.  If I had lost my family by the injustice, I would be as relentless like that too.|, I don't care if this movie isn't a 'hit' I'm just happy to see Jackie Chan back in the game.




He's a legend.|, No-one will ever come close to Jackie Chan, probably one of the greatest actors that has ever walked this earth. I'm going to see this tonight! #jackiechanforever|, Its so sad to see Jackie chan gettin old. But he still delivered it. So good movie of him. I feel like crying to see Jackie chan gettin old. I love him so much. And thanks for all the good action and entertaiment you gave us Mr. Jackie chan. I will forever love you. And i wish you will live longer to give me more motivation in my life . You are the best. Love : Gerard."

Trapped on a monster infested island, hearing gone, possibly has a concussion, and his only hope for survival are these guys.|, The fact that an A.I. companion like Kelvin is contributing a whole lot more than two human companions just makes me worry for humanity.|, Bob's red ""M"" marker and Wade's green ""L"" marker keep making me think that Mark is on the island with Mario and Luigi|, Y’all were working together so cohesively in The Forest , then we get here to Sons of the Forest and there’s pure chaos with Kelvin and Wade throwing logs, Bob screwing around with grenades, and Mark declaring war on everyone. What tf happened?|, I’m so glad Kelvin isn’t being treated like shit every other YouTuber is treating him terribly and for some reason I’ve bonded so hard with those pixels 😂 poor Kelvin is just doing his best|, Out of the trio, Mark being the one protective of Kelvin is not what I was expecting|, Mark: ""If any of you hurt Kelvin, I'm going to blow up this island with atomics""

Wade: And I took that personally|, I only realized this just now, but perhaps the reason Kelvin was confused under the helicopter was because both his eardrums have gotten ruptured and his sense of balance and direction was horribly confused at the time. If I recall correctly, our organs responsible for our sense of balance are connected to our ears. That's why getting hit on the side of the head can make a boxer's head spin into a knockdown. This is different from getting a concussion which seems to be caused by the brain ""rebounding"" inside the skull instead.|, ""Your violence was not exactly impressive to me"" is now a mark quote I will forever use"

Fire whoever wrote this line|, 2 weeks until we flatten the purge... umm actually we meant forever|, Maybe I'm alone here, but the first Purge movie was excellent. I remember watching it for the first time and I truly felt dread when watching it because while watching it I thought about the whole purge idea and if would actually work in reality. IMO the first movie is a fantastic horror/thriller because it plays on the horror aspect, up close and personal with characters we get to know, where'as all the other movies are simply characters we dont care about getting into trouble - typical popcorn movie. Such a waste of potential.|, I love all these movies, just to clarify, I would not purge... I really don't feel that Ned I guess. I also live in the middle of nowhere in a forest. Now to the point, these movies represent, to me, a weird sense of reality. Most people would love to murder others wildly. I know this, because,before I left the real world for the woods, I worked in a largely social world. This world is fucking insane, these movies capture that insanity in an amazing way. I appreciate the films, and I hope none of this ever comes to pass. Be safe folks.
P.s. sorry that was so long winded. I try to keep things short. But these films provoke slot of thought in my mind. My apologies.|, Very interesting how this movie franchise started as horror and with every installment, has slowly morphed into an action franchise.|, This was my favorite Purge movie. The fact that Americans had to immigrate to another country really showed what other immigrants who come to America may try to escape. Put's things into perspective for us Americans.|, I like how this movie tackles racism. You should not hate others just because they're not like you. I believe everyone should get along in this world especially the way everything is going. This movie is really great and had me on edge|, Man ,in every purge movie the  siren always gives me goosebumps🥶🥶.Such a dope feeling 😅"

A good thriller is exactly what we have been waiting for.|, Watched in a packed theatre. I heard the people eating popcorn and some guy nervously tapping his foot throughout the movie(probably due to impatience) and some people whispering all while watching the movie. The theatre is so quiet so is the movie. The movie felt like reading a book during peak summer in a middle of a dessert under the shades of palm tree while having a cold drink.
It's not a regular movie and it is definitely not one of your popcorn movies .  

Did I love the movie? Maybe

That's so heartbreaking to have the only thing your family has built for themselves and have it taken by someone else and claimed it as their own.|, I really admired Kroc's persistence, but my heart was shattering in pieces. I found this movie pretty sad, having more sympathy for the two brothers than mr. Kroc.|, I'm loving the resurgence of Michael Keaton as a A list movie actor. The dude is an amazing actor and good human being.|, Just finished watching the movie I’ve to say this it’s really sad and heartbreaking. I find it surprising how can someone ever live with the guilt of backstabbing a person (the brothers) so bad. Sorry not sorry 

P.S - moral of the story trust nobody.|, Genuinely looking forward to seeing this. It's got a great cast, and really a story that should be told. Can't wait for its release next month.|, Here I was expecting a happy ending for the McDonald Brothers, then I remembered it was based on a true story.|, After watching this movie, you'll never see McDonald's the same way ever again.|, Glad to see Michael Keaton headlining big movies again. I think he has a shot at winning an Oscar for this movie. Must-see!|, Loved this movie. Showed people the cut-throat, cold-blooded mentality to become a successful businessman.|, In the beginning it felt like it was a guy that wanted to change it...but then you realize you were cheering for the villain."

Yeah this is a Wes Anderson film.|, Finally a trailer that leaves me still wondering what the film is actually about. It makes you want to see more without giving away every detail about what’s going to happen.|, I swear Wes Anderson can make everyone beautiful. This movie is great, I got distracted throughout how stylistically beautiful it was. Every single shot is composed magnificently. All the people are at least visually memorable. A masterpiece.|, Wes Anderson, hate him or love him, is one stylish director. His films are so pretty and well made. He provides a level of detail in every frame that is astounding. He is a true auteur.|, The thing I love so much about Wes Anderson’s films is that by the end, I feel happy that there’s been a happy ending, but sad that this vision of a idiosyncratic, picturesque world is over forever and contained to the sole story presented. A master of his own style.|, The most Wes Anderson of all the Wes Anderson movies ever made.|, Adrien Brody is once again fighting for a painting in a Wes Anderson movie.|, Another brilliant piece of film by an incredible team. Wes is  without a doubt amongst the elite of film makers, and the way he casts is on another level. There is nothing that falls short in this film. It's funny, sad, dramatic, inspiring all while being visually pleasing and soulfully satisfying. Do Not Miss Out.|, Nossa quanta saudade dos filmes de Wes Anderson !

There's a massive plot twist at the end as well! The way it fits in it's really good.|, I honestly don't know why people think it looks horrible. It looks like a good movie 😍|, One of the best horror movies of the last 10 years. I loved it.|, I personally am going to see this movie when it comes out.  If they do a sequel, I hope they explore the origin of Charlie and why he remains at the school after all these years.  I believe Charlie was a theatre kid who dreamed about becoming a movie star someday and immortalizing himself on the big screen.  Bullied and made fun of by the popular kids of the school, Charlie gets even by ratting them out to the principle (they had marijuana on them and they could get expelled from school).  As the school prepares their local production of The Gallows, the cool kids learn that Charlie is going to play the lead role in the play.  Wanting revenge on Charlie for ratting them out, they device a plan to embarrass Charlie in front of the whole school, they switch rope for the hanging scene with a cheaper rope.  For once they ""hang"" Charlie, it snaps and causes Charlie to fall right on his face.  As they prepare to do the deed, they accidently use the wrong rope and use a stronger brand of rope for the hanging.  As they watch from the back, they are unaware of what's going to happen next.  Charlie is hung from the Gallows but the rest of the cast sees that this is not apart of the show, and soon realizes he is dead.  Afraid of getting into trouble and ruining their futures, they say nothing and swore to secrecy.  This could lead to the storyline of the sequel, where they return to the high school for a reunion.  Now rich and successful they are completely unaware that Charlie hasn't forgotten about what they did to him, he has waited for over twenty years for his revenge.  They ended his life, now it's time to end theirs.|, This was filmed locally. I was there at the theater premiere night. The directors (who also go to my church and I see every week and I’m really good friends with) and Jason Blum were there. It was awesome!|, This movie was actually made as a tribute to the co-director's friend, Charlie, who died on the set of a high school play at Beatrice High School in Beatrice Nebraska in 1993. The movie was not inspired by the Charlie Charlie challenge. |, Unpopular opinion: 

I LOVED this movie. Sure, they theatre was virtually empty when I saw it but I have no idea why. The plot was GREAT, and it had a lot of scares (I was huddled up with my older sister watching it) and while I'm not particularly fond of the 'found footage' concept, I think that this one is an exception. Well done 👏🏼|, I personally think this has potential. Charlie seems like a good horror villain. Probably not as good as Jason or Freddy, but acceptable. As long as they don't just focus on crappy jumpscares, this should be good...hopefully...|, I just saw it and it is definitely worth watching. Quality horror movie."

The cast, story, script with music, and the marriage of wardrobe and set is one of the best movies in ages! Guy & Matthew knocked it out of the park! 💯⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|, Charlie Hunnam is a remarkable actor. That scene in Sons of Anarchy where Jax finds Tara's body was absolutely gut wrenching and quite frankly an Oscar worthy performance|, This was a great scene because we all knew and were told Ray is the best but all we've seen of Ray is that he's always cool and calm, but this scene was the first time we saw Ray actually be a gangster/badass|, This movie is so good. And I love how he gives them every opportunity to walk away in peace (even though he absolutely has the upper hand) and then finally he's like ""aight screw this sh*t"" and pulls outs the MP5. Damn good scene, fantastic movie."

I know this is THE song for us just like we know we’re THE ones for each other. Can’t wait to dance to this song with him! 😍😍|, Beautiful song. This song is our song. We two are blessed to have each other as God's gifts. Thank you for sharing this beautiful song.|, This was the song my cousin sang at our wedding 23 years ago. My future DIL asked what our wedding song was. She is marrying my son in 2 1/2 weeks! 💕|, Me and my ex girlfriend always sings this song and it is like our theme song. Hoping the best to you! I'd be extremely happy if you came back tho. You are the only one who understands my pain and make efforts to make me calm whenever I am having a panic attack. Thank you!|, Can’t wait to sing this on my wedding day ❤❤ I’ll come back hoping it will come true|, Very nice lyrics ...i love this song🥰"
The Girl in the Book,"The Girl in the Book Official Trailer 1 (2015) - Emily VanCamp, Michael Nyqvist Drama HD",b_CM0FIcoKc,6190975,20791,397,"Emily VanCamp is a very, very, very good actress. With potential to become a major player in Hollywood if the right film hits. I've always been impressed with her performances, even in low budget TV movies. I'd like to see her do a really, y'know, demented person or something. Something away from her normal, sweet schtick. A part that shows her in a much different light and makes people notice. She just has to be snapped up by a great director.|, Michael Nyqvist is such a good actor and Emily VanCamp is also , so I'm looking forward to seeing this movie when it comes out on Dec. 11th.  It's been a long time coming and it's finally reality.  Hope it's as good as it looks!|, This movie is so heart wrenching in dealing with the sexual abuse and realizing it so many years ago, and no one cares now so sad and depressing but a great movie not boring kept me interested the whole time|, Emily Vancamp is a great actress. Really underrated. The right film could get her all the recognition.|, Emily Vankamp is one of the best actresses I’ve seen in years.  She was phenomenal in REVENGE.  I cannot understand why she is not more popular.|, the use of lines from 'A boat beneath the sunny skies' at the end of the trailer is genius because Lewis Caroll (the author of that poem and Alice and wonderland) is thought to have had a similar relationship with Alice Liddell whom he based the character of Alice on . The two stories are very related so the use of a refrence here was amazing .|, Saw this and it was brilliant. I felt for her so much.|, Waiting for this movie since forever! So glad to see Emily again!|, This trailer just moved me in an uncomfortable but honest way!!!"
The Girl in the Spider's Web,THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER&#39;S WEB - Official Trailer (HD),XKMSP9OKspQ,8002069,43225,3815,"I'm so sorry...
Rooney Mara deserved to do two more sequels as Lisbeth.
She was phenomenal|, I really love Claire Foy as an actress she's great, but Rooney Mara absolutely floored me with her portrayal as Lisbeth Salander in the girl with the Dragon tattoo back in 2011 would have been great if she came back because i just can't imagine anyone else playing the role now lol......|, Claire Foy is an AMAZING actress! I'm not big on action films, but if she's in it, I'm watching.|, I like how Lisbeth makes her self the absolutely most recognizable person with her crazy tats, punk style + way of dressing yet tries to be an stealth character who needs to lay low and not draw attention. Real spies look as ordinary as possible to combat suspicion and reduce attention, Lisbeth can't walk outside without people looking at her.|, When I made my list for most anticipated movies of 2018, this movie was number 1. And after seeing this trailer, I can say that I'm extremely excited to see this movie. Fede Alvarez is clearly not trying to imitate Fincher's style, he's trying to go for the same vibe and tone he had with his previous movies, and I like it for that reason. I'm bummed that Rooney Mara is not returning to her Oscar nominated role of Lisbeth Salander, but I can live with it. Words can't describe how excited I am for this.|, I have to say Claire Foy was phenomenal in this movie and I really enjoyed it|, Looks really good. Never imagines Claire Foy as an action star but she does it well.|, Lisbeth was a charactor that spoke to me. Seeing her butchered like this, it actually hurts and makes me want to cry to see Hollywood kill her.|, Finally! My most anticipated film of the year! And as much as I love Rooney, I have faith in Claire :)|, Sooo... Coming from someone who has not seen any of the other movies or read the book. I just saw it as a pre-weekend 'girls night opening' at Disney.
I loved it! We were in the edge of our seats the whole time❤"
The Girl on the Train,"The Girl on the Train Official Teaser Trailer #1 (2016) - Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett Movie HD",KkoEE1i0CX8,11195396,39800,3503,"I just finished reading the book. At the beginning I thought it was quiet boring but when the exciting part came up I couldn't put the book down. I loved it. It was so hypnotizing. I felt my heart racing and my adrenaline going while I was reading. I really enjoyed it and I do have good hopes for the movie too
Totally recommend this one|, I loved this movie. I usually cannot sit long in movies without getting bored. I was kept on my feet the whole time, and there were no boring scenes at all. Really good thriller and mystery.|, One of the best movies I've ever seen !
Emily's acting in this movie was just unbelievable 
Really talented young actress ❤️|, This movie is just epic , the way Emily Blunt acted was simply amazing , I think she really do deserve an Oscar for this role !|, I like how Paula Hawkins wrote this book. It was descriptive enough for us readers to clearly visualize her words in every chapter.|, Never ever saw Blunt portraying such a sad, depressed, liquor smashing, estranged, awkward person, she nailed it, I think the fact she was pregnant during filming also contributed to her performance because during pregnancy women tend to be more emotionally vulnerable than ever, she took those redundant feelings and express them into acting. 
 An average person can distract his bad feelings by doing his every day mediocre job, suppressing those feelings by doing something else, but no matter what the average person does those bad feelings will come back to him because he does not express them, he only suppress them. While an actor can take this bag of needless, redundant thoughts and add them to the character he or she choose to portray and actually express them on set, there's nothing more relieving than this method.|, You know when you're so excited about a movie that you actually can't wait to pay for it and watch it at the cinema? Well, this is how I feel about this! It looks SOOOOOO good (and I almost never feel like this about most movies)|, definately a really good movie! It won't let you down, every bit of it makes sence, very realistic,  very well written and very well played. I did not expect it to be that good!|, I read the novel and it's totally good! You'll see how the perspectives of the three women will change, bombard, and shock you. I hope the film will not lose its prowess of being an enigmatic one.|, Seen it in the cinema last night! an amazing movie in which you get attached to the characters just like in the book. will definitely be watching this again!"
The Giver,"The Giver Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Jeff Bridges, Taylor Swift Movie HD",fH6B4S9ENY4,1210187,5985,1094,"This movie is insanely good. It is not the exact same as the book, but in a way the movie had to be different in order to help you see and feels things from a screen instead of a page.|, ""The Giver"" Is a man who gives memories of how human life used to take place. The memories are passed down in order to keep them alive while the rest of humanity lives in small communities with everything regulated and controlled to ensure fairness and happiness. Nobody can see color, nor feel strong emotions. Jobs are given based on performance in distinct areas of school, Birth is given by selected individuals and death is not known to anyone. Old people and sick people are ""sent off"" nobody knows they are being killed.

Now this movie probably makes it look like the Giver isnt supposed to be giving his memories to the boy, but thats exactly what the community wants. The only opposition is when the boy makes a decision to leave the community. He makes that choice after learning about death (from what I remember, correct me if Im wrong)

This movie will probably add a whole bunch of action and explosions when in reality its a quiet book for the most part.|, Oh my god, this looks amazing! I'm so excited, especially since we finally have movie that doesn't include too many well-known actors/actoresses (not saying that's a bad thing cause Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep are brilliant) but there needs to be fresh blood I think! Can't wait!|, One of my favorite childhood novels has been adapted into film.
Not too sure how I feel about the trailer at first watch, but I'm still excited!|, At first I thought this was boring that I watched it anyway and then I got hooked on it and actually it had a great script and a great ending in a great meeting and I appreciated it so thanks to the Riders the actors and the director and producers great movie|, Spoilers: To the people complaining about why this isnt in black and white, we arent watching the movie through the eyes of any of the characters, so we still see color. Im sure they'll have scenes where the camera cuts to a black and white shot and you see the world through Jonas' eyes for a moment while Jonas is learning to see color|, Yes yes yes! I've always wanted one of the books to be made into movies!|, i remember this going on a field trip in 5th grade after reading the whole book popcorn method in class 😂😂😂|, A story that I actually enjoyed in 6th grade|, aren't they supposed to be TWELVE?"
The Glass Castle,The Glass Castle Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Trailers,bdNiNhSeSDk,2403901,15538,914,"To those who never picked up this memoir, you will never truly see, feel, or taste the devastation of Jeannette walls.  I understand the movie chooses to promote the best parts of the novel, but sometimes, the kick of reality is what makes any story stand out.  Especially, one that is real and profoundly said.  Jeannette's parents wanted her to have a sense of adventure, yes, but the book capitalizes on the depth and pain her parents put her through.  It is that pain, that drove her to new heights and new possibilities.  Truly, the best memoir I ever read.  I suggest you read, not just skim, but read the words she writes.  You won't be disappointed.|, This movie touched my heart because I came from a dysfunctional family. After watching the movie I’m looking forward to reading the book….
So deep, so real and painful to watch it’s a movie about parents who love their kids but it’s from the mindset of mental illness and what that looks and feels like from a child’s point of view. 
In the end the children grow up and realize through the hardship and despair the parents inflicted on them it’s about forgiveness and that life isn’t always dogtails and butterflies but taking what life gives you and learning and growing from that.|, I read the book years ago and its still one of my all time favorites. I was skeptical about how it would be portrayed on film as many as you are and with good reason. The book was dark and twisted and sometimes seemed hopeless. But also there was adventure and laughter and such a raw look into this families life that was amazing to read. In my opinion I thought the movie hit all the notes. Watching the movie felt like seeing Jeanettes family come to life. The music and the way it was filmed I feel matched what I pictured while reading the book. Yes there was a few scenes that were not included in the film but that is to be expected. But I feel that the movie truly did the The Glass Castle justice and i would recommend the movie to everyone. It had me angry and laughing and crying just like the book did and thats the goal right?|, I always found her love for her parents beyond comprehension (especially the, sorry but, god-awful, selfish mother). I hope they portray the complexity of that in this movie - of her loving her parents, needing to leave, wanting to help and feeling helpless in her intense loyalty.|, I honestly feel like this should’ve been a mini series of 8 or 10 episodes because there’s enough story telling and source material to work with|, I had the opportunity to meet Jeannette with this organization I worked with in college. She’s incredible. Although I’m not super fond of how they show this movie in this trailer as a “feel good family,” movie, it makes me think of her. She isn’t angry and she’s not running from her past. In fact, she celebrates it because it’s made her who she is. She said she was still close to her mother and her siblings. And she said she loved her dad and recognized that he loved her in the best way he knew how, even though it might not have been the best. She’s a resilient, badass woman. I got to talk with her afterwards about my relationship with my own father and how it was similar to hers and it helped me start to heal a lot of wounds. This trailer has her spirit and her energy in it.|, I remember reading The Glass Castle back in Sophomore year. Such a great novel, I'm really excited for this film. Brie Larson will do an excellent job as always.|, Hands down one of the best movies and Woody Harrelson should get an award for best Actor! Unforgettable and deeply moving film , I cried and laughed with the rawness of heart and vision this film has 😘❤|, One of my favorite movies. It's so beautiful and inspiring, I cried through all of it.|, I think this should have been made into a series instead of a movie. They left out the most gruesome parts of the book--parts of Jeannette's life. People who haven't read the book wouldn't understand the complexity of Jeannette's life just by watching this movie."
The Godfather,THE GODFATHER | Opening Scene | Paramount Movies,eZHsmb4ezEk,2544737,30730,1863,"“What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?”

I’d be breaking out in a sweat.|, 400 years later, we are still watching plays by Shakespeare.
In 400 years time, we will still be watching The Godfather.|, In this scene the cat wasn't part of script. It appeared on stage out of nowhere, Marlon Brando just continued acting with it. It really adds up to the scene.|, This was just a small taste of how Vito gained all his power. First line of question ""why didn't you just come to me first?"" nailed it - up until this point that guy avoided Vito at all costs and Vito called him out on it instantly. He commanded respect and made it clear he's not just some petty gangster|, So much to unpack in the scene:

The great opening line.
The slow transition of Bonasera being in charge to being inferior to Vito via his story and a slow reverse zoom/dolly pull.
Brando’s effortless acting.
The lighting (or lack thereof).
The characters wearing classy, sophisticated tuxes.
The cat being completely improvised.

Classic.|, ""We are not murderers inspite of what this Undertaker says"" (goes on to smell the rose on his suit). God, the nuances Brando brought to the character. Truly one of the greatest acting performances of all time. 🔥|, The Godfather is a timeless masterpiece. One of the best movies ever made. It sucks we don’t get films like this nowadays|, One of the greatest scenes of all time from the greatest film of all time. This film is a masterpiece.|, This scene doesn’t even feel like I’m watching a film, I feel like I’m literally in the room… that’s how good this film is.|, The Godfather is still undefeated. Arguably the greatest movie ever made."

More of this, please.|, Absolutely brilliant film! I really liked the ending too! I wish more people knew about this film, I love seeing older people being the main characters especially if it’s with legends such as Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen.|, Just watched it, man this is a masterpiece! 
Loved the plot ohmygoodness!!!

If you're looking for movies with same genre, and loves to get stressed out watching a movie, 
here's a list for you, you're welcome.

The Invisible Guest
The Woman in the Window
The Girl on the Train
Fractured
Gone Girl
Trial by Fire|, Just watched it for the second time, and enjoyed it more after the re watch.
Two towering performances by the leads. 
Full of twists and turns, so try not to blink.|, This is a gem of a movie mercifully free of gratuitous violence and formulalic car chases and gun battles. A plot twisting and turning with an ending no one expected. 5 stars from me.|, WOW this looks fantastic! Acting royalty here, plus suspense,what more could you want in a movie experience.|, Two great actors undeniably smashing the ageist ceiling in film, but I cant shake the feeling that one is a decade older than the other, even if the reality is that its only a six-year difference. I look forward to the film.|, This looks good, what a refreshing change! For once it's not about an actor \ actress getting their kit off but about actual acting! 😁|, This movie has everything a movie needs. Brilliant actors, a fascinating, surprising plot and a professional crew to make it happen. THANKS for the upload, it has been a real pleasure to watch."
The Good Lie,"The Good Lie Official Trailer (2014) - Reese Witherspoon, Lost Boys of Sudan Drama Movie HD",c2tI5zW3IU8,1939408,5527,439,"A great movie. One we could all learn from.  The hardships those children endured and the sacrifices they made to reach America showed us what some will go through for a better life. A life some of us take for granted.  Wonderful movie.|, I just watched this movie.  What touched me the most?  The HONOR these young men and their sister had amongst them.  I did not see this movie as ""going to America is a great thing"" -  I saw the dignity, the truthfulness and yes, the honor of these young people.  We should all learn a lesson from them.|, This movie makes me appreciate the things we take for granted in America. Loved this movie!!|, I cried a couple of times during the movie but the ending really got to me 😪|, Absolutely beautiful movie. We must learn to be thankful for what we have. So many have suffered without food, homes, etc. Develope a loving heart towards others!|, What a great movie, get the tissue box, even today when I think about the sacrifices of the children and young adults in this true story, it still chokes me up|, LOVED ""The Good Lie""! I went to a screening the other night and listened to Kuoth Wiel (she plays the sister of the Sudanese refugees in the film) talk about her personal story and about the making of this film. It opened my eyes to something I did not know a whole lot about. Every one should see this and learn what they can do to help out.|, Gotta be honest: The story is seen before,  and I guess it will do great as a Feel good movie for some, BUT that song in this trailer is what maid it for me. It's just so hauntingly beautiful! I Hope the song is a part of the movie! This song should be nominated for an Academy award !|, I watched the movie ""The Good Lie"" and it was actually an amazing film. The film wasn't necessarily based on a white savior. It was based on the lost boys story. The film doesn't make them seem weak or dum. Although, the trailor might give the lost boys the aspect of weakness, the actually film shows the struggle and the bravery that they had to face. The film also shows the general aspect of Americans. It shows the American's selfish character and how we take for granted the privileges that are freely given to us.  Everyone is blowing this up into proportions. Both films ""The Blind Side"" and ""The Good Lie"" does not give the impression of a white savior. The film does not give that impression  at all. It seems as if the stories behind both films are being thrown away and not given a second glance.  You might look at the stories and see a white woman saving a black man once again. I look between the lines... between the crevices of the story. Do you know what I find there? I find that there is much more to the story itself. Both stories are about perseverance, pure faith, hope, love and honest redemption. I heed you to look deeper than the story itself or you will miss something great.|, THIS MOVIE THATILL NEVERBE FORGOTTEN ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭"

It's a bit of a slow burn but check it out|, 😂 i didnt watch the movie. but i feel the brother did it.|, It's great to see Swank back on the screen with a decent looking project.|, So sad they cancelled Alaska Daily. She was great in it, as were the rest of that diverse cast. Terrific storyline. Unique insight into day-to-day regional journalism.The only hard-hitting drama to dig into the under-reported and under-investigated violence against indigenous populations.

Wes Anderson is a genius!|, I think its a testament to Anderson's film making that this trailer reveals almost every major plot point, and it really does not take away from your enjoyment.|, I saw this today and it was the best, quirkiest, funniest and most wonderful film I've seen in a long time. Raefe Fiennes was perfect in that role. Classic comedy and such a lush, gorgeous visual pleasure to watch. So many wonderful other actors made it a complete pleasure. So nice to see villains in Black with big curly moustaches again. |, I don't think enough people understand how truly beautiful this film is. It can completely change your life, if you let it.|, Notice how none of the shots are at all turned or tilted. Every one of them is at a square 90°. That's a dedicated cinematographer right there.|, This movie was nothing short of magnificent. The storyline, characters, setting, and cinematography are all unlike anything I’ve ever seen in film. The blend of genres (comedy, romance, and drama) sucked me right in. The way in which themes were explored was just so compelling and profound. I simply can’t say enough about this movie. Definitely one of Wes Anderson’s greatest works|, This movie is a visual treat. I just love how the shots are always unapologetically well-composed. This movie is self-consicous and not afraid to be beautiful.|, Watching trailers all day and avoiding homework."

I dont get why people hate on this film. The story never gets to the point of becoming ""draggy"" and peppered with the right amount of action. Even the drama scenes are captivating. I certain love the slow-mo environmental shots and slow-motion fights; it reminds me a lot of the RDJr. Sherlock Holmes fight scenes. Also the costumes remind me of noir based anime's. I liked the Donnie Yen interpretations of Yip Man because they were lighthearted and i like this one because it is so stylish. Neither should be considered better than the other in my opinion. I hope more people get to appreciate this film. :)|, If you are at all into martial arts or the Chinese Japanese lifestyle or history you can love and respect this very great sad story. I didn't think they could replace Donnie as they did but wow was I blow away by the master. When you watch a movie especially one as great as this one look at the beauty of the culture the humbleness and GRACE of some characters it is truly art unwanding itself before your very eyes its sad that you don't see it. I,m glad I do.|, Zhang Zi yi is one marvelous lady. Her acting skills superb and not easily forgotten. 10 years producing this movie is no joke. Respect in every aspect. Tony Leung is legend as always.|, Not a fan of martial arts films but I loved this movie. The acting was great, the fight scenes were astounding and well choreographed and the story of the man who inspired Bruce Lee was a good one. Tony Leung learned Kung Fu from scratch but watching the finished product will impress even the most fervent fans.|, The trailer doesn’t do it justice. This movie is so beautifully shot - it changed my brain chemistry. The director is so insanely talented he can even make a simple shot of a mundane bench look like a cinematic masterpiece. And to the ones disliking this movie - only thing i will say is that beauty lies in the eye of the beholder 😇|, This movie was absolutely amazing. I was engaged the whole time and the ending had me crying. |, I've never seen an action movie with so much artistic merit. Absolutely stunning cinematography!|, I saw the movie this afternoon and it is life changing -- it is only partially about martial arts, mostly it is about life, and art, and beauty, and loyalty and love. You HAVE to watch this movie even if it is the last thing you'll ever do. Go see it now in a theater near you. Rating: 6 out of 1 to 5 stars.|, I just finished watching this and there's only one way to describe this film and that is beautiful|, this is not an action movie, it is a film of wong-kar wai... so amazing"

He died thinking that his book was a flop.|, i love how the trailer doesnt spoil a single bit of the movie. and it turned out to be one of the best movies ive seen.  im still confused how leo didnt get an oscar for this play.|, I genuinely love this film, it introduced me to the book when I was in fifth grade when it first came out and I haven’t gone a year without rereading the book or rewatching the movie since—the book is superior, but this film will always hold a special place in my heart, right next to its source material.|, I have a huge place in my heart for this film, I saw it in the cinema with my parents upon release. I was 18 and absolutely captivated by the presentation and soundtrack/score.

I remember being thrown into this world and then gut struck by the ending and the huge lesson the story teaches the audience.

That lesson being is that a dream can lead you to your grave and love can blind you from the truth.|, aside from the story..
this film had gorgeous cinematography  
it's a visual masterpiece|, I just can't get over with this trailer, I've been watching it every year since its release. ""Love is Blindness"" fits perfectly and the editing is beyond amazing. I love this film, even though it got too much hate. I wish people could see it's worth.|, Leo looks just as he did when he was young during Titanic. Just a little weight gain and facial hair. He doesn't age and is such a wonderful actor. |, One of the best movies I've ever seen! Seriously, it's just so beautiful even though I didn't like the end!|, Everyone is talking about how Daisy and Tom screwed over Gatsby. Gatsby was not screwed over by anyone. He was blinded by love and forgot that Daisy was a married women with a child. If he opened his eyes a little bit, he would have seen that Daisy still loves Tom. But the reality of it is that everyone in this story screwed over Nick Carraway. He was just a pawn they used as it pleased them. No one cared about him or his opinions. Gatsby befriended him to get closer to Daisy; Daisy was close to him because he knew Gatsby; Tom befriended him so he can have someone he can go out and party with and show his superiority. Nick was the true gentleman that put others before himself. He was the only man that worried about others even after their death.

The Green Inferno,The Green Inferno Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Eli Roth Horror Movie HD,FcpYPu9M3bw,15557760,47091,4756,"What I liked about this film is it plays on our subconscious fears. There is no chainsaw welding maniac, no poltergeist possessed doll, it’s all psychological. You’re forced to imagine yourself in a situation like that and it stimulates anxiety and tension.  Just don’t eat anything before or while watching.|, The person who fell out of the plane had the privilege of experiencing a quicker death.|, Just watched the movie. There wasn't a part I was bored. What an experience|, ""No good deed goes unpunished"" Thats my favorite quote of all time! Such wise words have never been spoken before!|, I love Eli Roth. Once in a while there are these filmmakers that come along that just make great horror films. They usually have great taste in horror films themselves. I wonder if he does another cameo in this one.|, I just watched this movie for the 1st time over the weekend, oh my goodness, I got so many chills, the hair all over my body stood up for the entire movie or at least after the plane crash, Good Stuff, hope they are still going to make the sequel.|, the people who died from the plane crash were the luckiest|, I just finished watching this movie about an hour ago and I enjoyed every minute of it. By the time it was over my stomach was rumbling. It made me work up one hell of an apatite. So I grabbed some Taco Bell and had myself a Mexican pizza. Whew! Anyway, Green Inferno is one of the best modern horror movies to date, and can easily rank up there with the classic 70's and 80's horror movies. I read that Eli Roth made this movie in tribute to some Italian cannibal horror movies of those decades, and he certainly fulfilled! I'm not much of a fan of his other stuff, but I'm glad to see that his movies have improved over the years instead of getting worse like most other horror directors today.

Green Inferno actually had a point. (A rarity in horror today). It had characters that I got to care about, a good twist, no cheesy death scenes, excellent acting, dialog and directing. It even had some ""parts"" that you can laugh at despite watching a group of people facing being eaten. 
 
I'd like to see Eli Roth continue along this path and leave the torture for the sake of torture behind. I understand that some of his other stuff is beyond extreme. This guy has too much talent to waste on that crap. He needs to help the genre become much more than what it has turned into during these past two decades!|, After these 5 whole years, this movie still stuck in my head. Thanks eli roth 👍👍👍|, Something that calms me down- Imagine the cannibals at the buffet on set eating grapes"

It became my favorite story of those legends. Insanely hyped to see it brought to screen in a way similar to how I imagined it would be|, Saw this two nights ago. Absolutely incredible. I will say that it's not for everyone - I saw many people leaving the theater unhappy who I imagine expected something more conventional. But if you think it is for you, you have gotta see it. Beautiful, mesmerizing, and introspective. This is also a movie that benefits from the theater experience (I would compare it in this respect to something like Blade Runner 2049), so if you feel safe with all the virus stuff, try to catch it on the big screen. I am going to see it again tomorrow.|, Instant classic, 10/10. I found no flaws with my first viewing. Director and everyone went above and beyond. Cinematography, acting, color palate, costume design, writing, simply everything.|, Saw this in theaters earlier this evening. Absolutely phenomenal film, definitely my favorite film of the year so far. Gorgeous cinematography, a great performance from Dev Patel, and also very trippy and surreal.|, This was seriously amazing. such an atmospheric movie! The visuals are simply incredible and Dev Patel Killed it!|, A24 needs to give the video editors who make their trailers a raise.|, I can't believe Gawain is finally getting a glimpse of the spotlight he deserves, Lancelot is so overplayed when we have the greatest knight right here.|, This actually looks like art, this looks like true film. I feel like that’s lacking in today’s era. Huge medieval/fantasy fan, love Excalibur, cannot wait for this!!! And it’s an A24 film.

The amount of detail in this entire song let alone these lyrics alone is like she ripped it straight out of her diary. the raw emotion and pain you hear in her voice is heartbreaking. Wow Olivia|, This entire album is actually so good I don’t understand how people can’t like it|, I watched my 15 year old daughter lose her three best friends. They just kind of decided they didn’t want her anymore. It cut deeper than any boyfriend break up. Three years later, her feelings have been put into words.   “Grudge”, for her, it’s not about a boy, it’s about those friends that decided one day that she wasn’t enough.|, This song is extremely healing for my inner teenage girl.

and i fantasise about a time you’re a little fucking sorry”

Best song on the album, absolutely beautiful|, Use this as the Olivia Rodrigo is a musical genius button!!!|, Minha música favorita em todo mundoo|, This song reminds my daughter about her mother and how she was treateated and gas lighted by her.

Dan Stevens' on-screen presence is totally magnetic. This would have been an absolute cult classic if it were released 30 years ago.|, I loved it. Loved the dark tone of it and the soundtrack is absolutely genius- just adds to that cynical feeling. I hope they make a sequel. I expected a cheap action movie but what I got is a deeply cynical mysterious thriller. Awesome!|, I loved the scene where he sees the heavy machine gun pointed at him and just rolls his eyes. It's subtle things like that that make the movie! I also liked the sudden change in tone halfway through the movie from a seemingly normal film to twisted thriller. Soundtrack was also amazing and the scene inside the maze and mirror room with music made it great! |, This film is soooo good!
Dan is  dangerous charming!
The atmosphere of the film, Dan's character, energy, even soundtracks- everything was absolutely on a high level. Waiting for a sequel!
Dan would be great Bond, by the way|, Just seen this and it was amazing. Honestly the best film I have seen in ages surprisingly. Decided to watch this because I was bored and definitely didn't expect it to be so good! Had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through and the ending didn't disappoint at all, hoping there will be a sequel. |, Loved this movie so much, and Dan stevens kills it, I know its not a drama, but he should've been nominated for an oscar, I'm serious, the guy had so much charisma, it was impossible to take your eyes off him|, Watched this today without knowing anything about it and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The storyline is unique as is the delivery of the film. And the soundtrack is pretty sick too and goes brilliantly well with the film. |, He is programmed to be alive and protect himself. He is stronger than death and he has a mission to do his assignments and to live. Excellent thriller from Adam Wingard from 2014. Main actor is a young protagonist Dan Stivens (1982). Ones who like thrillers,  have to watch this amazing thriller movie.|, this movie is a gem. it's amazing that action cinema still has something to say in the new reality, where it would seem - we've already seen everything|, His facial expressions are everything. especially in that seen were they are shooting down the whole house and the other scene were he threw the grenade.

The movie has a great story and is relevant. Ignore the poor ratings that you might read and go ejoy this movie.|, I like that Sean Penn makes more action movies.

The director - Park Chan-Wook, is truly a master in his craft. The set design, costume design, and writing were fabulous. I also loved the acting performances, my favorites being Kim Min-hee (as Hideko) and Ha Jung-woo (as Count Fujiwara). Korean Cinema never fails to amaze me. I really want to suggest this movie to my friends but most of them are not comfortable reading subtitles while watching and the $ex scenes might be too much for them.|, Man does Park Chan-Wook know how to shoot a movie, every shot in the movie is just beautiful|, I can't explain what this movie makes you feel.

But I unfortunately did not have a driver's license and had nobody else to take me to see the movie. So my grandma took me to see The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. She went in not knowing anything about Tolkien or Middle-earth, and she did not like watching movies that were scary or violent. She figured she would sit in her seat and eat popcorn the entire time while I watched the movie. But as we watched the movie, she became completely enthralled in it. She loved the scene when the dwarves started arriving at Bag End, and was on the edge of her seat whenever the characters were in danger, and genuinely wanted to see them survive. It was a great experience for both of us.

After that, I waited patiently for three years until all three Hobbit movies were released and watched before showing her The Lord of the Rings. She ended up loving all six movies. Not only that, but it opened up the chance for me to watch all kinds of other movies and TV shows with her that she normally wouldn't ever consider watching, and she ended up enjoying a good number of them.|, I used to be disappointed in the trilogy but, after giving myself some time, I actually loved this movie!! I loved how deep they went into the story and how detailed it is! For exemple, the dinner scene is much more exciting and funny than I imagined compared to the book. The Eagles scene is mesmerizing!! Like it or not, you have to thank Peter Jackson for bringing us back to Middle Earth on screen after nearly a decade. The Hobbit trilogy may not be as oscar worthy as the Lord of the Rings, but it is certainly fun to watch when you let go of expectations.|, People hate way to much on these movies. I will never forget this trilogy|, Regardless of your opinion of these movies, they offered what will likely be the very last chance for any of us to go to Middle Earth again. And for that, I'm thankful.|, I happen to adore this movie. Anyone in disagreement can enjoy Twilight for all I care.|, Idc what anyone says I've been marathoned the LOTR movies every year for over 10 years. and now that I own these on blu ray as well I watch all 6 movies and I absolutely love every second of it. these movies are just amazing.|, might not be as good as the lord of the rings but im greatful the hobbit movies exist. they add extra depth to the whole story|, Certainly not as good as LOTR trilogy, but still a more than worthy prequel trilogy.|, Man, this was such a big part of my life when I was younger, I even got obsessed with the game for 2 years, still occasionally get on it.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,The Hobbit (2013) - Battle of the five Armies - Part 1 - Only Action [4K] (Directors Cut),_kvjKaTqX4c,118031021,701672,12951,"3:25 To this day, I just...I can't even. WHAT?

Elves, the WHOLE idea of that formation is to take the brunt of the charge. Pinning the enemy in place, allowing an easily outflank. Phalanx formations have been doing it since antiquity. It's like that for the same reason shields are broad and heavy armor is thick - to take the hit. By jumping over it, you merely demonstrate incompetence. And probably get some of your own number skewered on Dwarven spears in the places where it becomes a crush.

I can't help but imagine the Dwarven officer's grunt of frustration at 3:42, because they now have to break their own phalanx in order to charge forwards and join the melee...with spears. Probably losing more soldiers, trying to save the Elves from themselves and their inexperience.

**Edit** - Imagine you're watching a gritty war film on the Second Battle of Fallujah. And during the climax of the film, the music swells, and the soldiers charge out of their positions to run across an open courtyard to start clubbing the enemy with their rifles. And rather than simply shoot them, the enemy do the same, getting up and having a melee, for seemingly no reason. Then the tank crews do it. Followed by the helicopter pilots, who land their vehicles, dismount, and get stuck in with fisticuffs.

It's not played for comedy. The Hans Zimmer music is blasting. And the director is filming this completely straight. Expecting it to look epic.

But all it does is shine a spotlight on the directors lack of understanding. Lack of even preliminary research. And it makes the characters (particularly the losing characters) look like fools. THAT is the Battle of the Five Armies.|, I love how the elves are perfect at everything, but they still can’t compare to the dwarves ingenuity and teamwork|, Anyone else think the dwarves setting up their shield wall looks awesome? Just how quickly and efficiently they do it too.|, I love how shocked the elves get when suffering losses. The notion of death is so unnatural to them, they know every loss could have been avoided.|, I love how quickly the elves and dwarves teamed up against the orcs despite just now starting a battle|, I like this battle a lot because it shows the dwarves and elves, both studying and preparing for each other´s tactics but also understimating each other. First the elves, thinking that dwarves are only used to close combat battles in the mines, try to overwhelm them with arrows, but the dwarves were prepared and counter them with ballistas that were clearly designed just for that. But then the dwarves charge at the elves with goats, thinking they are only used to fighting at the distance in the woods behind the trees, only to be surprised by the elves´ incredibly organized spear formation, which traps and slaughters the riders.|, 3:24 여기 부분이 멋집니다. 피터잭슨 감독이  엘프 군대 병사들을 모두 고등학생들만 배우로 썼다고 했어요. 긴 금발에 매우 아름답고 전술이 좋은 엘프병사들 모습이 감동적입니다.|, I love how each race has their own attributes that make them great. 

Elves are wise, and elegant; but the dwarves are brave and mighty.|, This has got to be the most satisfying and frustrating battle sequence throughout Jackson's adaptations, from a tactical and C2 perspective. The ""twirlie-whirlie"" countertactic employed by the dwarves was ingenious (artillery whose only doctrinal shortfall would be its niche operational utility), and then - although captured in only a few seconds - the column formations dynamically taken by the elves to ""herd"" the dwarven cavalry charge into a spear enclosure has me thinking of the Battle of Zama, 202 BC. The way the elves immediately begin to interoperate with the dwarves by forming up into small sections, opening up lanes for the dwarves to maneuver through. The orc's use of the banner to issue battlefield commands is likewise very cool.

BUT THEN THE ELVES PARKOUR OVER THE DAMN PHALANX!! WHY?! Sure- break up the orcs' charge, but that phalanx was perfectly set up for them to hold the orcs in place, while you did LITERALLY ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO! Reposition archers, or the dwarves their twirlie-whirlies, up onto the embankments and provide fire support; maneuver your swords to the wings of the dwarves' centre, so as to secure their flanks; maneuver troops around to the orcs' rear to neutralise the nydus worms (Starcraft 2 reference), cutting off the flow of troops- LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE WOULD PRODUCE A MORE COST EFFECTIVE BATTLEFIELD EFFECT!|, Giving props to the people behind this and have subsequently given us this masterpiece. The production, the scoring, and just the overall layout is more than enough to immerse you in their world."
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],fnaojlfdUbs,14912020,66627,14250,"One of the greatest trailers ever made. The music, the characters, the nostalgia, the fore shadowing, the timing. Just... perfect|, god i miss the hype..|, Its been 7 years...and i'm still getting goosebumps|, 10 years later I came back to rewatch this masterpiece|, Despite it being about 20% accurate to the book, I loved it. I enjoyed the parts Peter Jackson added in himself and loved how it followed the same events of the book, but altered them to make it fresh and new. 
If the film had been done completely accurately to the book then instead of the exciting and amazing barrel scene it would have just been a short scene of the Dwarves locked into barrels going down a river. Also Legolas and Tauriel actually fit in really well considering neither of them were in the book (even though Legolas would have been there as Tolkien stated)
Basically the majority of (shitty) critic reviews seemed just like rants on how it isn't accurate to the book and how it isn't as dark as TLOTR, despite scenes such as where Legolas hammered an Orcs head into a beam slowly chipping bits of his skull away.
All in all I loved the book and I loved the film, mainly because I didn't go into the film looking for flaws like so many others have done.﻿|, fuck what people say about the hobbit movies. its unfair to say that these films are rubbish after comparing them to lord of the rings. in my opinion this film was incredible and will always be dear to me.|, How the fuck can you hate this movie? Movie of the year without a doubt. Peter Jackson is an absolute genius. He has made me feel like I'm watching an old classic move like Gladiator,Braveheart etc. Other movies nowadays are the bullcrap everytime all robots blah blah same boring shit but this,this was amazing.|, This movie was, without question, the best entry in the Hobbit trilogy.  Absolutely loved the Smaug character.|, Other than the love story this movie was perfect. I love Gandalf's line: It's undoubtedly a trap."" Really describes a large part of the movie, because it is much different than the first.|, One does not simply end a movie like this."
The Homesman,"The Homesman Official US Release Trailer (2014) - Tommy Lee Jones, Hilary Swank Western HD",u6uQkoXKGxM,536417,2007,212,"Stunning in all aspects !  A movie that takes your breath away. Realistic to the core. No hollywood fluff, no siree Bob.|, Love westerns and I would place this movie as one of the most realistic westerns ever made its seriously harsh to watch and depicts how tough life was in the west....Its a masterpiece.|, This movie is both haunting and amazing. Its rare to see beautiful films like this. It really captured the madness of the frontier...|, Wow--how did I miss seeing this one.  One of the best westerns I've ever seen...and should have won an academy award. 
 Ranks right up their with  Lonesome Dove and True Grit (the original one).   Well done to TLJ and Hilary Swank especially.|, Great movie...Tommy Lee Jones has fought against aliens, fugitives, cowboys, even batman, but escorting 3 crazy women for 5 weeks is a lot more than he bargained for.|, Excellent movie. The acting was great, and the film was just very well done. Don't go into it expecting an action movie though; takes a bit more of a realistic approach to the West.|, Top notch in all respects!  Superb acting, excellent story line and great cinematography!|, This  movie looks amazing! How did I miss this movie back in 2014.?|, Just finished this movie. 
Thoughts : Unlike other western movies where the hero comes out on top after a conflict between good and evil, this movie take a grasp on the reality of how overwhelming life was back then for settlers.|, 10/10
Tommy Lee pulled out the real man to show this character. He is what a real man is. A lot of us men have this in us. Thanks Tommy Lee, you put him onscreen.
Loved this film.
TLJ ?..... Truth and love, in action."
The Host,The Host Official Trailer #2 (2013) - Saoirse Ronan Movie HD,SRKjf8b4f2E,6491239,27783,6608,"How can people say it's a terrible movie? It's one of my favorites now. I just watched it and it blowed my mind. It is really beautiful and so good for sure. Don't let others fool you by saying it's a terrible movie - it was more than beautiful.|, This is an amazing movie and the message behind it is absolutely beautiful. I love how the ""antagonists"" are presented, their reasoning is understandable and almost justifiable if not for our moral and ethical values.|, I heard many bad things about the film and didn't expect much when I watched it. I was surprised of how soothing the movie was. Years later, I still think about those scenes on the field. Saoirse was wonderful in this film. She possess such pure energy of innocence that makes the film so lovely. It was how I became a fan of hers.|, My goodness this movie was so great. I haven't cried in like 8 years. If you're in the mood for a tear jerker watch this. Incredible story, cast, and visuals. Trust me this is coming from a guy who hates movies that make you cry. My personal rating for this film is a solid 9.5!!|, I just watched this film and I love it! It teaches things such as forgiveness, humanity, trust, hope and loving someone for whats in the inside! I highly reccomend this film for someone who enjoys movies with a strong meaning to it! This film is probably my favorite of all time :D|, This movie is one of my favourites and is always going to be. Its one of the few movies that actually made me cry out of sadness, happiness and at some parts frustration. I haven't read the book yet but I am definitely planning on it.!|, When I read this book I fell in love! And seeing the rating as a movie breaks me. If only they experienced what was inside the story. This book will change you, it shows you what love is even if you are different. How strong you are and even how low you can become you still come back stronger. the love you have for a loved one, and how much you believe in them! I do recommended this movie, more as a book if you are a reader. But you have to pay attention to the words. It will change your view on everything!💕💕|, Years later and it’s still one of my favorite trailers/movies|, I felt bad for how much I liked this movie and loved the book because of the critics saying it was a terrible movie. Thank you everyone who said not to listen to them I’m going to read the book and watch the movie again and fall in love with it all over again. I haven’t read it in years and it used to be my favorite|, Every movie she’s in she’s always incredibly adept at becoming the character"

Rhaenys already have armor and looked badass in the first season. It seems that they also changed out Daemon’s 3D-printed armor to a realer looking armor.|, Seeing Vhagar gave me chills. The last living of the three dragons that conquered Westeros.|, Vhagar is such a cool dragon, the holes in the wings, so much character in the little details.|, ""The grief and rage of losing a child could burn down the world. Either Aegon or Rhaenyra could live at the end, but not both.” 
 Catelyn Stark|, It's been such a long time since I accepted to be patient for a show that truly takes its time, not pumping out series after series. It's so nice to know they're not rushing production and instead taking time to craft a spectacle worthy of the franchise and the channel. Take all the time you need between series, I don't mind. Time time time time time.|, It does not matter which side you are on; this war will be heartbreaking and heart-shattering. It's all *fire and blood.*|, 00:29 Absolutely love this shot. I really do hope they manage to showcase these battles properly given how GoT had to skip showcasing a lot of its early battles because of budget limits.|, It can't be?!? Rhaenyra's outfits actually look fire?!? So hyped for this season!!!"
The House That Jack Built,"THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT Official Trailer (2018) Uma Thurman, Matt Dillon, Lars von Trier Movie HD",BYF2tfdD1fA,4793058,27759,3385,"The 3 intense first clips of the movie are available right here >> https://youtu.be/CqYBOeHQRYs

Can't wait to watch it!|, One thing I can say that I definitely appreciate about this film is that it actually paints a fearful picture of a serial killer. Many films and shows fetishize or glamorize brutality and murder. From a classic stabbing to cannibalism. Funny how so many people walked out of this film, yet I know for certain there's a seriously large amount of people who find them curious about what makes a murderer; what fuels their thrill to kill. Even so much to a point where they will read up on murder stories, secretly try to look up photos from cases, watch videos explaining details, etc. 
Yes the film is gross. Yes Von Trier is totally disturbed.
But I'm being honest here, I appreciate his love for rawness and well--honesty.|, Matt Dillon is one of the few actors who can really play both a likable good guy and a seriously menacing, terror-inducing, chillingly horror creating, bad guy.  He might just get the Oscar or a Golden Globe for this one.|, A masterpiece.
How daring the way in which the movie shows us the exciting feeling that the character has to be satisfied by committing murders, reflecting to what extent the madness of a serial killer can come. He has sincerely left me speechless and I hope another movie is made the same. 5/5 stars|, Never.. ever. Ever trust critics ratings or reviews. This movie was an a+|, Just seen it, way too soon to comment about it. But there is one thing that struck me : this could be one of the best character development I’ve seen in movies. Subtle yet perceptible, from chaotic introvert to confident killer, yet always faithful to his fundamental characteristics.|, This movie is great. From the opening scenes it illustrates character development. Early on you see this baffling fool who can barely keep it together almost to a comical point, with visceral flashbacks to his childhood, the depth at which he ascends into madness, the illustration with the lamp posts was genius, absolutely genius. Most people wont see this movie for what it really is. An immersive perspective from the killers point of view. It shows the realities of humanities worst kind.|, Finally a decent movie for the family|, This looks very interesting and quite promising, as it always is when it comes to Mr. Von Trier's works.
Also, it seems like Matt Dillon is finally getting the role he has long deserved.
I'm really glad for him, it was about time!
I've always thought he was hugely underrated and he never really got the chance to play a really 'dark' character like this one.
I'm definitely looking forward to watch this.|, Just watched it. Very unique, interesting and well acted. It felt like a completely new type of film. The murders are very intense and uncomfortable, which may turn a lot of people off. Some very memorable scenes, whether you want them to be or not. Reminded me of American Psycho but more dark and visceral."

The movie looks potentially awesome!  Cate Blanchett and Jack Black together?  I'm soooo at this!|, My dad is Brad Strickland, who continued the Bellairs series after John Bellairs passed away. The film producers were kind enough to invite my family to the set to see the production in progress. I was absolutely astounded by the detail -- I've been on film sets before and usually when you get up close everything looks really fake. This one didn't. It was clear the set design, props and costume departments had all gone to incredible lengths to make the film look special. I got to see a really cool scene being shot (there's a tiny glimpse of it in this trailer). Obviously that was before any effects or processing could be done to the movie. This trailer looks fantastic. I love the tone. I can't wait to see the movie!|, Whoever hired Eli Roth to direct this is an absolute madman in the best possible way.|, OMG I literally got emotional during this trailer!!! This was a book I grew up reading. It's one of the few books I read as a kid that I'd gladly reread, and now that it's a movie I might just do that. This book actually inspired the way I viewed Harry Potter when that came out. So I find the comments funny that say it reminds them of Harry Potter, because Harry Potter reminds me of this. 😂😂😂|, It was such a fun read and Jack Black and Cate Blanchett are perfectly cast.|, I just watched this movie and it was beautiful I recommend it for anyone who likes horror,  fantasy,  and comedy|, I'm excited for this. They filmed really close by. They had a house painted just for the movie, rented it out for filming, and then repainted it back to its original color before giving it back to the owners. Was a pretty neat sight.|, I LOVED the books as a kid. I didn't even know this was being considered for adaptation but when I heard ""Do you hear the ticking"", saw a gothic looking house, and the name Lewis I nearly fell out of my seat in the theater in excitement that it may be The House with a Clock in Its Walls. I've read all of the John Bellairs novels many times and still have my copies.  This comes out 5 days before my birthday and I couldn't ask for a better birthday present.|, Might be a bit assumptive of me, but looks like Roth and the Production Design team took great care in nailing the aesthetic look of a Bellairs' book.  Lots of woodwork, gothic and vintage pieces he adorned his stories with.  I'm loving this.|, I read the first two books of this series and I'm excited for this.  It's about time that they make a movie based on the book."

He could play a villian in any movie. Happy to see him coming up.|, Alexander Skarsgård is so funny in this movie!! I hope he does more comedies!|, Love your work!!!! Please keep us to date with good movies aka Keep it UP :)|, Wow. This movie is more than I expected it to be. I must say though that each time something went wrong I was like PLZ can he at least succeed in the end.|, Execs: For this character, we need an actor who can deliver his lines really fast and in a monotone way and do things that make him look and sound really smart: 

intern: Jesse Eisenberg.|, I took me a lot longer than it should have to spot Skarsgard! Amazing transformation.|, I already watched this film at TIFF, Salma Hayek and Alexander are superb.|, Skarsgard performance really makes this film, the whole cast is great, but his character alone is worth watching the film|, Can't wait to watch this. This has that 21 , Social Network, The Big Short kind of vibe."
The Hundred-Foot Journey,The Hundred-Foot Journey Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Helen Mirren Movie HD,MWo67uhzoQg,1483342,10139,282,"This is an old fashioned ""feel good"" movie with a happy ending. It shows that love knows no racial lines or boundaries..and that you must follow your dreams no matter what. The lead actor Manish Dayal is incredibly handsome and a real pleasure to watch.|, One of the best feel good movies I've seen. It played on late night Star Movies, and felt in love with the story.|, What a wonderful movie .. almost had tears in my eyes. A must watch|, Nothing wrong with a feel good movie, with one of the greatest actors~|, Very well made film with a perfect cast. In love with the lead guy's acting.|, This is such a beautiful film.. Just watched it today.. The music, the visuals, the story.. Everything is great ❤❤❤|, Love and food. What can be better. Such a beautiful film.|, I'll never forget this movie 
We watched it in our cookery class back in highschool and I really love the story|, This movie was amazing...a great journey of food, love & culture...❤️❤️❤️|, Awesome movie absolutely loved the cast and story❤️"

Amazing film.|, Randomly, out of no where, I just wanted to watch this trailer again. I've watched all the movies, several times. I've even read the books. And up until this day this still gives me chills. I miss when hunger games was more significant.|, Im definitely NOT the only one who got chills watching this trailer|, This movie was so similar to the book, I loved all the details, this director is great!|, I remember watching this trailer for the first time last year and hyperventilating like crazy. This, is definitely the best trailer out of all of the movies. The background music and the placing of scenes from the movie were genius. I have goose bumps right now. |, I'm 21 years old now. I have seen many movies from many different genres. All I can say is that being a 13/14 and seeing this movie in the CINEMA was one of the greatest cinematic moments in my life.|, Prim: since the last games something's been different I can see it 
Katniss: what can you see 
Prim: Peeta's hotter|, Almost 7 years later and I still get goosebumps|, Wait, so you're saying that it's NOT 2013 anymore? I swear, just a month ago, I was watching this film with my friends in the theaters.|, Such a good series. It felt weird this year not having a Hunger Games movie to go see.."

I'm glad they made it into two parts even if this one had barely any action. Really just shows how much she actually did love Peeta and a great build up for the ending :) 
I just wish I didn't have to wait so long for the next movie! I can't wait!|, Is anyone else watching these movies for the first time in 2020? 😅

Edit: I actually forgot about this comment, it feels like I’ve been a fan for years now (I ended up reading the books shortly after I finished the movies). But wow seriously, it’s legit been a full year since I became a thg fan wow-|, Saddest, most heartbreaking book of the three.|, ""You will rescue Peeta at the earliest opportunity, or you will find another Mockingjay.""
Jennifer Lawrence nailed that line!|, I can't even begin to say how much these books mean to me. In the hardest times of my life, Katniss drove me to keep going. I don't know where I'd be with out them.|, I'm just gonna admit it, SUZANNE COLLINS IS THE BEST PERSON ON EARTH, i wish for this series will go on and on and never ends :)))))))|, I watched the movie today and it was completely stunning. I was just in awe by everyone's incredible acting, the pace was just right, it was a million million times better than the book and I""m just blown away. I would recommend it to everyone!|, This movie was so good it's different from the others but it was so much better than I expected, I think that all the action and feelings will be on the part 2, this one is like the beginning of the end.

About her family, her love for Peeta and Gale, her breakdowns and  her shining moments. All real relatable thoughts. The books depicts how far a mind can twist in the face of diversity and pain.|, I don’t care if it’s 2019, I will forever love the hunger games|, 2021 - Still can’t get over the Hunger Games|, It's funny how it all came to turn.

The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes (2023) Official Trailer 2,NxW_X4kzeus,26427280,97785,8411,"Suzanne Collins really dropped a series that shaped a whole generation, disappeared, and appears again with another hit. This woman is like the equivalent of Adele.|, ""You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" Villain origin stories are always so compelling.|, I find that its pure genius that Suzanne Collins had the idea to tie Snow to the mockingjay before Katniss was even born like imagine Snow having to listen to katniss singing the hanging tree after all this years when Lucy Gray sang it about him|, Just watched the movie and wow. It’s amazing and really shows every aspect of all the characters showing how mad all of them went kind of reflecting our world today. You can really see how Katniss was Snows karma 70 years later. Her name, her song, her symbol, and her situation with Peeta. Katniss is basically Lucy coming back to haunt Snow. That’s why snow said at the end of a movie “I hated you from the moment your name was drawn” Katniss was one of Lucy’s songbirds in a way|, OK But can we talk about how Viola Davis utterly DEVOURED every scene she was in?! What an iconic performance.|, Just watched the movie premiere. I have been a big fan since I watched the hunger games in high school 10 years ago and this movie is the perfect prequel: the chilling origin story, the cinematography, the allusions to Katniss, the fashion, the songs. It finally made sense, how _it’s the things we love most, that destroy us._|, This book was ACTUALLY a decent prequel and a decent villian backstory. Truly proves protagonist doesn’t mean good guy, just main character. Excited to see this on the big screen.|, What I love about this book is that if you’ve read the 48 Laws of Power by Robert Green, you can predict the roles each character will play around Coriolanus because patterns of human behavior are evident in their actions. So even before a major betrayal occurs, you know who it’s most likely to come from and why. Snow plays chess with others emotions, carefully crafting his words and actions in order to always land on top. Brilliant book and the movie looks like it will capture the same energy in a faithful manner.|, ""it's the thing that we love the most which destroy us"" 

IT HITS HARDER AND HARDER. IT'S GIVING ME GOOSEBUMPS. WELL DONE|, I've seen this movie yesterday and i'm still shook although it might seem like a dystopian fantasy, it feels so relevant to present day events... the parallels are insane"
The Hunt,The Hunt – International Trailer (Universal Pictures) HD,xoWmwsPU5cQ,3204327,17568,2103,"Love that everyone here is saying good things about this movie, it definitely deserved much higher reviews. Betty Gilpin was phenomenal!|, Just finished watching this movie. I'd give it 5/5 stars. The unpredictability of this thriller was PHENOMENONAL. The writing, direction, cinematography and of course everyone's acting was top notch.|, This movie was wild from beginning to end.  Everything I thought was going to happen didnt and things I never expected to happen did. Awesome movie, worth watching|, This movie is so underrated it’s insane, I absolutely love this movie. The action and the main character is just so good and so fun to watch I love this movie.|, I saw it today, for a scary/fun movie to see with your friends 10/10. I couldn't believe how good it was.|, This movie was amazing. The fight scenes gave me early 2000’s Tarantino vibes. Loved it.|, Absolutely amazing movie, it's insane that is not well-known, I cant believe how underrated this movie is. Fantastic performances  great plot, thrilling and funny. Just wow!|, Words can't even begin to describe how much I love this movie!!!|, I love this movie for a bunch of reasons 1. Betty Gilpin's character Crystal is a total insane bad-ass 2. There is a lot of non stop violent action scenes 3. Hilary Swank plays a villainess in the movies I've seen her in she plays the heroine. 4. The first time you watch this movie you trying to figure who are the hunters and who are the hunted and last 5. It deals with one small political idea or a small joke can set off a dangerous chain of events.  Overall give this movie a chance and see if you love it or hate the first time I watch this movie I didn't think much of it but I learned to love it and many people will too  I give this movie 👍👍|, At first I though oh no, what crap am I watching but it got better and better as it went on. This movie is incredible. Definitely one of my favourite. Had me laughing all way through. Gave me  ready or not vibe. Worth a watch. Also the main actresses did an amazing job. The whole movie is worth watching just for the ending scenes"
The Hunting Ground,THE HUNTING GROUND - Official Trailer,GBNHGi36nlM,1518813,6059,1332,"when i was raped by a fellow student, i felt so incredibly alone. i didnt know what i was supposed to do, who i was supposed to talk to. the administration treated me like a burden for wanting to get support or justice. i am so so so thankful for this documentary, as horrifying as its implications are, because i know now that im not alone. watching all of these people share their stories, as well as all of the ones who talked to andrea and annie, was heartbreaking but also so powerful. because regardless of what other people say to us or about us, we always take care of each other. i could not have healed without the support of other survivors|, This documentary was amazing. The responses these victims got when they filed made me feel sick. This problem needs to stop and it needs to stop NOW.|, I love how whenever a film like this comes out a bunch of people (mostly men) start up on how ""feminism is making money off of this"" or ""Another feminist film making men look bad"". This isn't about making men look bad, it's about stopping a very serious and very real issue by putting it under a stage light for everyone to see. Because guess what, that's what it takes for these issues to really get noticed.|, I went to an all girls high school with a partner boys school on the same campus. We had a lot of classes and activities together. During my last few years of high school, the dynamic between the two schools was tense. There were several sexual assault accusations that made it to national news. It was very toxic. The guys didn’t have required health and sexual wellness classes outside of one class in 7th grade, while the girls school had it every year. During my last week in high school, the guys and girls were supposed to have a joint sexual assault education presentation to prepare us for some realities of college. The boys school backed out due to a scheduling conflict. So I, along with my fellow classmates at the girls school, attended the sexual assault presentation, while the boys attended career day. I still can’t believe how incredibly insane that event was—especially because after a different sexual assault activity about date rape, I learned that several boys from my class were unaware that sleeping with someone under the influence was rape.|, I am SO proud of this. I am appalled at how easily rapists can get away with their disgusting crime, and then have the victim face all of the punishment. It's absurd and infuriating. I hope this gets a lot of coverage because it is a very real issue that has very real and detrimental consequences.|, Not in college, but I've been assaulted by four different men.  The first time I was 3.  There is something missing with these types of people.  Seriously, for the doubters, it's more rampant than you think and these people don't rehabilitate.  Get a grip, be aware, teach your daughters and sons to protect themselves, and please listen to them over any institution.|, This film is amazingly well done. It sheds a bright light on this problem, and makes the watcher feel something.|, this is so true.Universities just cover things up not to ruin their reputation. This is so true. I have no idea if this only goes about undergraduate programs or also grad students. Because this happens a lot for those in masters and even phd level. Add to this that at some phd and masters level some students are international students and they have literally no one to tell about this. So sad.|, As a college student, I can say this documentary really highlights the fear many college girls feel. Whenever I go out, me and my girlfriends make a plan to stick together, to help each other against unwanted attention. We carry pepper spray, have taken self defense classes, and do anything we can to make sure we all stick together. It's disgusting that we have to take all these precautions when we go out at night. I've already met a good number of girls on my own dorm who have been raped in the past and had to listen to them talk about how slow their recovery was. They are not at fault. Their rapist is. The victim is never at fault, but many Universities fail to understand this. Instead of helping the victims, they push them down and hide their stories all for the sake of their reputation. Rape on campus needs to become a national issue.|, This is some scary stuff. So far in my life (I'm only 20) I have been friends with three rape victims. All were assaulted as children, and one was assaulted last year and she's too scared to tell anyone because the guy is an athlete. This is my worst fear. I shouldn't have to feel scared to go to college where I come to learn, make friends, and yes have some fun and be afraid that someone somewhere will take advantage of me or other girls, because I chose to go to a party or wanted to be cute and wear a nice skirt or dress. What people are wearing should NOT be a damn ticket to getting off for this gross crime. I don't care if someone was drunk or under the influence of any drug. No means no! And the lack of the word ""yes"", still means no.  That person doesn't owe you shit because you bought them something, because you're friends or dating, hell, even if you're _married_ to that person. Seriously, when will this epidemic stop? No one ever drops their kids off at uni expecting them to be harmed in anyway."

The ending was simultaneously exhilarating and heartbreaking. The ending made me cry my eyes out. Someone who reshaped our entire modern era had such a tragic end. Truly a remarkable story and this movie did it justice.|, This was the first Benedict Cumberbatch movie I ever saw, and this movie made him one of my favorite actors. I absolutely love this movie.|, We need more movies like that about REAL heroes. Alan Turing was one of the great unrecognized geniuses of the 20th century. His contributions have made for a better world and better life for all mankind.|, Benedict Cumberbatch. Pretty much the perfect actor for this genius role|, Those who haven't seen this, they MUST watch it. It is seriously a good movie!

Cumberbatch is perfect for the role.|, I've just watched this movie. Benedict is a superb actor to play the role of Alan Turing. The movie was amazing to watch & gives us an incredible insight, not only about the man who was a genius, but how Alan Turing's machine introduced us to what we use today.

I loved Marion Cotillard's role.|, Such a beautifully underrated film|, joaquin phoenix is such a badass|, The soundtrack alone is amazing.|, The cinematographer has my vote.|, There should be more films of this calibre- just me- prone to moodiness. I find currently, late summer of 2022, a real lack, the opposite of surfeit- of good flicks- these actors, Marion Cotillard and Joachim Phoenix are so- can't find words these days, covidium reclusium- lack of use leads to loss of- both are so accomplished- you can ""dress them up or down"" - they are both such wonderful CHARACTER ACTORS- maybe that's what I'm trying to express.

Incredible acting. I was sobbing.|, Tom Holland should have gotten nominated for an Oscar for this movie. He did such an utterly fantastic job and made me cry so much.|, This movie is incredible. Tom truly did a great job acting. It’s a very heartwarming story. I spent the entire movie crying, and the fact that it was based off a true story made it more heartwarming. Truly a miracle that the whole family survived 🥺|, My mom,  sis, and dad were in this tsunami. Thankfully, they all survived|, Recently just finished watching this in geography class, I must say most touching movie ever! I was the only one in the room sobbing nearly every scene, but well worth the embarrassment! The fact it was based on a true story really touched me, outstanding movie! 100% recommend, the boy who played Lucus deffo deserves a Oscar! Brilliant acting from all!|, Guys, I just watched the movie and wow I’m touched, it’s so beautiful (no spoilers), and so much perseverance! So much! And the fact that it’s a true story just melts my heart even more, I heard that in the real life situation over a quarter of a million died is this tsunami! God bless everyone who went through that situation! God bless you, now I’m not gonna lie , if I didn’t know that it was a true story I wouldn’t have cried. But, because it was true it really touched my heart. Now I have been in a tsunami a very little one and I almost shattered my leg, because I saw all the water in the sea disappearing and I was thinking ‘What is going on hear’? And I looked closer. Big mistake when you see the water disappearing , you run and run and run and run until you physically can’t go any more, I have done years and  years of training with my personal trainer. So I ran for my life, picked up my litter brother and sister and ran. I shouted for my parents to run and they did so. The tsunami hit me hit me hard, I nearly shattered my left leg, however my right leg broke, I’m fine now because that was 1 year ago. But I covered my siblings bodies under my’n to protect my family. For me nothing can over top love and family. If you red all this you are a true trooper and a powerful person.|, I just watched this movie, and I recommend it to anyone that is considering, or even not considering watching it. It is full of so many heart wrenching moments. The fact that it is a true story just makes it so much more devastating. You feel the pain of the people in the story, and more importantly you also feel the love and the compassion of the people as well. What got to me the most in this film was the eldest son Lucas and his mother. The amount of love and care that they have for one another, and the strength they give one another throughout the film is heart stoppingly beautiful. You can almost feel the amount of love that is shown in this movie. By far my new favourite.|, The acting in this movie was phenomenal.  What a horrendous experience they all went through.|, I don't cry easily at movies, but this one really got to me. All of the performances were well done, but I remember watching this and the scene with the brothers reuniting was the most emotional scene of the entire movie for me. I only now realize that the oldest son, the one who made me cry, is Tom Holland! He is such a fantastic actor and I hope that he receives all of the praise and choice of roles that is sure to come his way after Spider-Man.|, This is honestly one of the most heartbreaking movies I've watched, literally in tears every five minutes"

As compared to other spoofs that has to be sexualised, its a pity it didn't do great in the charts.|, ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" is going to be in movie theaters this weekend.

She stayed out of controversies and wasn’t addicted to the glamour of Hollywood.|, Literally my favorite horror movie.

I consider her performance in ""The Innocents"" the greatest performance in her career.  It has no equal.|, Just finished reading The Turn of the Screw. I am BLOWN AWAY at this adaptation. What a great film.|, Such a disaster!!! Well, it happens when you give a crazy person full authority over 2 innocent kids 😑 This movie is a masterpiece and needs to be watched more than once for sure!

It's fantastic, Deborah Kerrs' performance is outstanding, not to mention the child actors too. 

This is the most unique use of sound I have ever heard within the use of film. 

If you love this film as I do, then you love Night of the Hunter, starring Robert Mitcham. 

These two films, The Innocents and Night of the Hunter, are both classics, beautifully created, and very underrated horror movies."

5 minutes into the movie and i'm already engrossed. The story plot was simply amazing, showing how deep their relationship is because of how much time they have spent together. Also, showing how everyone has a story behind the laughter and smile.
If anyone has movies similar to this, please recommend them to me.|, I've just watched this movie and all I can say is that I was in tears at times since it's packed with scenes which make you want to roll around the floor in laughter and cry as the relationship between Philippe and Driss evolves. In short one of the best films I've seen for ages and unlike a lot of films it was 2 hours of my life very, very well spent :-)|, I can't remember the last time I was so touched by a movie. A fantastic story presented with incredible acting and plot,based on true events. A story that brilliantly represents the connection between two living characters,not just employer-employee. Very profound,touching movie. Recommending it to everyone!|, Man how time flies. I watched this nearly 10 years ago now in French class. Honestly I didn’t care for French much but I enjoyed that class so much because of that teacher. I hope he is in a good place right now and that he leads a happy life. I know you probably won’t see this too but just in case you do mr Kearney I just wanted say what an amazing teacher you were and you probably don’t even realise how much of an impact you had on my life and others from that class. Honestly taught us so many life lessons and looking back your classes were one of my biggest highlights throughout the 5 years I spent at secondary school. There’s really not many teachers like you out there!|, Im the type of guy who'd rather watch ufc fights and go through a rocky balboa marathon...but this. This movie is a masterpiece!|, This was such a good film. It was surprisingly really funny, without cliché humour, while still carrying genuine heartfelt moments that you will remember the next time you think about life and love. This movie really changed how I see friendships, other-abled people, and having fun. I will always recommend this film 👍|, This is without doubt the best and most moving movie I have ever seen, coming from a 17 year old girl. I have watched it three times and cried every single time. This is absolutely worth watching, I almost feel sorry for all of those who has not seen it, you really don't know what you're missing!|, This movie was awesome!  I don't often particularly like ""heart-warming"" or ""uplifting"" sorts of movies that much b/c they usually seem cheesy to me, but I did not think the Intouchables was corny or cheesy... I laughed a lot and the humor seemed so natural, not contrived like in a lot of movies (sometimes I find myself asking, ""would anyone REALLY say or do that?"").  And I liked seeing how they became an unlikely pair of really good friends.  I don't think I ever felt happier watching a movie. |, My dad introduced me to this almost two months ago. Safe to say it's become one of my favourite films of all time and I'm not overexaggerating. It's a genuine 10/10 movie.|, I have seen the movie maybe 25 times with my French classes as a French teacher.  First time in my career I saw the kids APPLAUD at the end of the movie!"

All the little things he did to torture her leading up to the ending. Including hitting Sidney. Details were very well thought out and not always expected. Love how it stayed on topic as far as showing how obsessed he was with her.|, Elisabeth Moss killed it! Her acting is on another new level!|, Easily one of the best psychological thrillers I’ve ever seen, the camera work and sound effects were just flawless!|, If you want to see just how dangerous it is to push a person too far, then this movie is for you. Elisabeth Moss was in a different level in this movie. Gritty riveting thriller all round ❤|, He mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that he became invisible to the eye.|, Just watched this movie with my boyfriend, for everyone saying that the trailer gave away the whole movie, I PROMISE there is so much more to this movie than you think. We went into this movie ready to talk shit, we left with our jaws wide open. My boyfriend even said it’s the best movie he’s seen in a few years|, This movie is brilliantly made and acted. A very psychologically disturbing concept that'll leave you  with a raised heart rate during every scene|, This is the first time where I found myself rooting for the main character in a while! Amazing movie with amazing plot line as well! EVERYONE should watch it. Spectacular"

I was expecting it to be horrible because of reviews and the comment section here, BUT, it was actually great! I loved every minute. It's not really hardcore horror. It has some horror scenes here and there but if you want non-stop blood, intestines and gore then this is not for you. This movie builds up in a mysterious, bizarre and flirtacious way. I kept wondering what was coming next. The main actrice did a wonderful job too, you start rooting for her. Very fun and interesting concept with plenty of twists. Also a stunning cast.

Producers: Yes|, So basically it’s like ready or not but with vampires this time. Alright I guess I’ll watch it. Been a while since we’ve seen a good vampire horror movie|, This feels like Ready or Not with Samara Weaving so can't wait for it!|, I watched this trailer after seeing it in the theaters and I'm so glad I did, actually being surprised when the family turned out to be who they where felt nice I recommend going and seeing movies without seeing trailers and or having no knowledge about the film.

The Judge,The Judge - Official Trailer [HD],ZBvK6ni97W8,8486346,63000,2274,"Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, Lawyer|, this is a hell of a movie, no CG, no boobs, no sarcasm, straight acting skills and playwrighting, the emotions penetrate so deep inside which left me silent for several hours after watching and still cant pull myself out of the movie. this is one of those underrated movies u have to see.|, This movie is super underrated it’s just a nice break from the Marvel universe and it just shows how diverse and great of an actor Robert Downey Jr. is|, Well... I think this movie is a little masterpiece. We need more movies like this one. The story around the trial grabs you and keeps you watching and the whole picture they painted with this familiy is very touching and just well done. There is so much honesty in the acting and in the dynamic of the characters. I suppose the story about this family really comes from the heart. And those two big components really are a combination that I would just call great taste. Hats off... this is art and we need more of it.|, Even acting as a lawyer, he still has the Tony Stark thing going on..|, Ya'll can tell how close to the heart this project is to Robert. And it definitely shows in the acting. The court scene at the end, the scene in the kitchen, the hospital scene; I was overall just mezmerized. They did such an amazing job with the movie. Too bad it didn't get as much recognition as it should have. But this was fucking amazing, and it's now my favourite movie ever. Got all emotional and shit, it hit me deep down— the family issues, quite the unlucky life, all that. It's just so. And Robert did a good fucking job like he always have with his movies. Super proud to be his duckling. ❤️|, Its amazing how diverse of an actor RDJ is. He can still take his comedic timing into a drama movie such as this and still convey the emotions necessary to garner the feels meant to be. Truly one of the greater actors of our generation, I truly believe it is worth watching every movie he is in because he is one of the few who can carry a movie by hisself.|, I just watched the movie and I had to say it left me quite speehless. It made me realize how, even law itself, can be shaken by the subjectivity of the people under it. It made me realize that human's emotions are so complicated, thus resulting in things they didn't actually want to do or cause. And honestly Robert in this was very superb; I saw sides of him I never saw in his role as Iron Man. Being a shady lawyer, a broken son of an equally broken father yet also a warm father to his daughter, a considerate brother to his siblings, and a lost man who never really moved on from his high school sweetheart, all of those sides at once. No wonder why he is one of world's A-list actors.|, I like how the trailer at first makes you think it's another Robert Downey Jr, comedy film but then as it progresses you begin to realize how dramatic this film is.|, This movie is an American classic for me.  The acting is first rate by our best actors. 
This movie has so much to say!
Two principled men of two different spectrums. 
Robert Downey Jr., and Robert Duval give stellar performances.
This movie is an all time favorite🏆"

Crew: Say no more.|, This gem of a film does the psycho thriller genre justice. The atmosphere is suffocating, i was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film & when it ended, i honestly couldn't quite figure out what to think of it but the way it's crafted is pure brilliance. Complimenti to everyone involved for a bold piece of cinematic work. I've watched the lobster & liked it a lot but this one is on another level, subtle, creepy, horrifying & so very engaging.|, Now this is how you make a trailer.For once it doesn`t give the whole plot away.|, This is an excellent movie. It's also a conversation piece meaning it encourages people to talk, to exchange ideas and reactions about the movie. Not just did you like the movie or director but the concept as a whole. Many people no matter how hardcore horror fans they are do not watch movies that harm children or animals. This was a bold choice; shocking but perfect. I'm partial to horror that ends the 'wrong' way. If you liked this make sure to watch A Cure for Wellness, and The Invitation there is gore and the psychological aspect as well.

Editing a year later based upon a comment that some don't like gratuitous sex in movies like this. While it's no porno, this movie is meant to make you uncomfortable and the scenes are definitely WTF scenes but in a way that speaks of character dysfunction. There's also a wanking episode described in explicit icky detail that gave me nightmare fuel for months.|, Zero gore, zero jump scares yet still one of the most horrifying movies I've ever seen, if you're on the fence about it dont be, it is so worth the watch if you enjoy movies that are both mundane yet horrific|, The soundtrack, cinematography and overall direction is what makes this film a modern day pyschological masterpiece. I'd say the script reads pretty normal or atleast not as crazy as the film|, I swear A24 puts out the best trailers. Love them. This trailer is fantastic and the movie looks great. Cannot wait.|, This looks amazing. Such a fan of all of the work Lanthimos has produced thus far. I am already enthralled. Knowing so little, my mind is already doing gymnastics. Also, to snag Nicole is already reason enough to watch. The Lobster had a sort of vignette feel, like reading a short story that existed in another reality not to different from our own, but without the grandiose explanations mainstream media is so fixated on whenever exploring fantasy or sci fi (simple minds need rationalizing). However arthouse this is, it looks to be the most grounded in reality to come from the director. I'm excited to see his growth.|, One of the coolest trailers I’ve seen. It instantly made me want to see the film. Once I did, I was blown away at how good it is.|, Always coming back to see the masterpiece this trailer is, it give me goosebumps everytime. Such an excellent movie"

This movie is so inspiring !|, This definitely is one of the best movies you could see, preferably with friends. It's very deep, and pretty much sums up the teenage angst present in the youth of today. Also it underlines a very deep connection between man and nature, a boy and freedom. This was never a blockbuster smash hit, nor was it ever meant to be a trivial search and rescue movie. This was art.|, A must-watch movie. Definitely one of the best I've watched in recent times.

Edit: cant believe so many people still love this movie ‘23❤|, I like the scene with the fathers bonding realizing they’re not perfect as parents but they love their children more then anything.

I checked it out because it was suggested on a list of movies with skateboarding (I'm a huge skate nerd) and was more than blown away. Daewon Song makes a cameo too!

The final duel was so tense I was literally on the edge of my seat|, Great story, gorgeous photography and costumes, masterful direction and of course, superb acting. People praise mostly Comer and Driver's performances (no doubt they are great in the film) but I was really blown away by Matt's performance playing a grim, rough, furious, almost barbaric character, very unlike his personality and most of the roles he has been playing throughout his career.

All cast did amazing performance.|, I have never felt so seen watching a movie before and all of that is thanks to Jodie Comer’s masterfully nuanced and emotionally wrecking performance. My husband who rarely pays attention to movies was crying by the end of it. She truly deserves an Oscar!!! Brilliant.|, so happy to see Jodie up there with some big names, her talent speaks for itself and she really deserves this!|, It's such a shame not too many people went to see this movie.

Saw lots of WIA/KIA buddies,and we always made sure they were appropriately recognized for their bravery.|, I served in the US Air Force from 1999 - 2014 and I've always read about the heroics of Pitsenbarger throughout my career.  It's something that Airmen will never forget when they are serving.  Pitsenbarger was the true definition of service before self. His MoH citation was something truly inspirational to read when I questioned myself as to why I chose to serve.|, Legitimately just saw the trailer on tv and I’m here now, watching again, and also doing research on this fallen hero. Thank you to all of the men and women who have sacrificed their lives for this country and RIP.|, I'm always concerned about true stories being made into movies etc as they can go so wrong but from what I've seen and heard, they got this one right and I plan to watch it while I've got time off this week. Congratulations to the cast and to Pits' family on his story being told so we can all honour him and all the men of Vietnam|, Pits is an icon, especially in the Air Force. They taught us his selflessness and service before self. The epitome of the Air Force. His blood is stained on the uniform that threads together to this day.|, What a hero. I'm glad his parents were still alive when he receive it post humously. What a man. If all men had even a peppering of this man's bravery, integrity and empathy, this country would look very different. Hell, the world would look different. Thank you to William Parker Hayes Jr. who also helped with the process. He died ""unexpectedly"" one year after Pitsenbarger received the award at the age of 36. Strange. Strange to think in a world where the men who do good die and are considered trouble makers sometimes. It's upside down here. It's all gone wrong.|, Just found this on Netflix, wow what a tear jerker and beautiful ending.
Massive respect for all you vets, I don't know how you do it.|, I have seen this movie at an early viewing and it is excellent. All of the actors were first rate and from what the director and producers said all of them did it at a very low rate. There were very few dry eyes in the theater during the viewing. The portrayals of the Vietnam vets was very moving and gives you the tiniest of glimpse into the pain/trauma a lot of them suffer through.

One single chapter has enough things in it to make up its own horror story. This is one of the books I wouldn't even be against splitting into multiple parts. Jonathan Harker's stay at Dracula's castle, the voyage of the Demeter, Dracula turning Lucy into a vampire, the heroes chasing Dracula back to his castle, all of that can very well fill many movies.|, The absolute best aspect of Stoker's novel is the episodes of unnamed, unsaid horrors. Demeter is not merely a vessel for transportation of evil. Based off of the captain's log book entries, the reader only imagines the travails of the passengers aboard that ship.  And now we have a live- action representation of that. Can not wait. Dracula- the name is enough.|, The biggest thing I loved about this film was how it depicted Dracula as the monster! Many other Hollywood films depicted Dracula is a well manner, gentlemen who looks innocent at first, but later we see the monster when he strikes his victims. And that's leads many to believe that Dracula is a man who can take the form of a monster....

But this films shows you that Dracula is really a monster who can take the form of a man and the film does an amazing job of showing you that! Plus, love the very thin personality that gave him where its not distracting, but gives the film that extra kick!|, The meeting of Harker and Dracula in Transylvania and him becoming Dracula’s prisoner and nearly being consumed by Dracula’s wives and the account of the Demeter voyage are probably my favorite chapters from the Stoker novel. 
There are some other memorable ones such as Dracula and his turning of Lucy among others, but for me the Harker/Demeter chapters are the very best.|, I’m personally hoping that the batlike form isn’t the only form Dracula takes in this film. I’m hoping we see him take mist form, wolf form, and particularly I hope he takes a form that’s human enough in appearance that he can disguise himself as one of the crew.|, Stoker's an absolute genius for going through this story within the novel. That crew's perspective was a brilliant view to explore! I just wish the trailer didn't reveal so much for people who haven't watched it yet. The human mind tends to have more fear for things that it doesn't see because it's unable to comprehend what it's yet to behold.|, That chapter regarding the ship in the Dracula book always was one of the most terrifying and heartbreaking parts of the story.|, This trailer was done so damn well. The clips they chose the knocking on the wood being simultaneous throughout it, the music and song choice. I love when a trailer is done well|, I’m not sure why this movie hasn’t done well at the box office. I saw it last night with my niece and we both enjoyed it. It tells part of the story of Dracula from a different angle than we usually see. I always thought the chapter in the original book that this draws from was one of the best parts in the book.|, This looks fantastic! Can't wait to see it. Love the idea of taking a small part of the book Dracula and making an entire movie out of it. And the creature makeup looks incredible."
The Last Witch Hunter,The Last Witch Hunter (2015) Official Trailer – &quot;Live Forever&quot; - Vin Diesel,xsuG2JUgs_8,12671890,27206,1859,"I actually like this movie. Would love for a sequel. To be quite honest I'm tired of all these superhero movies or any other generic rehashed stuff. This movie felt fresh too me. Not overly saturated In action and not too over bearing in dialog scenes. It felt like it had a good mixture and the magic felt realistic.|, It aches my heart that films such as this one aren't more appreciated by the industry. It's not perfect, but so much potential. Finding a good fantasy film is hard now-a-days, and this just felt fresh. 7.5/10, but only because I would have liked more depth.|, Vin Diesel is probably the only man alive to ever have the privilege of actually becoming his Dungeons & Dragons character.|, I’ve finally watched this movie 5 yrs after its release, and I can’t believe I didn’t watch it then. So freaking good. Loved every minute of it. So well done and the cgi graphics were amazing even now.|, It's such a shame that this movie never gathered a huge following it's fun and has lots of materials for people to play around with|, This movie has everything: guns, swords, witchcraft, fire, fast cars, badass Vin Diesel, the good ol' Michael Caine, Rose Leslie, Elija Wood - and a trailer that's not already telling us the whole plot of the movie - looks kind of promising.|, Definitely one of the perfect roles for Vin Diesel! And the plot, itself, looks really interesting! I can't wait to see this movie! Come at me, hipsters!|, Cannot wait for this movie.  Straight out of Vin Diesel's D&D playing days.  You know he'll have put a lot into this movie, as it's based on something he's passionate about.|, What's cool is that almost EVERY person Vin Diesel  plays is either strong, fearless or straight up cool. (Fast & Furious franchise , Guardians of the Galaxy, XXX, etc.)|, Just watched this movie yesterday not knowing what to expect and no high hopes. I was surprised this is actually
a very good movie, good acting very good fantasy and special effects. If you are into witches and witchcraft fast
passed story and action this is movie for you. I recommend and actually like this one."
The Last Word,Watch The Last Word With Lawrence O’Donnell Highlights: Nov. 30,Voq6XzcrX3w,76903,2600,324,"Lawrence O'Donnell is an  American icon and its most masterful television journalist. I actually think that he is one of the very few examples within the public sphere that gives the United States of America and indeed the rest of the world hope that the stupidity and fascist proclivities of Trump and his MAGA minions will ultimately not prevail.|, ""A candidate under Federal investigation has no right to be running. It would be virtually impossible for a president under indictment to govern.""- Donald Trump, November 2016.|, Lock Trump up and be done with it, I am sick of him breaking the law over and over.|, Thank you Lawrence for speaking truth to your viewers!|, Lawrence,  you are the best! Democracy rules.😂|, I am dubious of the many ""charities"" on social media, however Lawrence O'Donnell's interview this morning was happiness and goodness personified.  Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell.|, Laurence, you have more integrity and humanity in one of your fingers than all the hypocrites you highlight in your show have, put together.
I salute you for all the work you do for the education of the children of Malawi, especially the girls, whose education is often an afterthought.
Be blessed 

Peace to all|, I would love the Republican base in this country to explain  how citizen trump rules and runs this country with out using the powers only afforded to a total dictator.|, Theres nothing better than hearing Lawrence say stupid|, Left me speechless with the story of the shoes.

I wish there was another movie or series exploring the same concept.|, I've seen this in theaters, I loved it 7/10 rating for me. The best scary movie that I've seen in a long time!|, *** JUST WATCHED IT ***
I haven't experienced so much suspense and fear in years.
I'm happy I found this movie. I watched it from 1:30-3:00am in my room alone.

This movie is definitely one I'll recommend to anyone that likes horror movies.
This movie is one of those movies you re-watch a few times in a few years.

This film had a good mix of science, supernatural, mystery, horror, suspense.
Some parts looked like from horror games DOOM, Resident Evil, F.E.A.R,

Please don't let the critics' ratings deter you; they are wrong.
The movie grossed 10 times its cost, but due to critics saying it was bad, I only pray there's a sequel. 

Anyway, I'll be happy to read other's opinions on the movie.|, This movie was honestly really good! I had low expectations but it's great and I want to see it again|, Una película con Olivia Wilde y Evan Peters, algo más perfecto que esto? ♥|, Wish they would make a part 2 I love this movie|, Hands down one of the scariest movies I have ever seen in my entire life, a MUST WATCH! ❤️|, I just watched this. Loved it. Great cast and story. 💯|, Totally awesome film! Great dialogue! Loved it!|, I only now got to watch this. I love the twist at the ending. Great movie and would definitely recommend!"
The Legend of Hercules,The Legend Of Hercules Official Trailer #2 (2014) - Kellan Lutz Movie HD,jcdhyaP0T7g,12276662,34934,2771,"I actually just watched this movie. I thought that it was pretty good. The main thing that I liked the most about it was that it focused on the story behind Hercules and not just Hercules. The story gave voice to his brother, his mother, the stepfather, his woman, even his friend (s). It was a fleshed out story. I liked that change. |, I think they should make a movie about the story of Medusa. It has a good plot that they could branch off of in interesting ways and have more of the Greek Gods involved. |, This movie doesn't get enough credit, IT""S A GOOD MOVIE!!!|, I love this movie, it's so beautiful. It touches my heart. Liam garrigan was amazing, he really looked as if he were from another era, just like the actor who played hercules' slave/friend, he was brilliant, as kellan lutz. So many period movies look modern and hollywood-esque, which doesn't convey that old soul and an old world.  The dialogue in this movie isn,t shakesperean but it sounds ancient, which was awesome, movies like troy look and sound like a contemporary machine.  Another period movie that depicts the ancient era is Ironclad.|, This is one of those movies that will easily be forgotten by the end of the year.|, Before he was a legend , he was a cliff diver.|, Did u guys notice that in the duration of this trailer, the main character ""Hercules"" had basically no lines... Just intense stares and grunts|, This looks really good actually. And Kellan Lutz is perfect.|, Would be nice if they actually made a Hercules movie that depicted his 12 labours without it being screwed up by writers who didn't actually refer to the way it was actually written|, I haven't seen the movie, but- 'he was an ordinary man'. No, he was a demigod. Wasn't he? "
The Legend of Tarzan,The Legend of Tarzan - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],Aj7ty6sViiU,38317385,145833,11842,"Recently watched this movie for the first time and was really surprised how good it was, mixing historic facts with fiction as well as incorporating many things from the books.|, That is what I love about adventure movies. No matter how many movies were made or how many actors and actresses have played the characters the stories about them are outstanding every last one.|, I don't care what anyone says about the CGI and stuff.  this movie looks incredibly awesome.  I can't wait to see it.|, I really dont get how people are not liking this movie. It's awesome.|, Muito bom, já quero ver de novo!|, Although there was a whole lot of wishful thinking made in the writing of this movie, this actually turned out better than I expected. Yes, there were a few CGI mishaps but in my opinion, this was still in a way, quite remarkably epic. Very true to the Hollywood blockbuster formula. I like it.|, I just love how they made the movie they made all hard efforts on it and cost them a lot, I love the story too. The actors were great and the same with the film maker. I don't complain because I see the beauty in movies instead of the negatives all movies has it's style and twist. If you wanna be happy STOP COMPLAINING AND JUST APPRECIATE THINGS|, Freakin' awesome! Finally hope for a live action adaptation. Tarzan of the Apes was the first real book I ever read in my life. For me, being a child who was bullied, beaten and friendless. One who learned to read by looking at the pictures in comic books and then surmised the meaning of words. I found myself in Tarzan. A character who not only survived, under what I felt were very similar circumstances, but thrived. I'm so looking forward to this now. Thank you Warner Bros.|, This is the best movie I've ever seen in 2016! I saw this movie with my sister kendel & my mom, & kendel was holding my hand through the whole film. The audience was laughing at the funny scenes in this movie, & at the end of the movie the audience were actually clapping at the end of the film. I love everything about this film: this movie has a gigantic adventurous plot, the characters are outright brilliant, the musical score is emotional & fantastic, the CGI animals are very realistic at times, this movie has intense action, & it has gorgeous Cinematography. It's funny, emotional, intense, and heart-warming. I'm gonna give this film 5 out of 5 stars.|, It is a good action-adventure movie, that uses a different narrative from the original story, showing us the main character already in the present and using flashbacks to tell us his dramatic past. The lead actor, Alexander Skarsgard, gave us a pretty decent performance, just like his scene partner, Margot Robbie, and the well known Christoph Waltz. It's a decent rereading from an old and classic story, now using all technologies and computer graphics that helps to make a beautiful photography and nice special effects scenes. Although, I missed the Phill Collins remarkable soundtrack. If you are going to watch it, don't try to compare with any previous Tarzan's stories you may have seen or heard."

The cinematography, the story, everything is breathtaking.|, I was stunned by this movie. I found myself so involved in the decisions the characters made, feeling so sorry for them because the line between right and wrong can become so blurry when love is involved. So many decisions and sacrifices made for love. And it ends so poetically, just the way it should. Beautiful story in itself, and the way it was shot and the acting were just the icing on top.|, This is the type of movie that i'll only watch at home.not because it doesn't wort the money but because i don't want people to see me in public with my eyes cried out.|, I always avoided watching this movie because I thought it was boring, but today I gave it a chance because I had nothing else to watch, and let me tell you. It became one of my favourite movies. It inspired me, and made me cry for hours. It left a mark in both my heart and mind forever. What a beautiful masterpiece.|, Alicia Vikander and Michael Fassbender's baby will be genetically perfect.|, It has been a while since I was moved into tears by a real good movie. Beautiful story of love between husband and wife, parents and child, strangers to strangers, love and forgiveness. Excellent movie!|, A wonderful movie , a story about dilemmas , catch 22s and getting punished for wanting to give care and love for an innocent life , truly inspirational movie , the whole casts deserved Oscars for their roles|, I love the book so much, I've only read it eight times and it's never ceases to make me cry :)

The Lighthouse,The Lighthouse | Official Trailer HD | A24,Hyag7lR8CPA,13109293,168542,10679,"This movie has so many great quotes and its thick atmosphere makes it more memorable.|, The Academy should be embarrassed and ashamed for overlooking this masterpiece. The film, acting, and directing are absolutely phenomenal.|, I'll never forget seeing this in theaters. The constant loud, cacophonous drone of that fog horn echoing in my ears and vibrating in my chest... two extremely strong performances... unforgettable experience|, Still can’t believe there was only 1 single nomination for this masterpiece. Completely robbed. This movie was beyond brilliant and such pure genius.|, Absolute masterpiece. Shame yourself, Academy, how could you ignore such a brilliant movie?|, I went into this movie with zero expectations back in 2020. It was an absolute masterpiece. Truly terrifying, thought provoking, and relatable (since we were all in quarantine at the time). It’s been about two years since I watched it and it still sticks with me. It really captures that old school cinematography feeling|, Pattinson worked damn hard to shake off the filth of Twilight. He deserves and shines in all the amazing roles he's been receiving lately.|, Just watched The Lighthouse, probably one of the most creepiest and yet genius films I have ever seen.|, No jumpscares, no supernatural elements, yet i can't watch this again. A movie that can be interpreted in 1000 different ways yet still provide room for ambiguity. A movie that terrifies you with atmosphere, tone, claustrophobia and the creepiness of the foghorn wailing in the background. This movie affected me so much and is more effective and terrifying than any other cliched spooky costume ghost shits. The definition of a TRUE psychological horror.|, Dafoe/Pattison laughing hysterically under the table during the storm was absolute magic, I wanted to be there with them under that table"

Just really good acting.|, I read the book for the first time not too long ago and I ADORED it. I normally don't go see movie adaptations since I'm not into movies as much as I am into books. Though after seeing the trailer and seeing who is behind it, I will definitely be giving this one a viewing. I know many people get annoyed when they say read the book, but this is one where I can say you can read the book and, when it comes out, watch the movie. The book is amazing and, from what I'm getting from the trailer, this movie will be a worthwhile adaptation.|, Domhnall Gleeson is so underrated I hope this movie gets him recognized!!|, This was my first book I ever heard as an audiobook.

It is so so good. 10/10|, I can't describe the way this movie made me feel. Truly brilliant.|, Absolutely nothing could happen the entire movie, I can't stop watching. The dialogue alone is absolute captivating.|, This trailer is extremely misleading.

The Lodge,THE LODGE Official Trailer (2019) Riley Keough Horror Movie HD,dCLOqdzAP9E,5916064,60693,3921,"Damn, he lost his little brother, fought a demon clown, and now he's stranded in a haunted cabin in a blizzard.
This kid just can't get a break.|, This is what I call an intelligently directed movie.. no unending build up.. no jump scares, no scary costumes and it still fucks with your head|, I just watched this movie and really, really enjoyed it. It's not about jumpscares, it's an exercise in ever-growing suspense and uncertainty as a group of people dealing with heavy emotional traumas are faced with a creepy situation that keeps getting worse. The movie sets up several possible explanations for what's going on and keeps you guessing all the way until the final scene (which will be sticking with me for some time).

The performances are great across the board, especially from Riley Keough and the young actress who plays the daughter. The musical score is effectively tense and the sound and overall atmosphere is really strong. This was a well-crafted, dark little movie.|, Fantastic film that truly grasps the concept of and amazingly executes psychological horror. As a long-time horror fan who’s seen almost everything, it takes a lot to scare me nowadays, but this film had me on edge almost the whole time.|, no jump scares, no monster reveal. Holy shit I'm actually liking the sound of this.|, Really terrific movie with a dynamic I don't think I've encountered anywhere else. It's a scary movie without a boogeyman and unassuming characters with uncommon cruelty. Most horror movies end on the crescendo. This movie peaks early and then spirals you into a pit-of-your-stomach dread -- you know what's going to happen and you really don't want it to happen, and you have to watch it happen.|, Going to an isolated place for Christmas was never a great idea.|, This was honestly one of the scariest horrors I've seen in my life, was gripped the whole way through, lots of twists and the audio was bone chilling a true 10/10|, I just watched this last night and thought it was fantastic. It’s definitely a psychological thriller more than horror but I was mind blown at the twist. It plays your emotions well, by the end you don’t know who to feel sorry for- all of them, really. Tragic, suspenseful, original. I liked it a lot.|, Man the part with the little girl crying had me in tears. That girl did a great job in that scene. I was mad AF at the momma"

Nice to see it again after all these years.|, I've never seen anything like this... truly fantastic supernatural horror masterpiece|, Incredible gothic movie. Absolutely    loved it . Thank you for sharing.  ❤😢|, In the beginning I thought this is a odd movie but turned out a really good movie.A part 2 would be good I reckon.|, This story is a gem... If you're blessed enough to have grown up in the Eire Country or have grown like myself with a grandma who left Ireland to America in 1909 to the US. 
To ever hear the legends & lore of a time well forgotten, this story well tells. Grandma told me stories of an era not distracted by radio, tv, iPad or cell phones. When she told a story... you listened with baited breath and knew the stories to be true. I've heard her tales of faire folk that are not delightful winged creatures but malevolent creatures determined to lure the weak minded to demise, ghosts that came back to exact revenge or justice. Phantoms that wanted to be recognized so they could move on or tortured souls that demanded retribution. Leprechauns were not playful icons of US St. Patty's Day but incarnate demons and never so playful as a pot of gold. This movie sets all the haunting tales of grandma's best bedtime stories of beware, never trust and nobody comes baring gifts without the evil of a catch. Enjoy this one as much as I have. Many thanks to Movie Central for the share... and in the spirit of Halloween, beware and never doubt the other side!|, Thanks MC. I really enjoyed this one. Contrary to what some others have said, I had no problem seeing what was on the screen. I thought the cinematography was beautifully done. It captured the darkness of the curse that controlled Rachel and Edward’s dreary existence and inevitable future, while using light sparingly to portray Rachel’s hope of escaping from it.|, Every once in a while, a gem shows up. This is one of those gems.|, This is an underrated film.  Its eerie, suspenseful, creepy, and sad.  The acting is great and fits the timeline.  It -is- fiction, a horror story, but much deeper.
Some people don't like the ending but i think it makes perfect sense.  It's the only way they could end the film.|, Very enthralling!!! Unlike anything I have ever seen before...Sort of gave me that gothic feeling like ""The Others""...I really enjoyed it. Ole girl sure didn't mind just walking away... She was pretty cold on that note... Thank you so much!!!  Happy Halloween!!!"

It's absolutely brilliant and would recommend this. The twists in this film was perfectly made and I was really impressed. 10/10.|, It was a good movie wasn't the best but it was good the ending was definitely not what I expected. The thing I really liked about it was the fact that it didn't feel rushed. They took their time took you through the story as they should.

The older couple stole my heart! Great acting from Ruth and Ira |, This movie is so beautiful, loved the entire story. Too bad not everybody knows how to appreciate a good movie.|, I read the book after watching the movie and I must say that both are equally amazing. I loved that the movie had a bond between Sophia and Ira. While the book showed the relationship more of Ira and Ruth. Beautifully written and told thumbs up from me.|, I find this film touching, the story of ruth and ira is magnificent !and the similarity of their characters in the present relationship of luke and sophia is very well transcribed..a single word I loved!|, Okay, I watched the trailer and i was like ""well...

The Lords of Salem,Lords of Salem Official Trailer #2 (2013) - Rob Zombie Movie HD,Y606RoSur8o,3430505,8746,1470,"This movie's an underrated gem. Never met anyone who likes it but its one of my favs. I like the unique characters, you just don't see movies made about these types of people and they all just feel so authentic and human. Excruciatingly simple story but its told in the most unique and emotional way possible, the cinematography is breathtaking, the autumn atmosphere is beautiful and the allegory is so simple it just works. 

I have a thing for arthouse climaxes, the ending feels almost like a Czech new wave homage and the demons or whatever they are look straight out of a 70s Doctor Who episode. I LOVE this movie, couldn't recommend it enough - but it does appear i'm in the minority on this one.|, I loved this movie.   Its not for the kids today.  Its for us people who loved the horror movies of the 60's and 70's.  Something you cannot explain you can only feel.  No gore just fright.  Kinda like when you have a nightmare that is terrifying until you wake up and say why the hell was I scared of that.|, This is like Rob Zombie's loveletter to 1970's horror movies. He even has the film grain and texture just right. It's a very artsy fartsy film with a story so light it's barely a movie, but I gotta say the cinematography and the way it's delivered is solid. I just wish the story had something more going on and not just shock for the sake of shock.|, This film was really different. I can completely understand why people can dislike it but I can understand why people will love it. It's not your typical horror film. I loved the imagery. It was truly beautiful in the ugly sorta way, it felt like an older 70s horror movie. The sets and camera angles also felt like the early German expression films where everything was shot at an odd angle and had a very dreamlike atmosphere which set the mood. Unfortunately this film is pretty heavy on atmosphere and visuals but not very much on story which may bother some people. At some points there are just things flashing at the screen which is cool to look at but really doesn't do much for the story. It feels like a crazy weird acid trip (which I'm sure that's what Rob Zombie was going for). Don't go into this movie expecting another ghost story like Sinister or The Conjuring. Go into this movie and expect to see weird visuals about witches and Satan. You have to be in the right sort of mood for this movie and when you're in it, it's pretty dang cool.|, I love this movie. It's so different from his previous films. unlike House of 1000 corpses or Devils rejects, the Chaos in this is more subtle and unnerving. There are bits that really gave me chills. |, I'm going to watch this tonight. I don't care what some people say about it. I love Zombie and LOVE the cast he has in this. I'm old school ( but NOT old) and love these types of flicks. |, this film features the same deliberate pacing that can be found in many of the great horror films of the 70s like halloween, or the omen. and that's not such a bad thing really, rob zombie really knows how to generate a slow burn of suspense with imagery and music and make it believable. that's masterful of you ask me. i really loved this movie.|, This film has become my favorite by Rob Zombie. Putting in Bruce Davidson was great. His best role was in Williard-1971 It definitely to me  seems like a lot of elements of 1970's horror. Taken from films like The Sentinel(Beverly D""Angelo is completely silent in this film) , color much like Suspiria and Inferno it has that feel to it. The visuals are interesting. I must say Sheri Moon Zombie's bedroom is not on atmospheric I love the use of early 1900's images on the walls I believe they are from the film A Trip To The Moon-1902. Of course the song Lords of Salem that John 5 created his style reminds of Christopher Young's work on Hellraiser and Sinister soundtracks.|, I personally think Zombie is a great horror film maker. I love his movies. They have a dark, satanic, and creepy vibe to them unlike a lot of horror movies made nowadays. Love this film and can't wait for his next one.|, If you’re a fan of a this movie, check out the novel. It’s a completely new experience. Almost like reading the director’s cut of the film, highly recommend it"

Such a great actress!|, Just finished watching the movie. I am so pleasantly surprised! It's actually really funny and keeps you entertained from start to finish. I loved it 😄|, Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actress of all time. Love how versatile and talented she is. From Comedy to Drama like it’s another day at the office.|, This movie is simply entertaining and fun to watch, no extra unnecessary plots added which is perfect. Love it.|, The way she said ""my friend and her cover model are going to die"" is so welcoming and hilarious at the same time|, Just got out of the theatre watching this.

I was genuinely surprised on how funny this movie was. I enjoyed from beginning to end… even had a moment where I laughed for a few minutes straight and it was great.

If you want to just kickback and enjoy a film, go watch this. Truly a great comedy.|, We need more movies like this. I miss dumb but fun movies like this.|, I'm not much for going to the ""theater"" anymore; but Sandra Bullock, what a gem.  The casting really made this movie so enjoyable.  Channing Tatum as the built guy with the tender voice/cover model trying to be the hero really did it for me.  I don't know if in real life he's really that nice, but he just played that part so well.  Usually guys that built are well, jerks.  Daniel Radcliffe, awesome. Brad and the hair flip, I laughed so hard.  Who knew Brad could be funny???  If Sandra produced this over the pandemic, bravo!!!  It's probably the only film I'll go to see this year, but this one was worth it.|, I watched this film and laughed so much. Great cast, storyline, plot, music, script, and ending. It was brilliant! ★★★★★|, I just came home from the movies. I thought it was a good one. I love the fact that it was a fun movie with lots of action. Sandra Bullock was great! So is the rest of the cast. The scenes, the locations, the wild jungle and waterfalls... just breathtaking!"
The Lost City of Z,The Lost City of Z International Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Trailers,wwjtdOqTmrA,7840844,26070,1497,"Truly a great film. Solid direction and fine performances throughout combined with Darius Khondjis subtly beautiful cinematography and thoughtprovoking emotional content makes this one a unique gem. Highly recommended.|, Great movie. It's a shame it didn't get the attention it deserved when released, but surely it's a movie that will become more and more appreciated as years pass by. Quality exploration/adventure movies like this are rare these days.|, For those wondering this movie was amazing, one of the best in a while|, This movie is really good. Anyone who hasn't checked it out, I highly recommend it.|, This film is incredibly great, but if you’re the kind of person who needs loud noises, exploding stuff, and obvious plot twists/jumps in order to keep yourself entertained, then this is simply not the movie for you. The ending is incredibly rewarding, and to watch the unravel of the main character as he passes through the stages of life while always keeping the city of Z in mind, it really puts you into deep thought. I couldn’t get this movie out of my mind for weeks after I saw it. Watching it again right now!|, Goosebumps. My first time seeing the trailer and finding out that there's a movie. This story always fascinated me. I put it up there with the legend of ""Agartha"" and advanced ancient technology, advanced societies around still today on/in Earth, and possibly on the moon too.|, This was a nice change of pace from the usual crap that Hollywood comes out  with. People said it was boring but if you have a wild heart for adventure and love history this movie  was great to watch! It pretty much was a good recount of the actual events. You never truly know if Fawcett did find the city or not. Maybe he did and didnt want to come back maybe he died maybe the Brits didnt like the idea of a civilization that was older and well functional or not as savage as they made them out to be. Enjoyed watching this|, this movie is truly a masterpiece ... great story, great plots                (SPOILER ALERT)                 too bad it got a sad end|, Truly an amazing movie!!

great story line, super badass action, ending was great and unexpected.|, I didn't have high expectations about this movie.  It seems that westerns these days aren't very good for the most part compared to the classics from the 60's and 70's...especially when it's a remake like this one.  I am *so glad* gave this a shot.  It is hands down one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.  As a huge fan of westerns overall, I would honestly say this one ranks up there with some of the best....and dare I say, better than the original!  Well done!!!|, This movie was great. Not having seen the original I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was that there was a larger than life bad guy and 7 dudes that stepped up to take him on. It was action packed, gritty, comedic, and in some cases suspenseful. Granted, in some situations there was predictability, but that didn't take away from the plot line at all. Very entertaining movie. Great cast. Funny dialogue amongst the 7 cowboys. Fitting ending. Would recommend to any action film fans.|, Often when there is a remake and you are a fan of the original, one cringes at how bad the movie might be.  In this case, however, the movie matches and even surpasses the original and keeps you glued to your seat until the very end.  the score is so fantastic that when the credits roll you still can't leave your seat.  Truly MAGNIFICENT   :   )|, A great story line, unique character persona's, excellent cinematography with impressive sound so that you can feel the bullets. It's like the westerns I grew up with only in colour and sound quality that all good westerns deserve. In my humble opinion, this ranks way up there with Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. My 12yo son loved it and is now able to understand why I loved Westerns as a kid. I don't care that there is an original version and yes I remember it and love it. I do not compare to be fair, We just enjoyed it.|, What I liked more in this movie, is the facial features of these heroes and the speed in making the right decision|, I just watched this magnificent movie about these seven badass heroes. A classic western story but what I liked the most was the story about the traumatic syndromes all of them in one way or another were suffering from. Its not easy being a gunfighter, a healthy part of you´ll die if you kill another person - the nightmares will hunt you very night. The only way to keep on going is not to lay down, you´ll have to keep on fighting for something - otherwise you´ll loose focus. Even if you are magnificent - its hard to bee a hero - its no picknick to be badass...|, This is one of my favorite movies, one of the best wild west films ever  my rating 10/10"

It does seem criminally underrated, it’s such a good perspective of the author and his life that inspired the story we all know and love to read, watch or tell at Christmas time|, I LOVE THIS! Can't wait to see it! It doesn't matter if it's how he ""really"" wrote ""A Christmas Carol"". What matters is that it is a delightful way to show how it ""might have happened"". And I say, ""God Bless us, everyone!""|, I just came from seeing an early screening of this film, it was awesome, it puts you into such a Christmas spirit!! Christopher Plummer steals the show and Dan Stevens is great, he brings such a depth to Charles Dickens, what a talented man who overcame so many obstacles. Dickens truly had a wonderful imagination and the world is better because of it, I loved this film, highly recommended.|, At first I thought this was going to be a boring movie, but I was mistaken. It was absolutely great!!|, Omg..just saw it for the first time..a very brilliant masterpiece..the tension of his struggle with his shadow side..straight out of Carl  Jung´s description of this shadow personality we carry as a burden..best movie I ´ve seen since a long time..my sincere  compliments to you 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️🎄❤️‍🔥|, I watched it just today, and was like how did I not come across it for past one year. I could totally relate to Charles D shown in this movie. I wish more such Christmas movies are made|, Wonderfully formulaic and magnificently fleshed-out. There is _just_ enough of A Christmas Carol in its raw form for me to embrace it fully as a Christmas movie. I personally deem it a modern classic. Everyone is wonderful in this movie and Christopher Plummer is delightful as Ebenezer Scrooge. Fantastic movie.|, So glad that Charles is continuing this magical classic story into one of the greatest Christmas movie franchises of all time|, It reminds me when I write poems. the same thing happen to me, and it just likes a travel to another world. No one can see what I see. I feel the movie so deep and I love it. It's so cleaver from the author.

Finally a movie that does not attack Russia.|, Everything about this movie is awesome. I have no complain at all. The cast, the music, the cinematography, the humor, the story, and Henry Cavill. It's a perfection. 10/10 for me.
It's criminally underrated.|, It's a comedy/suspense/thriller with a touch of romance. Written for adults who appreciate witty banter and filmed for people who like style, design and color. The actors were excellent in their roles and showed great comic timing. The story is mostly predictable even though there are quite a few surprises and at least four great scenes. There could have been more romance, especially with Alicia Vikander stealing the scenes, but maybe that would have been too sentimental. I can't wait to buy the Blu-Ray!

The accuracy, realism, sound and visual effects and drama were just phenomenal. Absolute masterpiece.|, ""Help is only 140 million miles away"" that's one hell of a tag line, really hits you in the chest|, This is by far the best Sci-fi space film that i watch in 2010s. Matt Damon's incredible performance, the striking visual imagery and the whole story behind it. I pretty much give this movie an A+. I already had this film in my Blu-Ray DVD. Thanks Mr. Damon for giving a great performance in this and also for Ridley Scott for masterfully directed this. 👍👍👍👍|, This film is so good! And it is actually hilarious at times which the trailer does not do justice to. Absolutely loved it on so many levels. Danny Glover has this wicked small part that he absolutely was perfect for!!|, tbh, the part where he was about to leave mars and realizes he made it that far made me cry like a lil boy. such powerful acting|, So good of the cameraman to stay and document this.|, So looking forward to this. I won't take the ""Scott Free"" logo at the start as anything personal :)|, Loved this movie. The humor along with the situations that cause your hair to stand up on the back of your neck all come together perfectly.|, This was perhaps one of the best movies made in the last 10 years. Especially considering it stayed surprisingly close to the book it's based on, a rarity these days. Should have won the Oscar that year|, For me this is easily one of the best films ever made.
I watch it regularly and never tire of it
Remember watching in the cinema and was looking forward to seeing it again before the film was even finished.

The shot from off the bow of the boat while the music plays is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.|, This may not be one of my favorite films but it definitely is one of the most exquisitely filmed and magnificently acted movies ever made. It sticks with you.|, Whilst I agree that Phoenix is INSANE in this film - I think Philip Seymour Hoffman really stole the show for me. His performance was so layered, the intensity behind the charisma was just captivating and so enthralling to see. This entire film is a masterpiece.|, This film is one that has stayed in my mind for years. It was magnificent, how it didn't get more notoriety is beyond me.|, The screenplay and the cinematography of this movie is really something. After I read a few negative reviews and a lot of people hating on this, I re-watched it twice and if anything I just like it even more now.

I am a 30 year chef and to be perfectly honest...  not gonna say many kitchen & industry people wouldn't smile and nod at many points through this film. As well, everything was so well done. Fresh new story, great social commentary, wildly accurate portrayal of how our craft has been compromised by social media, critics, and people just calling themselves 'foodies' without any actually knowledge of what we put in to and sacrifice for our craft. This is by far one of the best movies I've seen this year. Perfect blend of comedy, thriller, dialogue, and stellar acting. Really cannot say enough. I'll leave it with... the trailer doesn't do the movie justice and you think you know what this movie will be.... until you don't.|, This might be the most intense season of Hell's Kitchen yet.|, The film is literally AMAZING. Not even a single minute of boredom. So unique and difficult to describe clearly it's genre. But for sure what's going on in this story will captivate you! Highly recommended.|, Visually the film is beautiful and the acting is wonderful.
Anya was perfection in it. I loved how her character developed and how she managed to manipulate her way through the film.
It is very difficult to pull off a movie that is consistently thrilling all while being a brilliant dark comedy and The Menu is just that.|, Everything becomes a thriller when Anya-Taylor Joy in it|, This is exactly the kind of film I love. It’s darkly hilarious, focused and immaculately executed. Nicholas Hoult delivers a masterclass performance. One of my favourite actors. Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor Joy are also electrifying. A true gem|, I used to work in restaurants and this movie gets so much right about them, down to the *taptaptap* of the foodie telling someone they need to take a photo first.|, Just saw this - I know this trailer is ridiculous, but it's an amazing movie. So entertaining, original, unique, hilarious, frightening, and thought-provoking all at the same time. The performances are excellent, the writing is terrific, and there truly is no other movie that is quite like it. It's probably my favorite movie of 2022 (up there with ""X"") and I think virtually anyone would get at least some fun out of it.|, Just watched this movie, its incredible! I mean, they have chosen one location which is usually not ideal for feature films, but it was perfect and the pace is beautiful .. you will be entertained the whole 2 hours. Its very experimental, so not a typical story type that you would usually expect, but def worth watching. The cinematography, editing, the details and characters were just stunningly amazing.|, I loved this movie. I still feel melancholic, some kind of pain, the pain of disapproval from people that never knew what you been through to get there, all the effort. Well made movie, from story to cinematography, actors and the balance of different emotions. It gets into you, we have to appreciate, respect and enjoy."

It shows that how nature and basic human instincts can shift the emotion of even an engaged and married person to another person in just a week . And it demonstrates that love can just happen between any stranger if we put them in a physical and emotional bounds .|, Amazing movie! Very, very good acting. Also love how realistic the relationship between them was. Lots of high stress and arguing due to the situation, two clashing personalities learning to work together. 

Also really liked the behind the scenes and how everyone involved worked so hard to make it so real by filming in real environments. Amazing work!|, This is a very touching movie. For the first time In a long time I wasn't disappointed with the ending of the movie. The emotional level of this movie was very genuine. I enjoyed every minute. Thank You for bringing these two stars together.

Winslet is always brilliant and always taking interesting risks, Elba is quickly becoming very popular for good reason, he's fantastic.  This looks like a very good pairing of actors, and even though this trailer is only so so, I can tell that the actual film is going to be very good.  Plus BEAU BRIDGES is the pilot!

The world will literally shake when Clint Eastwood passes on. He is still such a great actor for being 88 freakin years old! I give it two 👍👍|, The trailer alone shows clearly how touching and heartfelt this film truly is and should get the Academy Award for Best Picture.|, Man, i feel so sad seeing this man getting older with every movie.|, Clints not just an actor, he's a true legend and an inspiration to us all.

The characters he portrays in his movies resonate with us because we all know someone who's similar to them, be it our fathers, grandfathers, brothers, uncles etc.

Treasure him, you know for a fact there'll never be another actor of his calibre or gravitas ever.

And thats a fact, one of the genuine icons of the movie industry, still around showing the youngsters how to do things properly.|, No one can replace Clint Eastwood.

Literally NOTHING in the first broken trailer worked except for the little bits of music here and there. The screams only worked with the intensity of the sound design around it. Isolated, it's just plain silly and comedic.|, There's a reason the mummy was good the first time. It had funny dialogue, character development, was kinda creepy at some moments, and it had a cute romantic dynamic. It was borderline cheesy and intelligent. I mean, sometimes the small moments in a movie is what makes you want to watch it over and over again. I don't see this version having any memorable qualities.|, To be honest, this is one of those movies in which I was rooting for the villain to win. I really wanted the mummy to complete her ritual, transform Tom Cruise into an Egyptian god and that he had succumbed to her offer... The movie would have been a hundred times more interesting that way...|, I've never heard such an epic scream like that. Only Tom can do that, what a freaking legend.|, 6 years later and I still wish the Dark Universe could have succeeded|, Can we all agree Tom Cruises scream is hillarious|, I watched this movie it was AMAZING!!! Hilarious at many parts and the rest kept me on the edge of my seat.

After reading some of the comments I can say I'm not alone and that others have cried as well. They saved each other and will miss each other. Beautiful and heart felt story.

Loved every minute of it!|, I saw it just yesterday. It's not only visually stunning. It's truly an experience. 

Finally, Refn managed to merge his crafty direction with a layered and worthy story, he now has something to tell. A deep look at the dark core of what makes us human and to our beauty obsessed society. 

People complain about the lack of character development, but the movie instead of forcing the characters to deliver, it's just faithful to them. People in the fashion business are portrayed just the way they are, empty. Souless. Merciless. Savages. 

And the richest story is not in the words, because just like in a world where everything that matters it's is looks, the movie tells a story that way, with images and visuals. 

It's perfect. I can't wait for NWR next project. 

Ps. On a side note, Elle it's incredible. So I enjoyed to see Keanu on that kind of role, hope to see more of him experimenting.|, Truly one of the most disturbing movies I ever seen. I gasped at some of the scenes. Jena Malones scene will be talked about for years to come .|, i just watched this and i’m so confused how this movie had bad reviews IT’S A MASTERPIECE!!!!! a lot of jaw dropping moments with beautiful cinematography|, This is one of those movies that's underappreciated and misunderstood when it first comes out, but will pop back up in 10 years, to be considered a cult classic. Like Jennifer's Body.|, The real horror is having to clean up all that glitter|, I just saw this movie yesterday on a whim and was blown away. It's crazy how many negative reviews this got. I started it with no expectations and finished it realizing I had just watched a MASTERPIECE. Jaw-dropping visuals and soundtrack that makes every other movie look dull in comparison, the lack of dialogue is done purposefully as the visuals and the actor's expressions and body language do most of the talking. Multiple layers of meaning and symbolism throughout. This movie is a work of art, and anyone who thinks it's bad simply doesn't understand what they are watching.|, Saw it on Friday and I feel like I've been hypnotized. Visually stunning with a soundtrack to match and some disturbing scenes to top it off. I can't wait to see it again|, Such a great and brutally  honest film. The witches were real scary(in a real life kind of way), also the first light show in that creepy club was super dope."
The Nest,The Nest - Official Trailer I HD I IFC Films,svq5OzzT7s4,547867,1529,218,"Even tho this movie is receiving a lot of criticism, it shows how little people live in situations like this. It managed to show my whole family situation like a book, my parents working a risky job where we are either completely broke without enough for groceries, or momentarily thriving with money. The unstable relationship with money ruined everyones view about each other. I found myself relating to Ben the most, being the younger sibling seeing your whole family in chaos leaves a permanent scar on you. Rory truly and utterly reminded me of my father and the horrible gambler he is when it comes to money. Sam is a rebellious teen the same way my sister was, leaving me all alone all day long. Alice just being stuck in between, hiding money from her husband with the constant fights and arguing hit too close to home. Would never wish for someone to go through this no matter what.|, Jude Law knocks that role out of the park. A super film that depicts English obsession with class and status very well. Not sure if it will resonate with the American audience but I genuinely know someone in London who is basically a real life version of Jude Law's character - even some phrases he says in the movie are identical . It hasn't changed much over the years.|, I really liked this movie, what a great character study. Netflix called it a psychological thriller lol no, it is family drama. The two leads were great and the writing was wonderful and refreshing...we are all used to terrible writing these days. All the characters are flushed out and you care about them and sympathize with them and relate to them. Would highly recommend!|, Honestly, trailers for arthouse films should be a scene snippet rather than a bunch of scenes/dialogues mashed together.

This movie was phenomenal.|, Μόλις έχασα και εγώ μιάμιση ώρα από τη ζωή μου βλέποντας αυτή την ταινία. Με ξεγέλασαν οι ηθοποιοί και δεν είδαμε καν τον λοκώ της πρωταγωνίστριας.|, This is a good movie. It depicts the dysfunctional lifestyle of a grandiose narcissist (Rory) - talks big, lives in fantasy and delusional. Manages to manipulate others. Coerced the wife to relocate, no care for the impact of his wild fantasy on others, always looking for ways to exploit others, lives way beyond means. 

The wife who feels exhausted and lonely but tried to keep it together till she couldn't. 

Then the children who felt lost and disconnected with so much instability. They've moved 10 times🤦🏽‍♀️
The visit to his Mum subtly exposes the childhood trauma he experienced from his dad. Pay attention to Rory's reply when his Mum said 'Bless him' about his dad.

These types of narcissist are not necessarily physically abusive, they're delusional and keep you in the loop till you lose a sight of yourself. 
Brilliant movie. Great acting. I like that the ending leaves you to draw your own conclusions.|, The daughter's music transitioned from synth pop to post punk as the family turmoil ramped up. Why Rory was not making the trades he had a talent for while waiting for a big payout from an unlikely buy-out of his employer is unclear, but I noticed an implication of laziness while he was living in the US. His wife sure took pleasure dropping turds in the punch bowl at every business get-together.|, For anyone wondering - this movie is made about the drama in a family but it is shot with the sort of camera angles and music that seem like horror movie tropes. 
It’s not a horror film but it is made to look like that|, Looks so good!!! Alexis Allen Winter killed it with casting! :D|, that was disgusting how he excluded the girl Samantha from his family during the introduction of the family to his mother. he was denying his stepdaughter all the times.. but at the end, the girl was the first one who accepted him again"
The New Mutants,The New Mutants | Official Trailer | 20th Century FOX,W_vJhUAOFpI,15547545,220354,15841,"The best part of the movie was literally the last 30 seconds of it when she said ""my father used to tell me that inside every person, there are 2 bears. One bear is all things good. Compassion, love, trust. The other is all things evil. Fear, shame and self destruction. I asked him. Which one wins? He answered. The one you feed.""|, I just got back from seeing this movie, after waiting 3 years. I enjoyed it. The script wasn't perfect, but the acting was phenomenal. Especially Blu Hunt. I hope to see her acting career continue for many years to come.
I feel a little bad that Josh Boone won't get to finish his trilogy, but I think the movie works just fine as a standalone movie.|, This film had a lot of potential, wished they could’ve made this into a series. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the characters, just wished we could’ve seen more of them.|, This looks more like a horror movie than a marvel movie.|, This movie was great and should've been a mini series. I mean the potential and the cast is incredible. I found the ending disappointing, but if they had more time, it would have been built up properly.|, Idk why but every movie Charlie Heaton is in would be better as a whole series than a movie. This would have worked so much better if they had got more time to build everything up and develop the plot slowly. I recommend it because the performances are great, especially Anya, Massie and Charlie|, The de-aging technology here is impressive, the entire cast looks a few years younger.|, I believe that this movie is going to do better than expected (even with all the delays).  This seems like it is definitely bringing a new element to Marvel movies in general.|, I just rewatched all the X-Men movies before finally watching this one, cause I hadn't seen it yet. And I genuinely think that New Mutants is one of the most interesting movies in the X-Men franchise. The acting was amazing, I felt like I got all the characters and their backstory, trauma and fears. I found it super interesting that everything is set in a single place. I'm still puzzled why the reviews are so bad, I really enjoyed this movie!|, Idk why this movie gets the shade that it does. I LOVED IT. It's right up there with Deadpool as far as quality Marvel mutant Fox movies. Ilyana Rasputin was a complete badass, and the love story between Dani and Rahne was a really nice touch."

Everything from the cast to the damn plot twists was top notch. I highly recommend it. Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe make a perfect movie duo.|, The best Ryan Gosling movie to date. This guy is freaking hilarious. He should definitely do more comedy.|, What I don’t remotely understand is why there wasn’t a sequel to this film?? Seriously, Gosling and Crowe were hilarious together! This movie was so well done. Great story, good cast, cool locations, epic vibe, and incredibly funny. They need to do a sequel!!|, Just saw it last night. I can safely say that it absolutely delivers. It's without a doubt one of the better films so far this year.|, Such a good underrated movie. Highly recommend watching it.|, This was such a nice movie to watch. When you tired of watching so much crap and you stumble upon a legit funny and fun movie, really makes my day.|, Ryan Gosling is absolutely phenomenal in this hilarious movie.|, i couldn't stop laughing from beginning to end. everything about it was flawless!

russell + ryan + the other members - esp the coffee scene.. my laugh was echoing throughout the building for the entirety lmao I FUCKING LOVE THIS MOVIE NOTHING CAN TAINT IT TOP NOTCH ABSOLUTE FAVORITE AND I WILL NEVER STOP WATCHING IT AHHHHHH how fucking perfect can it be? WHY WAS IT SO FUNNY? I WASN'T FUCKING READY AHHHHHHHH now i'm a diehard fan and can't stop watching press material lmao also yay bruins <3 ty shane|, This is probably my favorite movie and I only heard about it cause it was mentioned in a 10 second fandango add at the theaters.

Smile because he was born|, Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day, my father, he told me, ""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
""When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""
He said, ""One day, you'll leave this world behind

My father told me|, Amazing|, This song hits different knowing he’s gone. Never forgotten. He accomplished his goal! Live his best life.|, A Tribute to Avicii.   

Avicii, whose real name was Tim Bergling, was an iconic figure in the world of electronic dance music. His contributions to the music industry left an indelible mark that continues to resonate with fans around the world. 

Avicii's talent as a DJ and producer was truly exceptional. He possessed a unique ability to blend different genres and create infectious, uplifting melodies that brought people together on the dance floor. Tracks like ""Levels,"" ""Wake Me Up,"" and ""Hey Brother"" are just a few examples of his chart-topping hits that became anthems of a generation.

What made Avicii even more remarkable was his commitment to pushing the boundaries of EDM. He was a pioneer in fusing folk, country, and pop elements into his electronic tracks, defying traditional genre boundaries and capturing the hearts of a diverse audience. His music was not just for the clubs; it was for anyone seeking a connection to something greater.

Beyond his musical prowess, Avicii's story serves as a poignant reminder of the pressures and challenges faced by artists in the industry. He openly struggled with the demands of fame and the toll it took on his mental and physical health. His tragic passing in 2018 was a devastating loss to the music world and a stark reminder of the importance of mental health awareness.

In addition to his musical legacy, Avicii's philanthropic efforts have left a lasting impact. He used his success to give back, creating the Tim Bergling Foundation to focus on mental health and suicide prevention, a cause close to his heart.

Avicii's music will forever be a source of inspiration, a testament to his artistic genius and innovation. He may have left this world far too soon, but his legacy continues to shine brightly through his music, the memories he created, and the positive change he sought to bring about in the world. Avicii will always be remembered not only for his incredible talent but also for his profound influence on the EDM genre and his unwavering commitment to making the world a better place.|, Cada cierto tiempo hago catarsis muy profundas y hermosas con esta canción, son las palabras que mi mejor amigo me dice en representación de mi papá, un día estábamos en el castillo de Chambord en Francia comiendo un paté de cordero y una limonada artesanal y palabras más o menos tuvimos una conversación muy profunda que va de la mano con esta canción por eso la amo tanto.❤|, Is it just me or does this song give you chills in your spine because how energetic and posotive, and how it touches your heart!?"
The Night Before,THE NIGHT BEFORE - Official Trailer (HD),kOBdxkhJvHQ,15639022,8489,580,"This movie deserves more credit.  I remember seeing it in theatres.  I was laughing so hard and had to hold in my laugh at times.  Gonna watch it again now after 6 years|, just watched this movie today with no expectation. it was hilarious! haven't laughed so hard watching a movie in a long time lol worth watching!|, I love this movie! Stumbled upon this gem several years ago and now it’s part of our Christmas movie tradition.|, I was not expecting that at all! I laughed so hard, almost cried. Thought I'd pee my pants|, I can't believe it took me so long to watch this film ....it was sooooo funny 🤣💯|, Anthony Mackie always seems to be the third wheel of a friendship. 
Between Cap & Bucky, Mark & The Rock, and now Seth & Levitt.|, 2023 still rocking this Christmas classic a must watch.|, cant wait to see this|, cant wait to see it :)|, I laughed out loud at the almost The Interview"
The Night House,THE NIGHT HOUSE | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures,2Tshycci2ZA,7256486,23629,1242,"Such a beautiful film. Very thought-provoking. The boat scene almost had me in tears. I don't suffer from depression, but I know people who do and I've known some people that let it consume them to the point they ended it all. The themes in this film are similar to The Babadook but I feel like the delivery in this film is superior in every way. Definitely a must see!|, For those wondering, this is directed by David Bruckner, the guy who directed The Ritual as well as shorts in V/H/S, Southbound, and The Signal.  The guy is a genius, and I can’t wait to see this one!|, Honestly this is such a good suspense/thriller/horror film! Definitely left me thinking. Rebecca Hall's performance was outstanding ☺️|, Just saw this and it’s absolutely great. If you’re a fan of horror movies/thrillers this movie is absolutely worth watching. I found a lot of the scares to be really creative and different than other movies in recent years. Awesome movie.|, This is a trailer that actually entices you to see the movie by leaving you with more questions than plot points. Freaky and well-done! This is how you do a movie trailer! Psyched to see this!|, People saying this movie was boring didnt pay attention to the details. This is actually a good movie. Less horror, more on psych thriller. Got teary-eyed when the reveal happened. Props to Beth's bestfriend.|, The best movie I’ve seen in ages. Depth and meaning and tons of atmosphere. Scratched my mystery itch, horror itch and thriller itch.|, Rebecca Hall is an underrated actress. I would like to see more of her. She deserves more shine!|, Honestly, one of the best and creepiest horror films I have ever seen! Loved it!|, Just watched this today! Such an amazing film. Absolutely loved it! Don’t go in expecting a jumpscare-y horror film. It’s more of a psychological thriller film with horror elements. A slow burn masterpiece!"
The Nightingale,The Nightingale - Official Trailer I HD I IFC Films,YuP8g_GQIgI,2763560,12245,1662,"Despite how challenging this film is, I actually found it ultimately up-lifting and cathartic. It is not just a revenge tale; it is about taking back one's humanity and dignity after it has been ripped away from you in the most horrific way, when the pain and rage threatens to erase what humanity you have left. About how empathy and compassion between survivors salvages humanity. About how survivors need to be stood up for, and the atrocities they endured acknowledged. About the power of openly bearing witness and confronting one's perpetrators. A meditation on justice versus vengance.|, “You don’t want trouble but sometimes trouble wants you.”

Love that line. This movie will be a classic.|, As an indigenous woman I found myself at home in this film in the worst possible way. My heart goes out to my indigenous cousins across the ditch. May you all keep your identity and endure. ""you are still here and you aren't going anywhere"".|, This is probably the most brutal movie I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Only time over ever seen someone run out of an auditorium to get away from what was happening.|, Absolutely raw and powerful film. Cathartic for anyone who's been at the short end of a power differential and hopefully, eye-opening for everyone else. Kent's skill at portraying the ""heart of darkness"" without exploiting the victims and even giving some depth and context to the perpetrators is superb.|, This movie is the best depiction of the worst of Australian history.
These are the thing's that happened to my Irish ancestor's and to the Australian indigenous people, at the hands of the British establishment.
It hurt me in a way that nothing can describe because i am an Irish Australian descendant and so it affected me more than just being a confronting, brutal movie.
It felt very deeply personal.
It made the blood in my veins boil and my spirit scream, for all the injustice and brutality imposed upon my people and the indigenous Australian people.
The dispersion of my people and the stripping of the native people and their culture.
I cried during and after watching it and it took me weeks to recover because of the way it deeply affected me and my spirit.
I will never watch it again but it is a brilliant movie, with brilliant actor's and it is highly underated.
It deserves more recognition but my advice is to watch it at your own risk because it's very explicit, brutal and confronting and one must be mentally prepared for it, especially if you have ties to the dark past of Australian history.|, I cried throughout the film, couldn't look away during it, and just sat in silence for the rest of the night. 

It was a beautifully crafted film capturing the horrific realities of injustice in colonial Australia.  The kind of film you call a masterpiece but never watch again.

I have chills just watching the trailer.|, This movie was fucking phenomenal. One of the most confronting and brutal movies I've seen but at the same time incredibly vital and essential viewing. It reckons with the human horrors of the past in a way that is both unflinching and intensely powerful. One of the best Australian films I've seen, and I'm Australian!|, Literally one of the best films I've ever seen. Extremely violent but the story is true to history and the production, casting, directing etc are beyond perfect!!!|, One of the few film experiences that have left me speechless. Absolutely MASTERFUL work. I was GLUED to the screen every second of this thing, the storytelling has a strong grasp and doesn't let go until the very end. I applaud Jennifer Kent and Aisling Franciosi for this MASTERPIECE. HOPEFULLY this gets nominated at the academy awards. INDIE MOVIES NEED LOVE TOO💯✊🏾"

The Northman,THE NORTHMAN - Official Trailer - Only In Theaters April 22,oMSdFM12hOw,29383853,239366,18078,"If you want more big budget productions like this rather than a constant barrage of comic book adaptations then please for the love of God go out and support this movie.|, Films like these feel so rare. This will be a timeless classic for me. Robert Eggers and everyone else involved gave it 100%|, This film was like breathe of fresh air. Finally something serious, made as possible historically accurate, something which actually touches you, something real. Thanks to everyone who did work on this movie, you did great
UPD. Historically accurate not in terms of storyline) I mean historical authenticity and whole respect to the fact how people did actually look and behave in that times. Ofc it's a little bit exaggerated, it's not historical movie, but still it's made with maximum respect|, I like the shot where Fjölnir raises his helmet. We know well who we would see, and yet this scene is tremendous. The whole movie is cold, dark and fresh in so many ways, and it gives some authentic viking vibes. God bless Robert Eggers, he's doing his job wonderfully.|, this movie was real cinema. No franchise attached to it, no over-saturated sequels, nothing. It was fantastic all around. Give it a chance over those comic book movies, please|, This film is a masterpiece! 
It was marketed all wrong. People thought it was just some random brutal 'dude-movie' and it's not. 
It's an important milestone in showing the old norse perspective on life in a respectful and true manner.
It is a reimagined version of the Viking tale that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Why is this not at the center of the marketing?! 
Of course it's not historically perfect, nothing is, nothing can be. But films like this are important in the face of things like The Last Kingdom or the Viking series, which twists our heritage into fantasy that seems more like Game of Thrones than anything else, all while flat out rewriting historical events and characters. The Northman is not an actual historical event, it's a story, just like the sagas of its time, a story about fate and destiny. It's true to our past culture and beliefs, which is is highly commendable.
I love the way the fantastical/magical elements of The Northman are left to be questioned, as something that occurs only in the mind. 
And the music ...wow! What a film!|, I loved how unconventional this movie was. The story writer and directors did  not give a single shit about making the characters relatable to the 21st century American audience. They just conducted it like the people back then living in the moment.|, If Alexander Skarsgard does not get the recognition he deserves with this film, I seriously don’t know what else will. He was just… just amazing. The rest of the cast did a fantastic job as well. Felt quite lost at the beginning by not being familiarized with Norse mythology but still enjoyed it well throughout. It was witnessing theater work coming alive on screen.|, I went to the cinema with really low expectations. Never in a million years would I expect something like this. The movie was really good. Big respect to the creators|, They did a really good job making this movie. I was really impressed with the story and how they put it all together. Eyes were stuck to the screen the whole time watching it. Going to check out more movies from Robert Eggers as ""The Lighthouse"" was made in the same type of way and it was really good too."

I'm glad to see Isabelle Fuhrman get to shine in a lead role, she's a talent for sure.|, Really wish Isabelle Furman gets some noms for this. I know she already won a few best actress awards at festivals, but she's absolutely INSANELY great in this, and part of the reason why it's so intense. The final shot of her still haunts me and I watched it about a week ago. If you loved WHIPLASH or BLACK SWAN then you'll love this. Never thought a film about row crew could be so fucking insanely stressful and disturbing. i just wanted to give her a klonopin the whole time. Also, she was great in Orphan too, one of the best child performances, and then kind of was never given another juicy role until now, I hope she finally breaks out because of this and gets more lead roles. She's a phenomenal actress.|, Isabelle deserves an Oscar for this movie|, If Isabelle doesn’t get an Oscar for this there is no justice in the world. An absolutely breathtaking performance, one of my favorites from 2021|, If only I had seen this before I watched it at Tribeca at Home. Omg this movie was an emotional roller coaster.

This is the best film I’ve ever seen in my life. This film cured my depression and my cancer at the same time. It also enlightened me to the point where it elevated my soul to ecstasy. If only everyone can see this film, they will never get sick, and will gain immortality. And finally, I am in NO WAY getting paid by IFC Films for posting this totally genuine review!  Promise!!!|, This is a scarily accurate description of what rowing is like, at least the way they capture obsession. I can relate. I ruined my hip over the sport. I can't wait to see it. I've been waiting two years to see it. 

The scene where she's screaming inside a out door toilet, i actually watched them film at Brock University Invitationals. And they asked to use a few of my teammates in a few shots."

It was short sweet and not over complicated. It especially hit home because I can relate to the main character and her loss.

I was especially pleased with the visuals. 4 out of 5 stars and I would watch it again at Christmas!|, I swear to god, Mackenzie Foy is Underrated in every way. I mean, she was Bella and Edwards child, she directed The Little Prince, now she’s starring in a movie. She deserves to be recognized much more.|, I seriously loved this movie! This was the first nutcracker movie I watched, I don't understand why people think this is overrated or boring, it's great in my opinion!|, Pls dont tell me im the only one, who thinks this Movie gave me Alice in wonderland Vibes|, The music, the design, the details ,everything just fits perfectly with this amazing fantasy movie 😊😄|, Three years later and I’ve just watched it. Definitely worth every minute. 💜|, This movie had such a good unexpected twist!!! Loved it all the way!! So much effort went into this, from the cast till the costumes and set designers! You all truly impressed me again! 🐀🎪🌺❄️|, What I am really excited for with this film, is the epic renditions of Pyotr Tchaikovsky's music. Who's with me?|, That movie looks amazing! I will definitely go and see it once I have the chance. I love the Nutcracker ballet too and the music is very beautiful, so I felt nostalgic when I heard it.|, We always watch this around Christmas- I actually think it’s a great rekindling of childhood magic ❤️🥰"
The Old Man & the Gun,THE OLD MAN &amp; THE GUN | Official Trailer [HD] | FOX Searchlight,d7rlUe-Thvk,5120279,10504,718,"A completely acceptable film that doesn't have any frills. Neither predictable nor groundbreaking. A story for it's own sake. It's very Redford. It left me feeling that all the romance has been sucked out of life. What is there left for adventurous men but to give a middle finger to the system? Even doing what you love doesn't make you happy anymore. You know this is his message, and you know it's true.|, Such a wonderful movie. Redford is amazing as usual and David Lowery's wholesome filmmaking is what tops it off. Had a big smile on my face at the end.|, Wow, this film literally looks like it comes from the 70s, both the look and the style, amazing!!|, Low key, restrained, understated... something Hollywood doesn't normally do. Robert Redford was ideal for the part and the on screen chemistry between all the characters really starts and finishes with him.|, This looks terrific. I love David Lowery's work, & it's so great to see Robert Redford & Sissy Spacek together.|, Very good movie!  The movie moves slower than others but only if you’re not paying attention! Very well written and executed by talented actors who play their roles to a tee. Excellent chemistry and cinematography. A five-star recommend!|, Fantastic film. One of the few movies where it actually feels like it came right out of the 70s/80s.|, Such a great send off for Redford. I loved seeing it in theaters. Bonus: it was a discount theater, saw it for $3!!! Truly a 1970s experience|, What an honor to get the chance to play Robert Redford's leading lady! I admire the man and the entire cast is  fantastic!|, If this is Robert Redford's last film he is going out in style."

We weren't allowed to go and see him or anything during his last couple of months alive. I remember this song from a mix tape he made us when I was about 6 and that 'here I am' always resonates with me. As a youngster I imagined it was him saying it and it's even more powerful now. Sorry, I don't usually comment stuff like this on Youtube, but tonight is just one of those nights|, One of the greatest songs ever written. Difficult to believe that these guys are 80. Genius, pure and simple|, A near and dear high school friend and I used to argue about what was the better Simon & Garfunkel song, this song or The Boxer. I used to say this song mainly out of spite, but also because I loved this song. Years later, my friend has passed on and I'm stuck here not even livin' just existing. I wish I could go back in time. Words cant describe how valuable my friend Josh was to me. Now a days I just sit back and realize how great both songs are. Cheers. :-)|, Great song love it 😍|, This song is a sudden time warp… sitting upstairs doing my homework, sounds of dinner being made, my dad’s deeper voice, everything is sort of a fuzzy yellow or orange color… warm.

Wonder if it's one of those fascinating single-location, stage-like films?|, This is...this is very odd yet absurdly fascinating all at the same time. Never have I watched anything remotely similar to this. What makes it even more unexpected is that Dylan O'Brien is also in this. And Zoey Deutch as well? With Mark Rylance? This is one hell of a brilliant cast.|, This movie is so underrated after seeing it. Takes place in 1 room and has 2 major plot twists that you won't see coming and to pay attention to every detail of what is said and what actions are taken. It's as precise as the cuts he makes.|, Today was a good day for trailers. This looks so so good, as expected! Can't wait to see Dylan O'Brien and Mark Rylance together 🤩|, Dylan as an old school gangster is not something I knew I needed but I'm glad it happened 😍|, I just now watched it as it was recommended to me on Netflix. 

I absolutely loved it. What an amazing write up it is. Suspense, thrill, cliff hanger and keeps one hooked. 
Must watch !!!|, Can't wait to see Johnny Flynn as the bad guy. So great Dylan is in so many things now he deserves good things.
Although, I feel they should have hidden whatever connection Zoey and Dylan's characters have in the trailer, because the impact would have been greater within the film.|, Zoey Deutch and Dylan O’Brien are my favorite actors. Anything with them both, I’m sure will blow my mind!"

In my opinion,they are one of my biggest guilty pleasures. This one however is probably my favorite because it feels more well written and directed than the others. It's got a solid story with a great cast. It also has the most well choreographed fight scene out of any obsession film I've seen and that's why it's my most favorite. Deliver a good fight to the finish and then I'm all set. This movie isn't meant for critics, it's meant for people who want to relax and watch something fun.|, I saw this movie last night and when Dave grabbed Carter's neck, someone in the theater yelled, ""yeah get em dark skin"" 😂😂😂|, who ever created this trailer should also get an award, the scenes and the music were put together perfectly.|, this gave me chills. One of my friend's friend had this happen to her i cannot stress enough how scary it was listening to all the stuff the guy would do. i don't see this as ""another stupid movie"" this is something that really happens to some people in real life.Just shows how far some people will go when they have an obsession. Don't hesitate to get help or reach out to someone it could save your life|, This movie is just letting you know to not be consumed with chasing an image of someone, or what you think you need that you have created in your own mind. And to also not be consumed with comparing your life with someone else life. She started bashing her ex, and about what he should be after they visited their friends. Griping at him about something that he already discussed with her openly and honestly. She wasn't wrong for wanting to be with someone that wanted the same things that she wanted per se. But it was the way she was consumed with the persona that Michael Ealy portrayed of himself.|, If you say Michael in his role as a serial killer on 'The Following' then you know his acting abilities are immense. I cannot wait to see this movie. Way to go Michael!!!!
|, this movie was awesome.  the actors were outstanding.  and the story was believable.  sanaa's character wasnt stupid at all.|, Good to see Michael Ealy in a powerful role. He is such a great actor, and really comedy is not his thing. ""Sleeper Cell"" was an excellent role he started in years ago, he gave and excellent performance. Just hope he gets more character driven roles moving forward, which he plays so well.|, That must have been the entire movie in the trailer there.... I guess there is no point watching it now."

I'm so proud that we get so progressive to even mention Iranian queer life ! keep going on guys! Love from Tehran ❤ دست خوش 😏|, Love ❤this movie and expecting more things from the lead actress. It is both very timely and at the same time Timeless…|, This trailer makes the movie seem more comedic than it is. It's more of a slightly funny family drama/medical drama rather than a slightly dramatic comedy movie. Be prepared to tear up often rather than laugh. A lot of audio is strangely cut off or added in post.. some subplots/substories are never followed up with like what happened with Leila's script-writing that introduced her mom's story or where's Vahid at the end. Does Vahid know the truth? The trailer introduces the brothers but we barely see anything about the brothers in the movie. Colorful visuals and everyone (especially Shireen's) makeup was done amazingly well. Some jokes were good, sometimes seemed like they should've been memes but ended up in the movie. This movie wasn't really bad for me but it was quite a mess.|, I saw this at Sundance and I was really moved by it, it’s better than this trailer makes it appear.|, So much better than the trailer can convey|, I am excited for this film. So looking forward to this gem! 💎|, Can't wait to see this colorful and hilarious GEM... terrific casting, 💥💥|, When the borders are made up of non-penetrated walls and dispersing misinformation conquers our world, movies like this may demonstrate how an isolated culture can be fruitful and vibrant.|, Ok, teaching him Shut Up instead of GoodBye really made laugh.

Fucking amazing.|, Still one of the most underrated films of the 21st century.|, Seriously underrated movie, the way it shows how lives can cross and leave devastating consequences was amazing and heartfelt.|, I just finished watching this movie and I came straight here to see what others thought of it. I thought it was incredible, it totally blew me away. I got more and more engrossed in it as the film went on and I didn't want it to end. It would be amazing if there were to be a sequel made, I want to know what happened to Jason in his life after he bought the bike at the end and rode off.

This is a masterpiece in my opinion, I love movies like this. Movies that have that neo-noir feel to them, that are slow and captures the emotion and tries to tell a story that means something and continuously draws you in. and those movies that have those intertwining/linking plots that kinda makes you feel like you're solving a mystery along with the characters. It totally beats 90% of the the big budgeted Hollywood garbage.|, This movie is so deep.. The Emotions you go through is crazy...Recomend it 100%|, 10 years later and this movie still doesn't get the recognition it deserves. A melancholic masterpiece that depicts corruption, poverty, breaking generational curses and overcoming grief. 
Also, Ryan Gosling deserved an Oscar for his acting here, he made u feel his character's pain and regret. You empathize with him and you root for him to redeem himself. Every scene he was in was perfection.|, I wish the storyline had more of Goslings role. But, appreciate the directors ambitious story telling ,trying to capture the consequences of choices across generations in a sub 3 hour movie. Brilliant background music. seamlessly accentuates the mood of the film|, This movie had me bawling when I watched it back in 2015. It was and still is my favourite. I never found another movie that stirred my emotions and haunted me like this one did. And also the soundtrack - The Snow Angel by Mike Patton <3 everything about it is just beyond beautiful|, Seriously one of the most underrated films ever! A perfect story about fathers, sons, and consequences.|, This film really made me see the side of desperate criminals like I never have before. It felt like he had no other choice. I could identify with that feeling of money answering all of your problems and just feeling like you’d never have access to any real life changing cash without taking desperate measures. He was talented in his own way and could have been a stunt man or something. The saddest part of the movie for me was when he called before getting shot and asked for his son to never know about him because he was ashamed and would’ve wanted him to be proud of him. Mendez character loved him so much too. All in all pretty heart breaking film 💔"

The Pope's Exorcist,THE POPE&#39;S EXORCIST – Official Trailer (HD),YJXqvnT_rsk,22373404,110885,7408,"what i love about the exorcist stuff is that demons that posses can snap necks, levitate, throw shit across the room without touching them but they just can't get out of bed.|, Saw it with my husband last night and had similar comments. As a Catholic, it's nice to have a depiction of a priest who's faithful, likeable and charming. I think this movie shows the power a world class actor has to elevate an otherwise average film. Russel Crowe made this movie so enjoyable. Nothing felt offensive or preachy. At the end of the day, it was just good old fashioned Hollywood entertainment. The other compliment I would give is to the camera work. There was something about the angles and movement that felt good.|, Just finished watching the movie! 10/ 10. I recommend that everyone watch it. Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast nailed their roles perfectly!👌🏽|, I read one of Fr. Amorth's books. He's very upbeat, positive and sounds like a fun person. Even though he was dealing with absolute horror he had no doubt that God had his back, he was almost completely fearless. These movies exaggerate typical exorcisms but there are usually 1 or 2 that are particularly nasty. The church has gotten very good at preventing exorcisms from getting out of control. They've had 2,000 years to know what to do and what not to do. They are careful to rule out mental illness as well. I mean who wants to waste time doing an exorcism ritual on someone who isn't possessed?|, This really has the feel of a mystery behind the horror which I love. And Russel like plays the veteran detective. This is based on a real man where he performed about 10,000 exorcists. Russel got to know the people The exorcist worked with and he said you can tell that these people truly believe they had these experiences whether you believe in it or not. I personally have had demons whisper to me vile things in a different language but I understood what they were getting at during a sleep paralysis episode. After that there’s no doubt in my mind these entities exist and when I prayed to Jesus I haven’t had an episode since. There are countless stories like mine. Look up the asbury revival exorcism and listen to the scream that comes out of the ladies mouth. It’s authentic footage. Hundreds of people were there. Evil absolutely does exist and is not subjective.|, Absolutely loved this movie. I didn't watch any trailers or read anything about it prior to watching it, I went to the theater one day, saw a poster with Russel Crowe as an exorcist and said ""say no more"". I went in hoping for a fun exorcist movie, and that's exactly what I got!|, For Russell Crowe to be in an exorcist movie, means that the script was worth it|, I've read one of Father Gabriel Amorth's books. They have plenty of terrifying material to work with. Also if you have done any research into the rites of exorcism you'll find his name is everywhere. Russel Crowe is a great actor, he's had some not so great roles lately. I feel like this could and should redeem that. 

There are a lot of really good books, interviews and witnesses in addition to other media types they can use for this. I hope the writers took this job seriously, Father Amorth deserves nothing less for his legacy RIP|, I know everyone pays their tribute to the amazing work Russel Crowe did with this move, I mean he made the whole move actually whit the personality he gave to the priest, but let’s also appreciate this little boy who played the demon! I don’t know how so young little boy managed to pull out this role! He was amazing too❤|, Man! This is hands down the best horror movie I’ve ever watched. No cheesy jump scares, dialogue and stupid characters. Went in completely blind: watched no trailers or anything, the movie is so immersive, it pulled me in immediately ( probably because of the joint I smoked before going in to watch 😂) This movie is a horror gem.🔥"
The Possession of Hannah Grace,THE POSSESSION OF HANNAH GRACE - Official Trailer (HD),RHAgri92JP8,13213261,68618,4025,"Honestly, normally, I can watch every single horror movie, be a little scared while watching and walk out of theaters and forget I even saw it. I don’t really get terrified. For some reason, this movie really haunts me even a day later. There was something so terrifying and nightmarish about the atmosphere and the way the cadaver looks. I think it was a really scary movie, I don’t really understand the negative reviews.|, I don’t really care what the other people would say about this movie, but for me it’s such a great movie and kinda motivate me a lot by the last few words that Megan Reed said. It boosts up my mood for 2k19.|, This movie was so well done. It’s not what you expected at all. There was so many times where i assumed something was going to happen and was just completely off|, This is actually a really creepy movie, the way they filmed her moving and stalking genuinely freaked me out.|, This movie was great. I don't know why it's so underrated. Shay Mitchell gave us a great performance, just as the actress who played Hannah Grace. The plot was very simple but they managed to make it interesting. It was not as scary as ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"", but it still gave me a few jump-scares. 
I would totally recommend this to a horror movie fan. It's a good watch, especially if you watch it at night. It's something that does not ""traumatize"" you like other horror movies but still manages to keep you interested till the end.
There are also a few good phrases (I love it when in movies they say something that you involuntary keep in mind).
However, I do not recommend it if you are sensible to corpses in movies and dead people. 
Overall, it's a very good movie that I would gladly watch a second time.|, Definitely worth a watch. The lighting, setting and sounds were perfect. Had my siblings and I on edge and generally scared.|, The Autopsy of JD doesn't have any jump scares but the every revelations of her corpse makes the movie worth to watch, simple and yet creepy.|, I loved it! The atmosphere, sound, and timing really nail it.|, The Autopsy of Jane Doe was scary and creepy, and I've been wanting another movie like that to come out. Well, here it is. I hope it doesn't disappoint!|, Exceeded my expectations,  really great horror, something a little unique to your typical horror flicks these days. Didn't seem low budget and really great acting. It did not disappoint in my books"
The Post,The Post | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,nrXlY6gzTTM,18194422,24520,2817,"This was the best time I've had at the movies in years. Finally a movie without superheroes, crashing cars, college humor, the apocalypse,  or aliens. A movie about reality and adults in adult situations. Sometimes Hollywood does get it right.|, Sent chills to my spine. This movie is so powerful and the fact that it actually happened in real life is what makes the actors so much more real to their character's strong portrayals. RESPECT!|, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Meryl Streep are my favorite childhood icons growing when I was a kid and seeing them together became an incredible experience for when I saw this in theaters with my parents and my brother.|, Never thought I'd see Bob Odenkirk in a film with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. Props to him, he's a great actor.|, Extraordinary film with an extraordinary cast. I am a huge fan of Spielberg, loved every bit of this movie.|, I hope Meryl Streep gets her fourth Oscar. She deserves it!|, A very good movie. But as a TV show buff I was especially geeked out by the cast. I loved the Bob Odenkirk - Matthew Rhys scene, as I'm a huge fan of both Better Call Saul and The Americans. There were also people from the cast of Fargo and The Office involved. An amazing cast for secondary characters!|, I really loved this movie and think it’s incredibly underrated. I love Spielbergs historical character driven films the best. Lincoln, bridge of spies, Schindler’s list. This movie and bridge of spies I think are both extremely overlooked but are both fantastic. Bridge of spies has the more memorable hanks performance who always delivers when Spielberg is involved. But the ensemble cast in the post is awesome|, Watched this film a week ago. Terrific film all around. It is drama at its rare finest in recent films. Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, and all the other supporting cast were great! Spielberg has done it again!|, Only Spielberg can make a movie so good that the trailer can win an Oscar all by itself"
The Predator,The Predator | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,WaG1KZqrLvM,15094789,109296,12779,"This looks stupidly good i'm stoked!|, Someone described this film as a ""missed opportunity."" I agree. The Predator universe deserves a great movie.|, To make a real classic space monster movie, you gotta go with the top tier actor and top tier director along with skillful writers. That’s why the 1987 version is so awesome.|, Give me a Predator movie that has nothing to do with humanity. Show me their perspective, with their journey.|, I have to say that I love this franchise,and it's a pity that they don't know what to do with it,or they dont have enough money and good writers. Just saw the movie,I'll give it a 5 from 10,they could do a lot more,hopefully in the future they'll make a great job with Predator.|, In all seriousness, I completely forgot this movie ever existed. I'm watching prey and I thought I'd go through and make sure I'd seen every predator movie. When I saw this title in the list, I kept asking myself the same question: ""The Predator?"" Over and over. I've seen the movie. Just completely wiped it from my consciousness.

Edit: Thank you all for finding this relatable and the likes and comments. I've always wanted to be a Savage movie critic.|, I just want one movie, just *one* movie where the predators actually win.|, As I have mentioned before, I am looking forward to seeing this in theaters soon. And I do hope that it lives up to the hype since it does take a unique take on the franchise.|, Loved every single predator movie!! Watched the previous one more times than any other film! Can't wait to see this on big screen!!!|, The 1987 is one of the best movies ever made. I have rewatched it for years and years. This I barely wanted to finish."

I don't even mind the beard. :D|, OK so the older one dies and and younger one pretends 2 be the oldest one.     Right?|, 1:27 she got the cast on the left, and 1:28 it's suddenly on the right, that in a trailer ^^|, I loved this movie|, I'm so confused with this like wtf died.

Then in 2018 he took his own life, only a few months before Keith did the same thing. Me and my brother wanted it played at the cremation service but we got overruled (I guess it may not have been to everyone's taste!). Shame as it would have been a great way to honour his sense of humour. At least we got to play it at the wake.|, A perfect example of how can make a clip so stylish without using special effects. Perfection.|, man, this song hits so hard after all these years, and with a different feeling now.  RIP Keith you will be remembered for eternity|, Боги музыки 💪|, I was lucky enough to see  The Prodigy live. It was the most chaotic, intense and bonkers thing I've ever experienced! 🤟🤟🤟|, Without question one of the most iconic songs of the 90s|, 27 years later and this song sounds like it's from this time, even better than many songs from now...this band was on another level for that time|, I'm 32 years old, and these guys are still pumping!!! As I heard them at the age of 13 , I still jump breaking my knees ! Sleep well Keith!|, I still remember the first time I saw this video. I had no clue who these guys were. It was late at night in 1996 and MTV would play heavier music videos late at night. I fell in love with the video and the band after that first viewing. That was 27 years ago and it's still just as cool.|, This song can be 100 years old in the future and still never get boring such a quality song and video."

that line gets me everytime|, This is why The Producers is one of the most brilliant comedies ever written. Make a scheme to made a musical as offensive as possible so that it bombs and run off with the money, but it accidently becomes a parody as a result of the content.|, As the fictional reviews of the fictional play said. ""it was outrageous, offensive, and insulting, and I enjoyed every minute.""|, I’ll never understand why they keep adapting The Producers instead of making Springtime for Hitler a full scale musical.|, ""Watch out Europe were going on tour""

That line made me crack|, I had a weird dream about this being the german entry for Eurovision.|, One thing that's not funny about this scene is the choreography - it's seriously well done.|, I remember years ago, this was uploaded in its entirety and received a lot of backlash from people who had never seen the film and honestly believed this scene was fully intended to pay homage to Hitler.  Even if you've never seen the film before and are watching this out of context, you'd think the producer of the play saying 'Lets get out of here before they kill us' with a smile on his face would have made it obvious this play was meant to offend the audience watching it.|, I remember watching the musical in germany a few years ago and the whole theater died laughing everytime hitler showed up|, It was brave of Mel to produce such a musical film less than 25 years after the end of the horror, and the success confirmed it"

She always delivers!|, Maggie Q is simply the bad ass of action movies. She once again proved herself to be one of the best action movies' actresses in the current era. I think I'm going to watch Nikita, the series again.|, Loved Maggie Q since Naked Weapon. Nikita, Divergent, Stalker, Die Hard, Mission Impossible 3. Anything with Maggie in it, I'm into it no doubt!!|, With Martin Campbell directing I am absolutely confident this will be an excellent action film. He knows how to do action practically, none of that CGI BS.|, As long as there's Maggie Q, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Keaton, you know it's gonna be a kickass film ❤|, I absolutely LOVED Nikita so to see Maggie Q back in assassin/ass-kickin mode is awesome.  Throw some Sam Jackson and Michael Keaton on top of it and I'm SO for this movie.|, Maggie Q is like fine wine. Her beauty just gets more refined with the passage of time! Classical Beauty.|, I’m so gonna go see her movies ! Been her fan since Nikita !
She’s incredibly talented and beautiful!
She needs her own superhero character!!!|, I watched this tonight on Netflix and it was fun. The dialogues were good and funny! The action was great. I've loved Maggie since Naked Weapon.|, My love for Maggie Q is immeasurable, she's good at what she does."

It can be a comedy with some clever written dialogues inside the home and outside the killing spree is going on. That would be a unique and interesting movie.|, All crimes are legal for 24 hours


Me: finds the man who invented 15 second ads that you cant skip|, This would be terrifying if it were to be real.|, I remember watching this for the first time and I couldn’t sleep for 3 days……now 5+  years later I watch it like it’s a normal movie 😂|, “All crime is legal”


Me: takes my own food to the movies|, It’s crazy how huge of impact this franchise has in pop culture.|, This is the only horror movie that actually scares me.|, So, if a criminal who's in jail breaks out during the purge, do the police come after them when the purge is over?
Or is it a reward or something"
The Purge: Anarchy,The Purge: Anarchy - Theatrical Trailer (Official - HD),XzFCDqKE4yA,18590516,48611,9640,"I loved this movie, especially the part where those rich ppl got pwned and when the poor ppl fought back.
The ending was great.
This movie is well made and so much better than the first one.|, This movie was amazing. I was entertained throughout the whole movie, it also gave some scares which a lot of overrated psychological horror movies failed to give me. What really scared me is how the malevolent murders were wandering in the town staring at the townspeople devilishly  before even the night of the purge was announced, like they were craving for this bloody night. Also, the fact that all the people are valueless at this particular night is really scary. |, I feel like Frank Grillo’s character added an emotional core to this movie that was absent in the other two films. He’s a guy who has been seriously fucked over by the system and wants justice but instead of killing the person who wronged him he ends up saving innocent people and in the end has the chance to kill the guy but spares him because he has been changed by what he goes through in the film. And I love how that scene is shot, he goes in to kill him and it cuts to him leaving without showing whether he did it or not, and then the guy ends up saving him. I know I’m totally over-analyzing the film but i thought that aspect of it was powerful.|, This was the absolut best movie I have ever watched in my entire life time. It is filled with horror, dystopian, action, tragedi, triller all in 1 movie. I don't know how one could accomplish that in around 2 hours. The actors were so good. I am impressed.|, This is one of the rare occurrences where the sequel is better than the original|, In my opinion this is the best Purge movie out of all of them 🤷‍♂️|, If the purge was real then i'd get some books from the library and not take them back.|, the movie was surprisingly good. its not a horror, its more of a suspense film.! I WANT THE PURGE 3 RNN|, This movie is amazing. If your someone that likes suspense this is definitely a movie for you.  |, Imagine a purge actually happening in the United States today.
Literally everyone would hide at home and only a few psychopaths would kill each other in the streets lmao"
The Purge: Election Year,The Purge: Election Year - Official Trailer (HD),RXMp9fBomJw,11553199,52549,9047,"What's great about the purge series is the different viewpoints in each movie. The first one shows the lives of the rich and their beliefs and anarchy shows the struggles of the poor. I honestly can't wait for this one to come out|, Damn remember when we all thought the Purge was too far-fetched to happen?|, one of the best chapters of the saga, very deep in the human madness, in a surrounding filled to the brim of crime, chaos and terror, how evil is promoted to other countries, but with a little hope to put end to the nightmare, although with unexpected consequences.|, When you realize this movie was warning us about 2020 the whole time|, Unique franchise they're building.  It'll be interesting to see where they go next.  Looks like they're converting it to a highly violent action thriller opposed to the horror vibes they pushed in the first|, I can't believe that a couple of years ago I couldn't imagine myself watching this movie and right now I feel like I am addicted to it.
The Purge Election Year was the best movie that I've seen so far.
And the ending of the movie was insane!|, This is one of the few rare movies that keeps on getting better, let's hope it stays that way.|, Does anyone else remember when the first purge movie came out people dressed like this and went to different cities on days and actually did the purge? Because I remember they did one at San Francisco on the day I was going and I was like ""I'm gonna die!"" But instead of killing people they just played pranks like toilet papering cars and graffitied most of the city. Lol😂|, I just love the purge the concept is so ludicrous and original you can't help but like it|, One day until the election and life is about to imitate art."

Agora, lembrei de A Piramide Vermelha, o livro do Rick Riordan, bem que a FOX filmes podia adaptar o livro para o cinema!!!|, I just finished watching this movie and I REALLY liked it.  Would absolutely watch again.|, When you watch it and you have seen what happened to the person at the end, then you realize that the ""Monster"" now knows the way out of the Pyramid and is free to wreck havoc upon the world. So it would be interesting to watch a sequel to this film.|, Wow, a horror movie that I might actually want to see! It feels like alien only in the pyramid.|, This movie gave me chills.|, A pretty decent movie. Saw it in 2015, and givin it a replay today.|, Liked it...

Everything is perfectly real and gorgeous: the acting, directing, cinematography, the score, the book is based on. Everything. A raw and important reminder that children need love and tenderness to blossom. And that our families of origin aren't necessarily our real ones.|, Beautiful, heart-felt film. I was emotionally wrung out watching it, but in the best possible way. A proud moment in Irish cinema for sure.|, A very special movie and very moving. Beautifully filmed, scripted and acted. For me the ending was quite emotional, and made me want to go and hug my young children forever. Little children are such beautiful things, so precious and so vulnerable. They need unconditional love and a solid foundation and this movie really captures all of this. Warm thanks from Sydney - Dave (my wife has Irish heritage so it was doubly special)!|, This movie left me in bits 
The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful too 
If only cinema was this good all the time 
One of the best I have seen in the last five or so years 
Beautiful|, So glad to finally see this film (in the theater) the other night.  Absolutely wonderful.  The movie walks a delicate path between joy and heartbreak and never steps wrong.  Movies like this are rarely made anymore, especially here in the U.S.  I look forward to more from this director.|, ""Many's the person missed the opportunity to say nothing, and lost much because of it."" Brilliant.|, Teared up at the end of this when I first saw it 6 months ago. A really simple story that’s beautifully told and phenomenally acted|, This movie was like a meditation; so vivid, so nuanced, so beautiful, so heart wrenching , so heart warming, and I so loved and felt every moment of it!!!!|, A film resonating with every beautiful heartbeat of a caged little bird ,unable to utter her voice or fly to freedom .Beautiful  and painful in the extreme .No film like it this year ,oscar material but no doubt will be as overlooked Caitlin was by her family .Beautiful empathetic score undying its ambience .|, Loved this painfully relatable movie. The acting and directing, the powerful emotions in the subtleties, is why I love good films like this one."
The Quiet Ones,The Quiet Ones (2014) - Official Trailer #1,1GNyQusclgw,3262505,8238,1091,"I found this to be an excellent movie. The new incarnation of Hammer Films has truly come into its own with sumptuously sinister cinema, such as ""Wake Wood"", ""The Woman In Black"", and ""The Quiet Ones"".

Plus, I feel that it was a stroke of brilliant casting to have Jared Harris lead the cast of younger actors. Mr. Harris definitely has the skill and presence to measure up to any of the founder Hammer stars, and his performance was (for me) a high point of the project.|, This looks terrifying!!! So excited to see Sam Claflin in a horror film. Cannot wait.|, We waited so long for this movie! and it was worth the wait! Can't wait to see Sam in it :)|, The Quiet Ones is an old school slow burn/build up horror film. I have watched a few of the newer Hammer offerings and the acting is much better that the average horror film. There is a discernable plot with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing without being convoluted.  As an avid horror fan Ive seen hundreds of horror films I really recommend this movie. I give it an 8/10|, Saw this film a couple of nights ago, at first I thought it was a bit boring and something I had already seen before. But it got better, a few creepy parts and I liked the actors. I can't deny I am a big fan of the found footage and even though many people say it's worn out, I think this is a good addition. |, The experiment begins this April... Watch the official trailer for  #TheQuietOnes  and SHARE... if you dare.  #TrailerThursday|, jarred Harris is like a warm hug during a horror movie. you know everything is going to be okay when he talks.|, Saw it last night, for my partner's early b-day treat. Wasn't too bad, more intriguing as it's ""inspired"" by ""actual events"". Through the credits they show pictures of the people depicted in the film, and at the end as well there's a possibility that there could be a sequel. But I didn't find it 'scary', though my partner was jumping about in his seat! XD But hey he picked the film. Not my cup of tea, Hollywood is really running into the ground when it comes to good Horror flicks. |, Enjoyed this movie, worth watching. Based on actual events!|, My friend told me this movie was terrible,but I went to see it anyways. I've seen countless horror movies before,so I'm pretty used to being disappointed in horror films,but surprisingly I LOVED this one. I'm very impressed with this considering I'm more of a ghost/spirit/demon fan when it comes to horror movies,and there aren't many good ones out. Although many are saying this is terrible, I highly recommend everyone to still give it a chance and watch it,because I did and do not regret seeing it at all. I hope others like this movie as much as I did,because I really enjoyed this film."

It’s also about breaking them, and that you can’t make everyone conventionally happy. That in the end, it comes down to only 1. And the tension lies in who that one will be and what happens to the rest of them. 
It’s better than stringing them all along or going for the “I choose all of you” Route.|, I binge watch this last weekend just for the movie and I saw it today in dub. It was so amazing and I’m glad I only had to wait a week to see this conclusion.|, Imagine if there was an Anime with a bunch of Quintuplet sisters who all become Idols and form their own unique Idol unit.|, i rewatch this trailer daily, this series is so beautiful ❤. glad we getting more anime content!|, I already know which of the quintuplets Futaro chooses.

He was at Bhopal junction, inhaled the poison to clear the railway traffic to stop trains from coming to bhopal and clearing ones already in the section.  

He got extremely infected thankfully some good deeds and prayers saved him and my whole family.

Can say lots of railway men like him served that night putting own life at stake|, My dad was 31 when he suffered 1st heart attack while saving lives of many in bhopal when ppl were in a bus and their driver ran away my dad drove tht bus out of the city later he suffered a heart attack luckily he survived tht time but after few years he left us. Nobody knows about him about that incident how my dad bravely helped many ppl he's an unsung hero he always said one thing daayen haanth se kaam aisa kro ki baayen haanth ko bhi pata na chale.❤|, I have learned about the gas leak in Bhopal at school, but seeing the series was a whole different  level experience, it was definitely heartbreaking. 
The bravery of the railway men was beyond incredible. 
The ordinary, imperfect men acted when mostly corrupt politicians were out of touch with reality and focused on their interests. 

It’s a must watch.|, Finished this 4 episodes series and must say it perfectly encapsulated the helplessness, valour and united struggle of common citizens who became victim of this tragedy. All actors were phenomenal and direction was top notch.|, I am basically from Kerala but my maternal family is settled in Bhopal. My mom has told me about the tensed situation during that time. This tragedy happened in old Bhopal and my grandparents and mom and uncles were in new Bhopal so they were safe. But seriously this was a huge tragedy and it's so great to see this series been made!|, I usually take my time to finish a web series. But the first episode of this particular web series simply forced me to finish it at one go. This has to be once in a lifetime masterpiece in the history of Indian web series. Absolutely spine chilling facts were displayed which have been hidden from our public since ages due to the corrupt politics of our netas. My heartfelt condolences to the entire victims and survivors of this tragic incident. And special kudos to the entire team of The Railway Men.❤❤😊😊|, I live in bhopal. My grandfather died during this leak. Probably the biggest man made disaster in India which destroyed countless family. This trailer made me emotional. How the people survived here itself a huge milestone.|, One of the best series I've seen in a while..... Really fills you up with pride to see the valour of your fellow countrymen at times of need. A must watch. The cast is fantastic. Babil Khan and KK Menon gave an amazing performance worthy of applause. The entire cast even the supporting characters were very convincing. A truly thrilling experience.|, Just finished the 4 episodes. Man, what an experience! I had learned about BGT in study and knew it had a heavy casuality, but it was just a number to me. But after finishing the series, it felt like getting first hand experience how bad the deal was with the gas leak and why it wasn't just a number. The emotions really felt spine chilling. It truly changed my way viewing it. All the heroes who sacrificed themselves to protect people will be forever memoralised. 

There should be more content of topic dealing with this kinds of scenarios in the bollywood industry. Honestly all the words are few when I am thinking about praising the show.|, As a chemical engineering graduate from Malaysia, I was taught about the Bhopal incident and how dirty, nasty and greedy corporations can be. This will live on as a cautionary tale for chemical engineers for generations to come..my lecturer said if only they taught the people around them about emergency measures...by wetting rags and putting it on their face they couldve prevent this humanitarian disaster and saved everyone around the plant"

Although my parents separated when I was very young, my grandmother told me that, when they were dating, they used to sit and read poetry to each other.  I was named for the Lenore in this poem almost seven decades ago but must confess that until tonight I had never read The Raven.  I am actually glad because tonight I have just heard it, for the first time, recited in the most profound way and it makes me realize the passion my parents must have felt for language and each other, if only for a little while.|, Sir Christopher injects so much raw emotion and pain through his words......it's hauntingly beautiful|, Rhyming “window lattice” with “what thereat is” is still one of my favorite things Poe has ever done. Gets me every time.|, Sir Christopher Lee. The only man who could take a beautiful poem such as this and somehow make it more sublime. Rest in peace, Sir. You are in paradise.|, In case anyone is wondering about how scary this was meant to be at the time: Elizabeth Barrett wrote to Poe, ""Your 'Raven' has produced a sensation, a fit o' horror, here in England. Some of my friends are taken by the fear of it and some by the music. I hear of persons haunted by 'Nevermore'.""|, The narrator does a good job showing the stages of grief in the raven.  Christopher Lee's voice brings the tale to life."

The Red Turtle,The Red Turtle Official Trailer #1 (2016) Studio Ghibli Animated Movie HD,Sw7BggqBpTk,2324005,27749,1178,"No, the movie is an allegory about facing up to the harsh reality of what life gives you; how you arrive to a point of accepting the direction your path leads you; and coming to terms with the role you end up playing within your lifetime. Going forward, it's what you do and how you make the best of your time here. Learning to respect and appreciation the inherent beauty of our earth and the lifetime of dangers such beauty can cause. What you won't see in this film is an action packed 90 minute Disneyfied chase scene that  causes epileptic seizures, Nor will you need ear plugs for an explosively thundering soundtrack that causes noise bleeds in THX audio. And best of all, you won't have to cringe through inane dialogue written primarily for preschoolers. It is a beautifully hand drawn animated film that is packed full of thought provoking emotion, mystery, and charm.  It is cinema in it's purist form.|, I watched this movie in a small theater for indie films and other smaller films with my childhood best friend and his family back in 2017 and I’ve always really loved how unique and peaceful this movie is. I still bring this movie up with him sometimes when we are chatting over the phone talking or while playing video games, or in person. Over the last few years ever since I became a young adult, the deeper meaning of the movie is something I’ve grown to like even more.|, For all of you saying that this trailer spoils the movie, you're wrong. There is so much more to this movie than what the trailer shows and its a compelling, beautiful story told so masterfully. Its really a fantastic movie|, This movie was a MASTERPIECE!  Studio Ghibli never fails .|, I saw it at the Sydney Film Festival and thought it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.  Each frame is like a beautiful, Japanese woodblock print.  The graduated colour shading is magnificent and the way that the water is animated is spectacular.|, My tears fell in the end... 😭😭😭 What a masterpiece Studio Ghibli. You left me crying...|, This movie is flawless. Absolutely stunning.|, This is an incredible, emotional movie. Brings me to tears every time.|, This was a masterpiece! The ending made me cry so much 😭. The background music was so deep..It felt like heaven.|, Esse filme é lindo demais!"

We read some of the Bible last night and did a prayer. My sister was scared because she was afraid that she wouldn’t seem worthy enough in God’s eyes, but I can see that she’s trying.|, Better than expected.

You are the real hero.|, As a former diver who did enough cave diving to realize it wasn't for me, I gotta say that it will take a lot of courage for me to watch this....... for me personally, those tight underwater spaces are things of nightmares.

Perfect cast, perfect soundtrack, and MORE than perfect cinematography. And that bear attack scene is my favorite movie scene of all time.|, DiCaprio's performance here was absolutely riveting and captivating here. His performance really grabs you and makes you feel the suffering that this character is going through. This is probably one of the best movies that I've ever seen.|, I adore this movie. Not many films where you can almost feel the wind/ fresh water or smell the trees as if you’re really there.|, Just loved the camera work done. The Continues single shots really made the movie feel very intense.|, The quality of this movie is just on a different level. I mean the camera work, the angles, the acting, the music, the scenes, it was almost surreal at times. It was so perfect, everything coordinated on point, like a symphony of things. I am thankful there are gutsy artists who put everything on the line for this, it could have been a disaster!! but it wasn't. I saw it twice already, must be seen in theaters.|, Its one of those movies along with LOTR, Shawshank Redemption and a few more that really ignites something deep inside me.

I'm into this role for her. I hope she gets to be a comic book villain soon. I think she'd be amazing as one.|, This was an amazing performance.  It gave an expression of depression that made me wonder how does someone go about capturing this on film.  It was original on many fronts.  It broke the formula of slick and together and presented raw and real.  After watching it I searched about it wanting to know more about it and the people behind it. I wanted to receive some empathy for emotions it captured and transmitted to me.  Instead I found the movie was poorly received and was scoffed at by both critics and the public.  Once again both industry and the public show a shallow need for the formulaic. They didn't appreciate the depth of depression, hopelessness and grittiness brought to them. Where I saw perseverance they saw clumsy, where I saw skill and artistry in filming they criticized.  I never get the mass public.|, I can't wait to see the whole movie! I'm sure this will be great. I love all of Blake Lively's movies! 😊❤|, Blake Lively is such an underrated actress... Savages was a movie that really showed what she can do in the raw/gritty action genre, I'm definitely seeing this one.|, Watching Blake Lively grow as an actress has been quite entertaining. This truly looks like a decent film. Fingers crossed! Also, I kind of hope this film has a lot more colour in it. The name of the film has me imagining such a bright and vibrant aesthetic feel to it.|, Actually thoroughly enjoyed this movie despite the lacklustre Google Reviews, Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. Not as face paced as I'd initially anticipated but a deep rooted story line and decent character development.|, Blake was incredible in  A Simple favor. Never even heard of her before.... having seen her in that film, she is  by far the most exciting actress of 2019. Looking forward to seeing all her work!|, Proud of Blake, she’s come so far from her gossip girl days.|, Can't wait for this. So impressed with everything Blake Lively does.|, This woman is fanamanal! What a versatile actress. She has surprised me again & again. She has surpassed all of her own performances!

The remoteness is an amplifier of all the elements you see generally in society: men without boundaries, tribalism, clashing of cultures, etc.|, Julia Garner really stood out to me in Ozark. Great series and also great performances throughout|, Brilliant casting. Two of my faves playing opposite of each other. If not for them, I'd probably pass on the film.

And also tells you that every moment even the little things always matters the most so cherish it well.|, My wife and I watched this a couple of weeks ago. We found it to be a quiet, reflective, deeply satisfying film about grief, self-blame, and redemption. Beautifully filmed, too. All three leads are wonderful. After watching it I read, with surprise, the predominately negative reviews of it. No, it's not perfect, but the almost universal pile-on by critics doesn't make any sense to me.|, I LOVED it!

I didn't realize Richard Gere is in this one. Looks as though it is going to be even better than the first. Great cast.|, Quite enjoyed the first. It was a real treat seeing such exceptional talents onscreen all at once. Also I thought the soundtrack and cinematography were simply wonderful.|, I am so very excited about this movie. I loved the first one and I am sure I will love the second one just as much.|, Saw this film long ago to forget it completely.
Obviously, the first time I have not seen it at all.

in the end of the film your heart might just burst couse of pleasure
and gladness.

I think it's a must to see the first film, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,
to have a complete picture.
Actually, it's a one story devided into two films.
The first one looks like an introduction of the story.
And this, second one is the main story and the end.
Actually there is no end. More like a clousure.

optimistic, life and love understanding films ever.|, This movie is HUGE LIFE LESSON!.... Such beautiful words of EPIC proportions!... Absolutely fantastic!!👏👏👏👏|, I can't wait for this movie to come out so I can watch it! It's full of witty characters and lines (19 day life wasp joke) and also Dame Judi and Dame Maggie as best friends! Who doesn't want to see that combo?? Maybe they should have added Julie Walters and Julie Andrews! I have to say that seeing the Jean Ainslie character return is a little disappointing, not that Penelope Wilton isn't a good actress, she's great! But it will be interesting to see who the Ainslie's daughter takes after. Can't wait!! :)|, OMG!!! I can't wait for this movie!

You can do anything if you put your mind to it.|, This is the most underrated, most beautiful, perfect, deep, astonishing, simple, happy movie I have ever seen.|, I left this movie feeling very inspired, my girlfriend felt the same way, my teenage son thought it was just okay. I believe this movie probably has a lot more meaning to people who are a little more experienced in life. And as a lot of people have been saying, the creativity in the cinematography was amazing and very original. This movie deserves far more recognition than it is getting.|, This movie inspired me to turn down a full-year internship at my dream company to study abroad instead. It was the greatest decision I've ever made and I owe it to this film for changing my life|, One of the most underrated movies of 2013. Great job Ben Stiller for directing such an unique and peaceful movie.﻿|, I enjoyed the movie, but this is actually my personal favorite movie trailer. No real dialogue, intriguing without giving any real details, paired with an excellent musical piece.|, This is one of the few movies that makes me cry every time I watch it. Walter’s daydreaming character is so relatable to me and many other people who often catch ourselves ever dreaming, never doing. It’s inspired me to have more courage and take big, scary steps to make my life more fulfilling! The incredibly relatable story, paired with a beautiful soundtrack and awe-inspiring cinematography has cemented this movie as perhaps the most significant movies in my life personally. I wish that everyone involved with the making of this movie could know the impact it’s had on so many people’s lives, in spite of its (surprisingly) terrible critic reviews on release.|, I loved this movie, made me think about my life I should start living and not just surviving...|, This movie was beautifully made. Ben stiller'a best movie hands down. The ending got me, don't wanna spoil it but it's an emotional scene|, Probably one of, if not THE, most underrated films of my lifetime.

Also, the actors are marvelous.|, Omg goosebumps. I read this book and had loved it because of the author's use of vocabulary, imagery, euphemism and whatever literary devices that I didn't manage to identify. Point is the writing was beautiful.

For others, I either watch and will not be reading (like Hunger Games/ GOT/ Maze Runner series/ Divergent series) or had read and didn't want to tarnish the image by watching the movie/series. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯|, It was a Male version of Atonement almost, very well acted. I cried in it a bit. The fact that he is mistaken about a key part of the story is what makes it moving for him to look back into his past and move on. GREAT CAST, Oscar nominations maybe for casting?.|, Предчувствие конца - это одна из моих любимых книг, которую я перечитывал несколько раз. Надеюсь, фильм получится достойным. Жду с нетерпением!|, I love this novel way too much 😭💛|, The trailer feels and seems so different to the image in my head when I read the book.|, beautifull movie; brought many tears to my eyes; fantastic crew of actors|, Just saw the movie here at the local theatre in Miami Beach with the wife and another couple - we all throughly enjoyed it.|, LOVE me some Jim Broadbent...actually this whole cast.

The Shack,The Shack (2017 Movie) Official Trailer – ‘Believe’,CL0yUbSS5Eg,11436009,37393,3661,"I read this book in jail. I randomly picked it up and it changed my life. I had a very hard heart towards God at the time calloused by drug use and the recent loss of my grandpa, who I was very close with. The book softened my heart towards God, and I became a Christian just a few months later after a near-fatal overdose. God will never leave you or forsake you, just turn to Him - let Him love you and heal you.|, Just found out about this movie on Netflix & I could not fight back the tears. I don’t care how tough & bad you think you are in this world, this movie should be your wake up call to trust in the Holy Spirit & have faith & learn how to live better in all aspects!!! Beautiful movie, actors & actresses!!|, I just watched this movie last night and I had no idea what I was in for. I am not a ""deeply"" religious person but I do believe in God and consider myself a Christian. After this movie ended I prayed to God and cried the entire time I was praying. We have no right to judge anyone as our minds cant comprehend the gravity of what every single decision we make means no matter how big or small. If you watch this and dont find yourself closer to God then i weep for you. Be a force for good in this world and you will be rewarded more than you could imagine. This is a must watch but be prepared and bring a few tissues with you when you sit down.|, I lost my little girl 4 year ago at the age of 4 in such a senseless freak accident. This film has helped me so much 💜|, I was struggling with my faith, prayed to God to help me, suddenly came across this movie. He never left me, He is always at work. Thank God.|, Most amazing film I've watched in a long time.. I've been feeling out of touch lately with the world, myself and God but this is exactly what I needed!! Thank god everyday for his guidance, strength and existence in my life!! He believes in me when I stop believing in myself!! Blessed!!|, This movie definitely takes any questioning Christian (all of us at some point) and breaks you down. Totally recommend watching it alone and letting yourself respond naturally. In my case - using a dozen tissues. Seriously a wonderful movie|, Quando o livro foi lançado, eu o li, o livro mudou minha vida e minha visão espiritual. Eu fui assistir esse filme no cinema, eu chorei muito em várias cenas, até hoje quando assisto o filme, ele me emociona. Eu desejo que, quem nunca assistiu o filme ou leu seu livro, faça isso, leia ou assista o filme, seu coração será tocado, vai mudar sua vida ❤️|, I don't remember any movie that caused me to cry as much as this one. But at the same time, it's the most beautiful and touching movie I've ever seen. I now own a copy. 💞💞💞|, I suddenly lost my mom on march 26,2017 and my pastor told me to watch this movie because I would be able to relate and it was the best advice I was given in a long time, this movie is awesome, I can't wait to read the book"

It just frightens me|, I thought this would be a terrible movie, so i didn't expect much when i saw it. But i was so so surprised by it. I thought it was a very beautiful movie - the way it was filmed, the colors and so -  that was remarkable. It had a strange quality to it - that i don't really know how to explain, but it certainly stood out to me. And the acting was good as well. I couldn't see how they could make an entertaining and interesting movie with just one actor alone, in one place. But it works really well in my opinion.|, A decent plot, real locations, not so much cgi and a good cast = a good movie.|, This is a brilliantly made movie, underrated as hell, amazing visuals and stunningly told. Really makes you tensed in situations. Wow a good shark movie after ages. Blake Lively really did an amazing job!|, I went to see this a few days ago and I have to say it was a pretty good movie. It has its flaws of course, but Blake Lively was AMAZING. She carried the entire movie by herself and did such a fantastic job. It's also a very well-shot movie, very aesthetically pleasing, and despite the expected ending, it still left me breathless at times. Go see it, criticize later.|, amazing movie, great acting, the scenario is brilliantly handled and the cinematography is breathtaking!|, Just finished watching this movie and LOVE it <3 Blake was superb and such a edge of your seat action/thriller! Theater was packed and we were all hyped haha such fun watching this and her survival planning! It never ceases to amaze me though how trailers always show things that never got to make it to the theater version so I hope they will be on DVD special features for deleted scenes :o|, IF THAT SEAGUL DOES NOT GET THE AWARD FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR/ACTRESS I WILL WILL CRY! LMAO. WHAT A PERFORMANCE! IM SURPRISED THAT BEAST DIDNT KILL THE SHARK! #SEAGULBEAST|, am I the only one who thinks she deserves at least an oscar nomination? I mean that part with the drunk man was amazing|, One of the best survival shark horror movies ever!"
The Shape of Water,THE SHAPE OF WATER | Official Trailer | FOX Searchlight,XFYWazblaUA,26634924,139595,9743,"even an underwater monster found love and here i am|, This movie takes a level of understanding, and it should not be kept to the surface of what's weird about it. Genuinely one of the best movies I've seen.|, This movie is beautiful, I love the story, the graphic, the message, etc.

For those who say this movie is weird, boring, ""beastiality"", that's alright you're free to have your own opinion, but I'm just wondering maybe if the actress was Emma Watson and the fish god was Zac Afron with fish tail most of you might react differently.|, This movie was hauntingly beautiful and captured the spirit of the early 1960’s to a T. I also like how the message here is one of tolerance—the idea that if we have time to get to know each other, we can look past people who are different from us and see each other for the common humanity of it all. I remember when this came out, I was 18 and had just finished my first semester of college.|, The soundtrack, the acting, the aesthetic, and the allegory of the story itself. Bravo! This movie is a masterpiece|, This movie was so beautiful ❤️ Just finished watching it and my heart is happy. I love how the main character is beautiful in a different way and very likeable and quirky. She doesn't look like a supermodel but her beauty is so fragile. And also,

SPOILER ALERT:

The film also tackles racism and homosexuality, the patriarchy and even how plenty of men seem bored with their beautiful and perfect housewives. Like, so many issues tackled but never too distracted to sway from the main plot which is that two beings love each other without prejudice. There's also love in friendship too. Love love loved it ❤️|, This is easily one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. Guillermo is truly a modern day master. Everything about this film is for film lovers.|, A lot of people talk about how horrible this movie is, but I bet they haven't even seen it. It's a masterpeice! A truly beautiful take on a fairy tale romance.|, I love this trailer. It's enough to give me the basics of what the film is about, but doesn't give away too much that you feel like you've seen the whole thing. It captures you, and really convinces you to watch. I also love the film. I've seen it twice in theaters and I got upset when today I discovered that it's no longer showing because I wanted to watch it again. It's now one of my ultimate favorites (along with V for Vendetta).|, I love this film!! It may come across as strange but it shows how love can come in in many different forms, this is a masterpiece"

Don't know how many times I have seen it,  but I could watch it over and over again and never get bored. 
First class story,  acting and casting, not just Morgan Freeman and Tom Robbins,  but the others as well. 
Absolute perfection.|, When ""End Title"" kicks in at 1:05, my eyes can't help but tear up. One of the greatest score cues in all of film.|, Not ""one of the"", it is the greatest movie of all time.|, One of the greatest movies ever, for sure a top 3 of all time, it really inspired me. It's a shame how WB turned into what it is today.|, I’m almost crying, The Shawshank Redemption Being on 4K for the first time was my dream come true, my favorite film of all time!|, This is one of my all time favorites, I laugh at the jokes still, get mad at the warden and capt of the guard still and when Andy walks out of all them banks with the warden's money I smile still|, Still one of the best movies of all time. I watch it annually.|, Absolutely heartwarming and inspiring film even throughout all the pain encountered within it, although it's funny they release a trailer for it about 27 years after its release. I guess its digital re release or something lol|, One of the greatest movies ever made|, It's about time! The greatest movie of all time deserves the 4K treatment."

Something you watch after a long, exhausted day, when you just want to relax and watch something not so dramatic.|, Tyler Perry never lets me down...always a great laugh...can't wait!|, Because nobody knows what it's like to be a single mom better than Tyler Perry|, My daughter told my to watch this trailer lol, since I'm a single mom I could relate. Looks like a great movie can't wait to see it.|, No matter how many times reviewers, critics, massive viewpoints that say his movies are shitty.

Now, four years later, Joaquin Phoenix and Jake Gyllenhaal are bringing it to life for all of us|, This movie is a gem! I thought Hollywood stopped making movies like these and I was right. It was made by European studios and a french director.|, The trailer makes it out to be a violent comedy, but the film focuses a lot on the brothers and their relationship. There are some very deep and dramatic moments, but some hilarious and heartwarming ones too. Of course there's the fun violence if you're into that. I enjoyed it.|, Great movie. No great exagerated popcorn spectacle. Just a movie about conflicted people. The kind of movie that silently improves the world of cinema. Glad to see this at the big screen|, Jake Gyllenhaal is on fire! Yesterday Wildlife, today The Sisters Brothers! Velvet Buzzsaw is also fairly soon and coming out October 26th. This could be the year he finally gets what he deserves for being an truly incredible and interesting actor that takes risks and chooses such fine films.|, There are some movie-going experiences that, when you're watching them, truly make one wonder, and, imagine how fun it would be to be an actor in Hollywood. This film is one of them. Joaquin. Great. Gyllenhaall. Great. John C. Reilly... Finally in a movie I want to really see him in, that's not a waste of his talent and appeal. Great!|, A very underrated film. The cinematography, the editing, the acting, the gun sound, it was all good.|, I see Jake Gyllenhaal, I click. I just adore him.  Why he doesn't have an Oscar yet, I do not know.  He only does quality films,  so this should be good.  The whole starring cast looks great,  actually.|, The river scene at the end absolutely killed me, I almost cried|, I randomly watched this movie at the theater when it came out and now i love it, at the time it was me and only two other people in the entire theater. Definitely an underrated flick!!!"
The Skeleton Twins,The Skeleton Twins Official Trailer (2014) HD,ll0pjiOjSiU,976712,10924,259,"This film was probably the most accurate portrayal of depression I’ve ever seen, particularly through Bill Hader’s performance.|, I watched this film yesterday (I'm a critic for a small Swedish magazine) and I loved it! It felt deep, personal, important but very funny and full of life. Though it's heavier than what the trailer tells you, I definitely recommend seeing it!|, 2 comedians playing very dramatic roles. I can respect that.|, An absolute gem. Anyone who has ever felt depressed or been depressed will appreciate this movie. Amazing performances from Kristen and Bill.|, A really refreshing film. There aren't enough movies about the special relationship between siblings and Wiig is outstandingly charming in this role. |, I remember watching the trailer when it first came out and I made my 8 year apart twin sister we had to watch it and we bawled like babies watching it because it was sooooooo related and made us closer than what we already were and I get emotional every time I watch it|, someone told me they thought bill hader would be uncomfortable doing the gay (subtext) scene in it 2 and i was like “do you even know bill hader” he is so comfortable with his masculinity and sexuality that he can play gay characters and not be embarrassed or ashamed|, one of the best movies about mental illness I’ve seen. also so beautiful.|, I think it's amazing and seeing Kristin Wiig, who I knew she had the acting chops, and Bill Hader doing roles like this really shows their acting range it's actually an amazing movie it's officially one of my favorite movies|, Finally got to watch it this morning. It was so beautiful I actually wound up crying like a baby.
10/10 my new favorite film."

The Souvenir,The Souvenir | Official Trailer HD | A24,t9Al2nC0vzY,1300467,9961,426,"This film is an absolute masterpiece. I was able to catch a screening at Sundance last month, and wow. I was completely blown away. Every shot is crafted to perfection, and the dialogue specifically is maybe the best I’ve seen in any movie ever. The Souvenir will undoubtedly go down in A24 history as one of the greats!|, This looks absolutely mesmerizing and it always take me ages to recognize Tilda Swinton in every role. She's a true chameleon who truly dessapears into her characters.|, I had the fortunate chance of seeing The Souvenir at the Berlin Internationa Film Festival. It was the best movie I have seen in a long time. Absolutely everything about this film was so elegantly done and there was no minute passing by where I felt uninterested. Loved the characters, the actors and especially the writing and the direction. Joanna Hogg really showed off with this one. I am glad to see this film getting picked up by A24. I am also super stoked for the second part!|, This movie made me to remember a long-term relationship I used to have when I was 18. I fancied a guy who was working at a charity, 15 years older, a huge fan of Belle and Seb, and had bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. He was my first love. He was kind, sweet, mysterious to me--but kept going off-the-ground a few times, and eventually vanished. I moved on, but now I know he was going through a hard time on his own and didn't even know what to do with that relationship. That whole experience was confusing and devastating for me, and I'd isolate myself from my friends and academic goals--I had a terrible grade at my art school that term. That depressing relationship made me grow up into who I am now, but I'd never go back if I have a chance. I used to curse this guy for a while, but after watching this movie--I'm not sure if he's even alive right now, but if he is, I just wish the best for him. Hope he doesn't have to deal with the darkness at all.|, i went and saw this last night. 
Never seen anything like it before. Really beautiful and so touching! 
Even tho there were parts where i felt like falling asleep...even then it felt like those moments were just part of the atmosphere, at times wanting to scream, that the main character finds herself in....and makes the coming alive parts even more beautiful. Loved it.|, Such a beautiful masterpiece. Tilda shines as always and the story, directing, music and editing style are superb. but Honor Swinton is the heart and soul of this film, her acting was as masterful as her mother's!|, loving this socre...a24 rarely dissapoints me...thumbs up to the production team|, Tilda Swinton in an A24 film is promising enough.|, Saw this movie on a plane and thought it was an excellent drama.  I thought it was made in the 1980s or 90s because no one uses a cell phone and was pleasantly surprised to see it was a recently produced.  I felt a deep sense of nostalgia for a time when people communicated as 'people' not as cell phones and texts.  The emotional conflict in a relationship tainted with (drug) abuse is painted vividly.  Well done!!!|, Looks incredibly lush and well shot.  Can't wait to see this!"

Maybe b/c when I watched it, I was going through something similar to what happens in the movie. It opened my eyes to a lot of things I overlooked. So I’m looking forward to watching the second part.|, Part one was a gem. A masterwork in my opinion. I can’t wait to see this.|, This film have hit me in all corners cause I've also struggled with substance abuse & made me realized how it affected my loved one's. Surprised that its going to get sequel.|, First one was great didn’t think it needed a sequel but looks promising|, Art film sequels are back baby|, Honestly, I'm a huge fan of A24 movies. The creaters, and directors  bring a new, ""hip&modern""  world to independent movie making,  and I think it is divine.|, Well, shit, now I have to watch The Souvenir. Richard Ayoade is life!|, I mean... you had me at Richard Ayoade.|, I can't wait for part 3!

You are the one
Thing in my life
I know I did right

Where have you gone?
I know it's not wrong
But my heart always knew
You belonged within it

I'll be there in a day
If the constellations luminate my life

I thought it was going to be a typical, predictable romcom. I was wrong. Glad I gave this movie a chance. Both Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley played very good parts - you almost forget that they are acting. This movie has a deep message and can be enjoyed by all age groups.

Breath taking.|, Watching trailers all day and avoiding homework﻿|, Honestly, this is one of the best films of the decade. There is so much honesty, emotion, and truth throughout the entire film. I cared so much for these characters to the point that I wish I could have called them a few days after I saw the film to see if they were doing okay. A powerhouse of a film!|, This movie was incredible.  It was a teen romance that didn't talk down to its audience but treated its characters with dignity.   Both of them are great actors.|, such a good film for teens. at first, it seems like a classic high school love story, but its more than that. its a movie that showcases the hardships that you go through on a daily while also figuring out who you truly are. 10/10 recommend this|, This movie was surprisingly good! It's like they weren't even acting... loved it! 8.5/10|, This trailer does do the movie justice. The actors and whole movie in general is so real and literally when I finished the movie I stayed up thinking about it, absolutely amazing movie |, The trailer does the movie no justice with how amazing it is, the characters are so raw and realistic and full of emotion and the dialogue for the first time actually feels like what actual teens would say in real life. 10/10 a wonderful coming of age story that everyone should see."

Good for Kate McKinnon get that second top billing.|, This is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. Just watched it with my sister and we laughed so much. Kate is hilarious and Sam is such a BABE!!! (Didn't know who he was before seeing him in this.) WATCH IT!!! :D|, I saw this with friends and was expecting it to be dumb but it was actually one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Funny and lots of plot twists - not predictable at all!|, I love how everyone crushes hard for Kate McKinnon here but we all collectively died for Gillian Anderson|, ""What?! You're the boss?! And yet you have not sacrificed one OUNCE of femininity. That is Beyoncé of the government."" Great writing.|, The world needs a sequel for this movie!

The Square,The Square - Official Trailer,EUzRjRv0Ib0,1079116,5955,279,"This was such a fascinating film. It asks so many thought-provoking and challenging questions on human nature and the responsibilities of both individuals and societies.|, This movie blew my mind. I was laughing outloud one minute and yelling at the guy the next minute -- ""Just freakin go apologize, dammit!"" And ""why don't you stand by your decisions, dammit!"" 

And the dining room performance scene, I went from laughing and gasping in an amused way to feeling totally scared and horrified (there should be a trigger warning for people with PTSD for that scene).  

It's the measure of a good movie when you keep thinking about it once it's over, and ask yourself questions about what YOU would do in the different situations. 

It's also a wonderful spoof of Swedish culture (let's bring a crying baby to work and act like it's not bothering other people, and let's keep an interview going with someone with tourette's yelling expletives because, after all, as Swedes we pride ourselves on being respectful and inclusive no matter what). 

And the condom scene.

And then there's the whole pot of worms around the people sleeping on sidewalks and begging for money. 

And the perennial question -- is it art?

It's a really complicated movie (I'm not sure I'd call this a comedy), without being preachy, supremely well acted and you never know where it's going next. 

Part of me wants to watch it again and part of me says, ""Oh no, once was enough, thank you.""|, Never heard of this film, but after watching Triangle of Sadness I'm definitely going to watch it.|, Il était tellement marrant ce film! J'ai adoré!|, A really good film. I wasn't impressed with the director's previous film at all and when this started I wasn't quite getting it but then it won me over.|, I loved this so many great scenes!!!
Claes  Bang does not disappoint!!!
He’s he’s funny and sexy!!!|, Essentially a film about karma and the importance of being a good person and being aware, empathetic and respectful of others over your career and ego.  Enjoyable but needed more editing in final third.|, Must watch movie! I was puzzled, entertained and disturbed by this movie. I liked both the apologies in this movie. Sometimes it is possible to make you feel you are right inside in a scene in a movie, I felt that when she asks him about the sex they had and there is this irritating tumbling rattling sound behind them😖.|, Play (2011) was one of the most fascinating movies I've ever seen so I'm looking forward to watching this tonight|, I am from Indian after watching the square movie I am the big fan of Ruben it very sensible screenplay and Stylish direction"
The Strangers: Prey at Night,The Strangers: Prey at Night Trailer #1 (2018) | Movieclips Indie,91-Z20uttEk,5822380,32225,3074,"Prey: ""Leave us alone!""
Killer: ""Okay.""

Literally never.|, I saw the original in theaters and absolutely  loved the simplicity of it.  2 victims, 3 killers, grounded in reality, no ghosts, zombies, Japanese based phantom girls. No cheap jump scares. Just good old classic American shock and terror of mid to late 70s exploitation films. It also provided plenty of atmosphere and suspense which was truly lacking in mainstream horror in 2008.  Of course, your average movie goer/reviewer may say otherwise but to someone who has been watching horror films for over 30 years, I know what scares me and what doesn't.

I finally just watched this sequel last night for the first time and I liked it more than the original actually.  It maintained everything positive from the original while creating a fresh film.  Sure, it's a similar premise, but there was no cat and mouse games for 90 minutes only for the 2 victims to die at the end. This one goes down a whole different way which really sucks the viewer in a way I wasn't prepared for. I liked the family in the sequel way more than the couple with a rocky relationship in the first film.  Now i'm not particularly fond of the teenage angst girl character in most horror films but Bailee Madison did a pretty convincing job in my book of being this melodramatic teenage rebel who gets scared out of her mind.

Even the cinematography in the sequel created a sense of claustrophobia in a wide open trailer park/campground.  I found myself constantly  wanting the camera to pan around the characters because there was a feeling that one of the strangers would be there stalking them.  The only eye rolling I did was during the climax in which sack head seemed impervious to pain akin to Michael Myers.  Other than that, it's a truly suspenseful watch well deserving of more praise amid all of the paranormal/supernatural schlock and gag inducing jump scares that continues to plague mainstream horror cinema to this day.|, Regardless of how this movie actually turns out I gotta say that was a really good trailer especially for a horror movie.|, Just watched it and I need to say this is one of those gems that’s overlooked by many. If you can, watch it! It’s how a true horror movie should be.|, The trailer is so well edited; and so fun to watch on itself. Imagine how amazing the movie will be. I’m so ready for this movie. Watched trailer more than 20 times and been waiting for the movie to have a sequel since the first one came out.|, *comes back 3 years later*
Still my favorite horror film. Love how it gives off the best 80 vibes. Belongs as a part of the 80s horror slasher films|, I want a third Strangers movie! Both were great! Make a prequel!!|, THEY FINALLY MADE A SEQUEL AFTER ALL THESE YEARS|, A prequel would be interesting which explains why Dollface, Pinnup girl and the man in the mask decide to kill and how they meet in the first place.|, i actually thoroughly enjoyed this movie, kinda hoping they make a third one with these two kids and how these events affected them after and what not."

This is a HUGE improvement next to the first Suicide Squad, is exactly what I wanted the first movie to be. Great script, funny jokes, well written character development, amazing screenplay. The mortal-kombat type of deaths were amazing and the last part looked like something out of Lovecraft’s world… James Gunn did an amazing job directing this, definitely worth a watch (in the cinema, if you can)|, Love the fact Harley Quinn is going back into the characters original roots and is embracing the black and red look.|, The bulk of the jokes were shown in this trailer. The actual movie has surprisingly a lot more depth to it and greatly balances action, character development, a decent plot, and amazing visual effects. This is the first DC movie I've seen done right, and I actually enjoyed it :)|, ""I was happy floating , staring at the stars ..""  most heartbreaking line.|, I watched this today and wow it’s absolutely amazing, way better than the first. It had a lot of action and good comedy, it made me laugh a lot. Even some emotional parts too. I give it a 8.5 or even 9/10. And Harley Quinn is amazing I love her, she’s sooo pretty. Margot Robbie is extremely talented, they all are. I definitely wanna watch this movie again|, No one can play Harley Quinn better than Margot Robbie. She is so perfect for this role.|, The Polka Dot guy could have done everything by himself. His polka dots just melt EVERYTHING.|, Never expected myself to say this but it's the most insanely entertaining superhero movie ever made hands down. Oh, James Gunn what a genius you are! Better than any GOTG flick, his twisted vision as a director really helped this to stand out from every superhero movie.

The action set pieces are usually what we've all seen before since the beginning of the 'action genre' but the marvelous thing is he made each action sequence seem brand new due to those subtle twist that he gives to each scene. And the dialogues are written with so much intelligence that it tickles you, angers you and moves you. We can simply say there's a surprise at every turn with this one that no one sees coming which is really a rarity with superhero movies. This one would definitely garner up a strong cult following in years to come. Already feel like watching it again just after finishing, it is that good, trust me 👌👌👌|, Una de mis historias favoritas del universo DC, que bien la plasmaron en la pantalla grande🎉"

Lili = The hustlers
KJ Apa = The last summer 
Camila = The perfect date

The Riverdale cast is separating to make their own movies lmao😂
*mostly romance*|, The thing that annoyed me the most about this movie is that they took away the relationships and connections they make with other people and how they're all connected in some sort of way. The lady in the beginning of the book, the lawyer and etc. Her relationship with her dad is a big deal in the book but we never saw that. They're more to it than them just falling in love and that's why I love the book so much but they never showed that in the movie.|, I honestly love this movie and the story so much. I've both read the book and watched the movie. There's so many things that make me love this story. First of all we see people of two different ethnicities falling in love (which I don't think a lot of movies show, though it's gotten better). This is something that I personally really love since I'm mixed so it's nice seeing people of different ethnicities falling in love and making it normalized. We also see a male character who's emotional and soft. It's also a story about just one day which is so rare for movies, but it really shows the significance of just one day and being in the present which I believe a lot of us tend to forget in modern society. As she is saying in the start of the trailer; ""compared to the lifespan of the universe our lives begin and end in a single day. And then she ends it with; ""all we have is a single day"". In general it's a really beautiful, maybe not perfect, but still beautiful story. It showcases so many great things and both the book and the movie can be recommended. 

I will say this though. I do believe there's some few problems with the movie I do not deny this but it doesn't make me unable to love it. There's some things in the book that's not included here which made it less good than the actual book, but I still think it's worth watching and good entertainment (at least for me because it's totally my kinda thing... 😅🤣).|, As dark skin women when we talk about colourism we are NOT saying that we hate light skinned actresses or that we hate light skinned people, we are saying that we hate feeling underrepresented. We are saying that we hate that our erasure within popular culture makes us feel like we are not good enough when ALL black girls are supposed to be magic. I do believe we are all black no matter if you’re dark skinned, light skinned, medium -whatever. But if that is true then surely we should be represented all shades, all body types, all hair-types. This used to be my favourite book but I’m not sure I can support this film or any other like it until YA adaptation genre changes and soon. It’s going to get left behind because all other genres are changing.|, I can see the sequel now: THE EARTH IS ALSO A PLANET.|, The fact that the *PINK* headphones and the *RED* tie was a big part of the book but they still couldn't do it 🤦‍♀️|, Just me but I wish the headphones were pink like in the book."

No one can play Nick Cage the way Nick Cage can play Nick Cage.|, Finally. A film where Nicolas Cage can show his true talent to the world!|, This movie is so much better than I thought it would be. 
Not only is it Nicholas Cage parodying his exaggerated legend to the max but its so god damn hilarious. 
And the cherry on top is that Pedro Pascal is probably the best thing in it. He was so funny and the chemistry he and Nicolas cage had was perfect. I whole heartedly recommend for fans of nicholas cage and comedy in general.|, Nick cage portraying himself is the most challenging but innovative role he has ever encountered as an actor .this movie looks like a winner!👌|, The idea of this movie wouldn’t work if it was any other actor, but because it’s Nick Cage, somehow, it works. Nobody questions it because it’s a Nick Cage movie, it’s pretty much par for the course at this point. Like, imagine being at the stage in your career where you can quite literally just play yourself in a movie and people will say, “Sure, I’ll watch it.” His movies have transcended normal filmmaking in my opinion, they’ve become their own genre. You’ve got Action, Drama, Comedy, Horror, and Nick freakin’ Cage. And it’s weird, you can’t label Nick Cage movies as simply “good” or “bad.” Even if they’re bad by normal standards, it doesn’t apply to Nick Cage films because they go beyond the normal stigma of filmmaking. A bad movie by normal standards may be an “artistically complex” Nick Cage film, it only further adds to it. In summary, Nick Cage is God.|, Nick cage is an incredible method actor. To spend his entire life in character for this one movie. Amazing.|, Nic Cage holding the golden guns from Face/Off one more time. Fucking Epic! 🙌🏻|, Is this supposed to be a Nick Cage film?

It only really spoils as much as the title does. That being said I would have probably gone with a different title.|, I dont know why but I really enjoy and like mary’s character design and the movies’ poster. it’s a masterpiece and really did this movie justice!|, If someone told me a girl can perform miracles and I witness said girl with eyes as black and hollow as those, I would run away the other way in seconds|, i love jeffrey dean morgan, horror movies, and religious themes/symbolism this is definitely the movie for me i'm so excited|, Finally a promising horror movie.

Different to the original, much more on the comedic side.. brilliantly done, loved every moment of it!|, It should be illegal to make a remake of such incredible movie like Intouchables..|, I've never seen Kevin Heart in anything before, so I didn't know what to expect from this movie.   Kevin was fabulous in this movie, so was everyone in it.  One minute you're laughing and the next minute you feel sad.   I loved hearing  the audience laugh over and over again.  It's rare that I want to see a movie twice, but our family watched it twice.  I'd even watch it again.  We need more movies like this one!|, I didn't knew there was a movie before this and I really loved it so much. I think this movie would be good for people who haven't seen Untouchable yet. This movie is worth it!|, The cast is amaizing but the untouchables in a perfect movie, I didn't imagine it having a remake|, The Untouchable is an excellent movies and I can bear to see such a phenomenal story retold (resold)  A story that reminds us that friendship and what we really need isn't always just next door.  Abdel Sellou and Philippe Pozzo rock!|, Haven't gotten out for entertainment in a long time. I can't wait to see this movie.  I will see this movie with a room full of people, the way comedic movies were meant to be experienced.  Spontaneous group laughter at the good side of Humanity is nourishment for the Soul. Great thanks to all who had a hand in bringing this movie to life.|, Just saw it and have great respect for the actors and actresses in this movie.  Loved it!"

This is a good one!!! This is nowhere near how good the Exorcist is nothing will ever be but it's worth checking out!!! I wasn't expecting all of that!! This was put together really well!!|, I already watched this. Goosebumps 😱|, This is the first time I went to a day one night screening of a movie that didn't even fill the whole auditorium. Weird. This movie was awesomazing|, Totally loved it, first thought was just another Exorcist ""remake"". Which I gave up hope for decades ago. This one really got it right. I certainly see this as equal to the Exorcist, but with a different angle to it. We highly recommend it!|, Great movie!!! I hope there’s more to come! 🙌🏽|, This movie could have been made a bit longer nd more scary but it was a good effort . Worth a watch 👍🏾|, This movie was excellent. I really hope there is a second, can't wait|, Im gonna see this just support Pena, one of the most underrated actors alive|, In my opinion this was the best horror film I have ever seen"

What a performance , this guy should be recognised more 💪🏼|, Growing up Boro Park, and as a mechanic, having several Hasid customers, I enjoyed this movie. Jewish Horror is actually a pretty strong, fresh genre'|, A strong and underrated horror film with a creepy vibe and lots of very effective scares! Can't believe I'd never heard of this before, I found it on Hulu and was pleasantly surprised. The monster as metaphor for religious trauma gives it a bit more depth than the average PG-13 haunted house movie.|, Una de las mejores películas que he visto , una referencia a dejar ir y perdonarse a si mismos. 👏👏👏|, Very good movie. It's somber and quiet, but I loved learning about the ritual and it's. Meaning. It had scary parts and his guilt over the little boy really got to me. I believe that this is true. Some negative entities you pick them up anywhere and they attach themselves to you.|, One of the most original horror films of recent times.One that scares & connects emotionally as well.|, Very good movie.

That may just be the greatest line from any horror movie ever.|, ""Would you mind getting in the oven for me?""

That was the one line that made my mom be like, ""Yep, we're going to see this movie. Put your coats on.""|, One of my all-time favorites -- love this movie! The part where the boy is outside running with his hands behind his back like the old lady had me in tears laughing!|, To me, the scares in this movie were set up quite well, because they did a great job emphasizing the sheer unpredictability of the grandma and hence played on our fear of the unknown. It kept me on edge for much of the movie, as I never knew what the grandma would do next. Even though ""The Visit"" may not have been a great movie, I personally rank it higher than a lot of ghost movies (even including ""The Conjuring"" and ""Lights out"") in terms of scares.|, Just watched this movie. Absolutely loved it, the plot twist was actually good, and the scenes clearly conveyed what they wanted to.|, I honestly expected the ending but how it was revealed is truly amazing! This movie is really great.. Few dull moments but it's worth it! :)|, if I open a door and see someone scratching the door like that...the window would make the best exit|, i don't really get why the hate comments on this film. i actually think it's quite good. it's kinda slow in the beginning but it gets pretty intense later on. also, the combination of comedy and horror in this film is very refreshing.|, Got to see this movie early at VidCon this year and I was surprised by how genuinely scary it was. Really scary movie and a really interesting story too 😱 I can't wait to see it again in theaters! I definitely recommend this one!

The Wailing,The Wailing Official Trailer 2 (2016) - Korean Thriller HD,VUWAgbXSJ4Y,930791,4811,390,"This is a masterpiece , deeply unsettling and extremely well crafted film making. Left me three days of sleepless nights , probably one the best horror without any jump scares or cliche gimmicks. The director's filmography is filled with these strange enigma that encircles you and leaves you disturbed once viewed.|, I've watched this movie half a dozen times and every so often I watch it again and every single time I notice new details that I didn't realize were there previously. This is one of the best supernatural thrillers of all time hands down.|, You know it's a good movie when you already get the chills with only the trailer!|, This is going down as one of my favorite horror movies of all time. Absolute brilliant. Hollywood!! Take a look at this. This movie deserves multiple awards.|, Such a great film. Truly underrated. Funny, suspenseful, non-political and great scenic shots. Gave me a glimpse into their world and cultural beliefs that have been heavily sheltered for so long. Beautiful. 8/10.|, This movie kept me guessing all throughout up until its end actually. Korean movies especially horror,thriller, and crime never fails to deliver flawless plot. This movie made me love it because the plot seemed really disturbing I almost hate it for keeping me thinking even after credit rolls.|, I loved this movie so much, it was really disturbing but at the same time the story constantly kept me interested , I think it's my favorite horror movie|, This is one of the best Korean Horror movies I ever saw. I put it right up there with Tale of Two Sisters. It's incredible. 9.5/10 from me.|, I haven’t had a horror get under my skin like this in a very, very long time. I’d equate this to South Korea’s version of The Exorcist with a pinch of Evil Dead. A brilliant look into how a filmmaker can orchestrate terror.|, Hands Down.

The Walk,Walking Across the World Trade Center Gap | The Walk (2015) | Now Playing,oaC8VdRgP0g,1031836,9189,1617,"I watched the original documentary of Philippe Petit. He spent 45 minutes on the wire and made 8 trips from one building to the other. I remember his comment that it was no more dangerous to walk across the towers than it was to walk across a wire at 8 floors off the ground. If you fall, the result will be the same anyway.|, Can’t believe they rebuilt them just for this movie. So amazing.|, “Now the towers are gone. But in memory, as if imprinted on the sky, the towers are still there. And part of that memory is the joyful morning, August 7, 1974, when Philippe Petit walked between them in the air”

-The Man Who Walked Between The Towers|, This movie took some serious artistic license with the police actions that day.
Not a single cop leaned out to grab him.
They knew any action on their part might cause him to fall. They opted for the safest action and that was to let him finish on his own.|, You know what’s amazing? Phillppe petit actually helped glorify and popularize the World Trade Center and gave them much needed attention|, Nobody can replicate the courage and dedication this man had|, That scene when he threw the pole up and did a front flip and a backflip before he caught the pole was stunning.|, I remember we studied this feat in primary school, and after one of our teacher emailed Philippe, we got a response. Truly a memorable moment of my childhood.|, Doing something like this takes courage and Petit really had A LOT of it! He's not the only daredevil to do something big like this involving the Twin Towers. In 1983, Dan Goodwin CLIMBED all the way to the top of the North Tower using suction cups. And in the 1970's, a daredevil jumped off the South Tower with a parachute and in 1990's, another daredevil did the same thing. They all survived uninjured. They were arrested but the owners and people in charge of the towers did not press charges because no damage was done and nobody was hurt and plus it was great publicity for the towers. So they all got off with paying a small fine.|, 1:14-1:34  

“Bravery is not the absence of fear. Bravery is feeling the fear, the doubt, the insecurity and deciding that something else is more important”

That part is my favourite moment, the real feat was beyond unbelievable, incredible and absolutely breathtaking. It will never be attempted again. I mean holding a record that can never be broken is probably one of the most legendary things you can ever have to your name"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4no36RMWFME|, The transition from empty spaces to young lust  is fucking incredible|, This is probably me just tossing my comment into the void but this album means so much to me. The themes of isolation I relate to so much. And the end message of Outside The Wall gives me the most hopeful happiness I've ever had from an album. I love the message that track says of time are going to get hard but you won't be able to get the help you need from the people who love you if you don't tear down the wall. It's a simple but powerful message. As much of an old fuck as I sound I wish people in this newer generation would sit down and experience this album and soak in the message. If anyone ever sees this thank you for reading this. I've never really had anyone to share my thoughts and feelings of the things I truly love so just knowing someone read my thoughts from my fucked up brain makes me happy. Have a good day or evening|, Perhaps 100 years from now 15 year old children will listen to this for the first time and be as mesmerized as I was back in 1980.  This is a work of art.|, Escucharlo en LP es increíble un viaje a otra dimensión!!!|, This Album never gets old.  I like it more today than when I bought it in 1979.|, Growing up my pops showed me Pink Floyd and The Wall movie. till this day and I remember even being 7 years old asking my dad what these songs mean and they’ve stuck with me, always that album I go back to when it pops up in my head. My favorites being Mother and Goodbye Blue Sky. Also I love the start to In the Flesh. Even songs off the album like Brain Damage and Money still stick with me. Growing up we actually had the Echoes of Pampe (Cover band for Pink Floyd) come and play every year during the summer and It was always great. All the noises just do something to your brain, make you feel uneasy, then also in it at the same time, feeling the pain of the story of whether you relate to it or not, or even just questioning what the hell is happening. I’m grateful my parents showed me Pink Floyd.|, This double album was released a few months after my father committed suicide. I was 15 and this album helped me through life from that moment.|, This album changed my life when I was in 6th grade. My parents were WW2 babies in England. I sorta felt like this album helped me understand them and myself more.  War is horrific and does intergenerational damage.|, Still to this day this album moves me to tears!!"

The concept is so moving.|, Absolutely worth to watch,great sci-fi, a group of people in a community with a shared mankind's future, who choose to work hard no matter how struggling they are,to sacrifice themselves when needed, eventually retain the values they want to keep, and continue a more resilient civilization for all humankinds - ''in time of crisis,duties above all'', great value,great spirit,a really touching one|, Andy Lau killed it in this movie. The mid-credits scene is better than any Marvel post credit scene. Cannot wait for Wandering Earth 3 to come out.|, Impeccable production, great visuals, and CGIs on Earth, the moon, and huge explosions. A classic sci-fi movie with many references to Odyssey 2001:Space Odyssey, The Meteor (1979), or Harmagedon (1998). You won't be surprised that in the movie's world order, the Western world seems so disorganized and subject to violence while China shows strong discipline and a leading edge.|, You don't know how much I love the first movie, Can't believe they made a sequence 😍|, A three hours (173mins) movie that did not feel like 3 hrs when you were glued to the epic story and presentation.|, I drove 2 hours for watch this movie(1 and 2),both are definitely best movies I've watched in my entire life. This movie is incredible no matter on Special effect, story telling or plot of a play. Definitely the movie you will not regret to watch. 100% recommand and 100% will rewatch agian|, Unlike other films, this film does not emphasize how great a particular country（for example China)or a particular man is, but more about how people from different countries unite to cope with big crises. I have watched it and got a lot of inspiration. Humans need to unite to survive in this universe。

Bobby D's performance as the titular ""grandpa"" is absolutely stellar, him and the boy really convey the idea of ""old-school vs. new-cool""! If you're looking for a real time-killer flick, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not checking out ""War With Grandpa"". Just make sure to warn your family beforehand about the numerous violent WWII flashback scenes.

5/5|, I love the scene where the grandfather is having a seizure after being bitten by the deadly snake and the boy just looms silently over him, expression cold and curious, all the while doing cool Tiktok vape tricks.|, A total family entertainer!|, This movie is a total family entertainer. I enjoyed how time continued its linear flow.|, It's entertaining. Just finished it. 
DeNiro,  Walkens, and Cheech are basically their normal comedy selves.  
And of course, Uma is always perfect to watch.  
I would really really love to see a wholesome fun comedy or drama (either way) with Uma, Ethan, and Maya as an actual family. It would be awesome.|, This actually looks like it would fun to watch, I’m down for this. 
It’s been a while since a good wholesome film with little stakes came out|, This really looks like a Total Family Entertainer!|, I got emotional when the McElroys said I could go to war with my found grandpa! I think I will watch this movie now!|, Here we go! I love how Robert Di Nero has become our quintessential grumpy but still fun grandpa. This film looks fun and possibly sentimental with the grandfather and grandson understanding each other after all of the antics. Stay safe everyone!|, this might be one of De Niro's happiest movies I wish to see.  it almost reminds me of my childhood with my grandpa."
The Water Diviner,The Water Diviner Official Trailer #1 (2014) Russell Crowe Australian Epic Movie HD,8CkLC4Zr2Mw,4638896,8639,1225,"The trailer was very touching. Well done to Russell Crowe. As someone who was born in Turkey and currently living in Australia as a proud Australian citizen. I would like to say rest in peace to all the Australian and Turkish soldiers who died in Gelibolu. All Australians please understand when we say this from the depths of our hearts. YOUR SONS ARE NOW OUR SONS AS WELL. 5 stars and Helal Olsun Mr. Crowe |, I saw this movie yesterday in the cinema. Best. Movie. Ever. It was so touching and even the supporting actors were really good! Edward and Henry's deaths were very depressing, and the movie makes us realize how devastating it is to have a loved one die in such a condition. I recommend everyone to watch this movie.|, This was such a good movie. I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!!!! Its been weird for me to watch it because my father is Turkish and my moms Australian. But I liked it so much. I cried, laughed (mostly cried) and enjoyed every second of it. Good on you Russell Crowe! One of the best movies he ever made. |, An amazing film! I would recommend it to everyone! Not the usual Hollywood film, you won't regret watching it! Very heart-felt. Made me cry at times |, This movie was very profound for me...the futility & dehumanization of wars, the connections made despite cultural differences, the beauty of a man-made construct (the blue mosque), the possible/potential psychic connections between those we love & their experiences....loved this movie|, gerçekten güzel bir film
ben bir türküm ve böyle birinin bizim tarihimizle ilgilenmesi cidden güzel bir duygu.|, Excellent movie highlights the struggles, hardships, pain, perseverance, and hope of the main actor in finding his sons. During his journey he finds new found love and begins to understand the tragedy of war, not only from his side but from the other side as well. Movie teaches you that war is costly on all sides and brings pain and suffering to families even after the last bullet was fired.|, The best anti-war film I've seen in years. The money I spent on the ticket was definitely worth it.|, The wonderful things about movies is that they can make us feel good, bad, happy, sad, and because it is a movie it only has to be between you and the screen.  This movie is about family and promises we make to keep our family close - it's about the love between husband and wife of their sons and how he takes on a mission he is constantly pushed back from.  No one wants him there, yet he is determined to find his sons...and if you watch it, it has an incredible ending!|, I had to watch this for class, and I'm so glad that I did for many reasons. It shows the Turkish side (which isn't something I ever learnt when it came to WW1) and it shows the devastation of war, and what it does to families. When I was asked what I'd rate this move out of ten, I said 9.9 - the 0.1 was because I almost cried in front of everyone, and my class is the kind of class to never let that go and make fun of you for it."

Straight felt that so hard|, Looks like he acted his heart out for this. Hope he bounces back with this one.|, As someone who is sitting in Ben’s characters position, he perfectly encapsulates how it feels. Everyone who asks you how you are, you always say you’re fine, you spend your boring nights just drinking, at the bar or at home wasting away. Family becomes a second thought, something you ignore so often even though you care about them so much. This film is therapy and I thank the creators for what they have done for those who are struggling and need something to relate to when nothing else seems to work.|, Damn- this movie really mirrors Ben’s life. He looks like he really put his heart to this. Hopefully this movie is gonna be good.|, Powerful movie. Two days sober here after losing everything. Just watched this for my first time. I cried.|, This seem like a personal / self-therapy for Ben. It gonna be a terrific performance.|, Going to miss him as Batfleck, but looking forward to seeing this.|, What a film this is honestly had me crying, the performance by Ben Affleck is something else especially as you realise the struggles with alcohol he was going through at the time it just makes his performance that more special. I come from a family where we for generations have struggled with addiction and the addiction part of the film really hits home and has opened my eyes to a problem I have been ignoring for to long. The part of the storyline about his son is so upsetting as I have sons myself and it just makes you want to cherish every moment life gives you with your kids. Sad but absolutely brilliant film.|, You have no idea the pressures of true Faith. I saw no flaws in this movie.. Knowing Affleck’s issues in the past, just to see him finish this movie was inspirational. In life those that use alcohol and drugs as a crutch is what most of us do. We’re in it together. As winners we we support those in need but especially ourselves."

The ending always gets me so emotional. It’s crazy how just 1 person can literally change your life.|, Everyone's commenting about how good Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell did in this movie but no one's commenting about how good the lead player was. He really got into the character. So lonely and uncomfortable and quiet. Exactly what it's like to be a teen on vacation with people whom you don't like and being treated like a little baby. Very underrated! One of my favorite coming of age stories.|, I honestly didnt expect this to be one of my favorite movies of all time|, I watched this movie multiple times throughout my teenage years. As a very awkward, shy teen, I could relate to the main character. Now I've watched it for the first time as a young adult, I still love the movie, but now I can see through a different point of view.

It's one of my comfort films. I love the script, the setting and most of all, the characters. It has a very simple premise, nothing complex. But I think almost anyone could relate to the story, the awkwardness of trying to belong and the sadness of growing up while trying to find a sense of identity and stability.|, the message of this movie was incredibly simple but important: surround yourself with good people.|, I had tears in my eyes at the end of the film. Doesn't happen often with me. Great story. Great actors. Great film.|, The relationship between Sam Rockwell's character and Liam James' character is one of the coolest ones I've seen in film. Both actors knocked it out of the park.|, This movie was really good. Great lines, great script; I was surprised it's not adapted from a book. The setting and even the title sounds like it's from a book. I don't know what I was expecting but the movie made me feel really warm and fuzzy and I find myself wanting to wish the characters the best of luck at the end and hope they will be happy in life.|, I can't stress enough how I love this movie! I love it so much. Hits close to home. When parents separates, the kids will suffer. Make friends with someone who will bring out the best in you.|, This is a fantastic movie! Yes, it's really funny, but the trailer almost makes it look like a goofball comedy. It is not. It is one of the most touching, most endearing films I have ever seen. This is a classic. I hope enough people continue to discover it so that it goes down in cinema history as the great movie it deserves to be."

He plays tough guys with the sensitive side to perfection (I suspect he is just this way in real life).

I gotta watch this movie bc I don’t think a trailer has made me cry the way this one has.|, Congrats on the Oscar Brendan!   You deserved everything you received!  Thank you for your performance.  You are loved|, I just finished this movie and I cried so much after it was over. It takes you somewhere. It's bleak but not in a bad way, it's not commercial, it wouldn't be everyone's cups of tea but it's honest, raw and so damn deep!! I'm so glad that Brandon frazier is back, he deserves the world!|, Believe the hype. I’m an action and comedy guy. The wife asked me to watch it with her and I begrudgingly said yes, as I’am cheering for Brendan Fraser. This film and a number of performances within it, are outstanding. Completely exceeded my expectations and my wife’s. The Oscars are a joke, and regardless if this film doesn’t take home multiple awards, it is my new favourite film.|, I came back to watch this again now that Brendan has officially WON HIS OSCAR FOR BEST ACTOR!!! Im legit so happy i actually choked up seeing him accept his award! he deserved it for this role! WE LOVE YOU BRENDAN CONGRATS!!!|, “I need to know I did ONE THING RIGHT WITH MY LIFE!‬”

‪Something about the way Brendan Fraser delivers this line just hits you right in the heart. I’m not ready for this to emotional break me. Brendan Fraser is WINNING that Oscar. ‬|, Finally watched this movie and i loved it amazing movie brendon  acting was incredible 🙏❤️‍🔥|, I finally watched this last weekend.... There are nearly enough words to describe Brendon Fraser's performance. I haven't been this drawn into a character's emotional journey since American Beauty. If you haven't seen it yet, please carve out the time to do so. If you are truly into the cinematic experience of movie making and watching.

The Wind Rises,The Wind Rises - Official Trailer,RzSpDgiF5y8,461518,6016,117,"When it said ""Farewell Masterpiece,"" I think a part of me died. We love you. Miyazaki! Don't leave us too long, Ghibli Studios!|, This is still my favorite Ghibli Movie even after many years. Watch it a couple of times already but still have the same emotions. Such a masterpiece.|, This movie, although not miyazaki's last as we thought, still is one of the best of the ghibli catalogue. The beauty of every scene is amazing, and the simplicity of the story is its strongest point. 

Of course, it wasn't well recieved by the united states because of the simple fact that it portrays the war from another angle. I've read people calling it morally repulsive, wich is complete bullshit: Jiro doesn't design planes made to kill people, he designs planes because he thinks they're beautiful. 

And we see many signs within the movie that point out the awfulness of war. Miyazaki is completely against war from both the ""good"" and the ""bad side"", and if you've seen his movies, you know that: he doesn't side with anyone, he simply tells a story of good people who have the bad luck to be stuck in war, and these people aren't bad for being on the opposite side of war, they're simply people, because in war, there's no bad people, just people who follow orders from individuals with too much power. 

Calling this movie morally repulsive would be like calling a documentary about the ""Manhattan project"" disgusting propaganda about brutal homicide, or also calling The Grave of the Fireflies morally repulsive, just because these kids happened to be japanese and deserved to suffer for their leaders.|, This trailer will always give me goosebumps like it is doing currently. 
Kinda funny to the editor who worked their butt off to make this, saying it's the farewell masterpiece, when here we are nine years later and Miyazaki got pulled into doing oooonnneee more. His talent and the talent of this crew is unmatched though.|, This movie has a very special place in my heart, as a lover of engineering and the art within it (the story also broke my heart)|, Miyazaki-sama: You will be missed; the beauty you showed us, the one that lingers in the human heart, will outlive you. thank you.|, This looks incredible... I will miss Miyazaki's films :')|, I've always loved these kinds of coming-of-age stories about real people who overcome struggles and do great things, because they are extremely personifying and will always give you relatable moments. I promise you, these stories are occurring right now everywhere in the world. Even to you, dear YouTube commenters: Look back to your childhood and reflect on events around you. The good ones, the bad ones, the inspiring ones, and downright evil ones. They made you who you are, but as an adult you must strive to bring it to its full potential.


For example, this reminds me of my little brother. We grew up in a large town in the middle of the rolling green mountains. When I was a young boy, we moved to one of the few flat places in the valleys of our region when he was just starting to speak, so naturally there was an airport with some regional flights. Sure enough, my brother is becoming a pilot, and I fear if war is really ahead of us with the other world superpower, he will be one of the first to be drafted.|, I mean lots of anime studios will come and go but there's no one who can match the animation level like Ghibli gives to us ❤|, The trailers enough to leave you in tears. The films enough to leave you sobbing."

They are creative in their story telling and I know many of us can appreciate that.|, This is what horror should be. No jump scares, just disturbing horrific content. Not like that cookie cutter BS hollywood has been force feeding us lately. 10/10|, This is very historical, when a person back in the 1600's felt that there was a witch or demon upon them, they would go through all of these risks. Blaming their friends and family for the paranormal happenings because they didn't want it to be true. I applaud the writers.|, The people who are saying this movie was horrible don’t realize that horror doesn’t mean scary, horror is being disturbed, not being scared. You don’t need to have jump scares to make a horror movie.|, One of the best films I've ever seen. So original, and Anya's debut was astonishing.|, The ability to make a disturbing film without a single jumpscare is just....wow...|, “For me, good horror is taking a look at what’s actually dark in humanity, instead of shining a quick flashlight on it and running away giggling"" - Robert Eggers|, I really loved that Eggers used natural sunlight for the day scenes, and only natural fire light for the night. It makes it look more realistic for the time this story was narrated. No doubt Robert Eggers is a great director!|, “Hereditary” owes its lineage to this film. Both “Hereditary” and “The Witch” are masterpieces.|, This movie was a masterpiece, from its rich historical accuracy, its old English dialogue , to what the director shows you or allows to be seen and what’s left up to the imagination… this film impacted me when it came out , it’s hopeful that Hollywood still has a few real artists working in the industry"

Funy af too.|, I can’t say how much I truly love this movie enough. Seriously. It’s great.|, It's Fargo-esque in its true focus being the individual characters and how their personality quirks and weaknesses affect the horrific events a small rural community is completely unprepared for.  Fantastic fresh angle on horror.  Went straight into the collection.|, yes haven't seen a good werewolf flick in over a decade! this  movie was so different and instant classic! didn't expect the comedy parts to work so well with serious and dark parts. and yet nothing was cheesy it just great movie and atmosphere! and really unexpected twist. Jim Cummings was awesome in his role I had no idea he is also writer and director too. super talented guy!|, This was an exceptional movie! I know next to nothing about Jim Cummings but his writing, directing, and acting in this was such a breath of fresh air. THUMBS UP and Robert Forster deserves a posthumous best supporting actor nod for this too.|, This was fairly good. Better than I expected. Robert Forster has been in hundreds of movies & TV shows...Never disappoints.
And with Riki Lindhome as the Deputy...it was even better. She has a comedic aura about her, which makes her likable. 
I think she is quite underrated. Saw her first in The Big Bang Theory...and became a instant fan.
This was very entertaining...with a good twist at the end. The FX was not all that bad either.|, Just got done watching it. The sheriff John was phenomenal! He cracked me up (it takes a lot for me to make me laugh!) Great acting and great movie 🙌🏻🙌🏻|, Just seen this, it was pretty damn good. The ending was great. Jim Cummings nailed it. R.I.P.

His grunts are epic and he is great at playing these super tough, tough-love badasses that you almost mistake for villains.|, If Wolverine didn't have superpowers he actually died 4 times in the fight. Sanada Hiroyuki is awesome❤️|, Hiroyuki Sanada fights like a man in his 20s or 30s. And his performance in MK is simply electric.|, When Wolverine was in his prime and his healing wasn’t slow at all 😭|, Nobody can replace the role of Logan/Wolverine from Hugh Jackman. I mean LITERALLY no one|, Why was this guy a more interesting adversary to Wolverine than the actual Silver Samurai?|, The music is incredible, the lighting is incredible, Hugh and Sanada are incredible and this scene is incredible.

So stunning and brave. I had both tears and gas.|, I love the scene where she didn’t want to give up slavery .So brave & Stunning|, I loved the part where the Woman King said "" If he's dead, he's dead "" so inspiring|, The most exceptional female warrior from a society which captured and enslaved other black people. What a role model! I had tears in my eyes just from watching this trailer. That part where she kicked Sauron into the sarlacc pit, screaming ""This is Tortuga!"" was the greatest and the most empowering moment in the history of filmmaking!
11 out of 10 members of the Ministry of truth reccommend this movie!|, Based on a story just as true as the 99% audience rating|, When she shouted to her warriors: ""This is sponsored by NordVPN"" - that was sooo inspiring and brave!|, When she yelled angrily ""We will never let white old men take away our slave raids"", I felt deeply touched.

I already love NYC – proud & thankful to call it home, but wow.. this gave me a whole new appreciation for where I live ❤️🏙️🗽 So much beauty!!|, I used to read his blog many years ago.  He was sort of exploring the city walking for hours and hours and giving reports with photos and some interesting stories or blurbs. It was like 3 to 6 photos a day.  He took great photos with his phone.  And we were taking the journey with him without so much time or effort as he put into it. Really it was a travel log about the city history, sometimes obscure interesting history and the markers he found of that history.  It was not so much about him. It was not so much about any people he met along the way.  I can't believe he is not finished yet, some things take longer than you think they will.|, Makes monolithic New York look a little more tangible and hospitable. Can't wait to see in November :–)|, I been doing something similar daily for over 10 years in Montreal, camera on my back, spring, summer, fall, winter, sub zero cold, wind, rain, snow,  heatwave. Selective in my choice of locations, I average between 200 to 230 km per month,  documenting moments in time that interest me in the most fascinating parts of my city. I often repeat locations hoping my visit will be more interesting than my last. The pics and vids of Montreal are adding up in TB storage. No selfies. it's not about me but what I see. www.instagram.com/vikingdescendent/?hl=en|, I moved to NYC 18 years ago, simply because I always loved it and decided I wanted to live here.  I saw this film the other night, and imho it perfectly captured all that makes NYC so great... esp. its people!...the diversity of the population here...and how open so many NYers are...  if they see you with a movie camera, like many people, they become curious...and many NYers love nothing more than to give you their opinion...to be on camera, etc.


What I also loved about this film was that you also saw the varied physical aspects that make up NYC and its five boroughs.  You see skyscrapers...outer borough neighborhoods with a variety of housing stock....you see public parks.... wetlands along the shoreline.... industrial areas....remote areas.... massive cemeteries with a highway right above or beside them...  


A really well-done film!


Question for the film-makers.... at least in this preview clip, is it possible I saw a shot of the cemetery located on the grounds of the Lent-Riker Smith Homestead in Elmhurst?  It's too bad a mention of that famous house didn't make it into the movie...|, The old man's laugh between 1:14 to 1:20 is precious."

Their films together are always wonderful!|, Love this movie|, The thing I loved about this movie was not just the humor, but the messages this film conveyed. One of them being about the flaws of humanity|, Just come back from seeing this movie. Great film, amazing work with Simon, Nick, Martin and everyone else involved. Was laughing all the way through, and some brilliant fight scenes as well.|, The movie is so much better if you didn't watch the trailer first.|, brilliant film!

The Worst Person in the World,The Worst Person In The World - Official Teaser,55M5ZgAqbWo,1310911,13469,601,"I am at a point in my life, where everything is confusing and scary, while I still long to just exist and experience every day as it comes, without any big expectations (even though that's what society wants from me/us all - to stress about things that don't even matter). This movie felt like talking to a good friend, being understood, and gave positive energy to go on in life and just exist. 
Watch it!|, I love that romance movies are going through a renaissance. The cloying sentimentality and shameless manipulation of yesterdays is repalced with full-bodies characters grappling with real, existential issues. People in modern romantic movies feel real. Their flaws are real, their feelings are real and above all, their charisma is real. Which is why we respond so strongly to them. I haven't been able to get The Souvenir out of my head yet. This looks and feels equally good.|, It would be nice if they'd just release this film already. I hate the way they hype these indie films early in the year when they're at the festivals and then hold on to them until, eventually, no one cares and hype has died down. And yes, I know it has to do with the film getting distribution at the festivals but the system is broken...|, Just added to one of my favorite movies list. Watching it as a 24 year old woman, this movie was reassuring in a way. It’s realistic and melancholic but at the same time it felt like a breath of fresh air.|, One of the most life-changing movie experiences I've had in a long time <3 So elated to have seen this in the cinema.|, One of the most amazing movie going experiences I’ve had in genuinely years, I loved it so much|, Renate Reinsve truly deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. She was phenomenal.|, Mesmerizing movie which left me stunned and crying. Partially because there are certain links to my offline, not distorted by creative online writing, biography, partially because it's so intrinsically Scandinavian and nobody depicts emotions so deeply and thruthfully as Scandinavians, be it writers or filmmakers. This is a heavy-hitter, if you're an emotional person like me, it might even become a life gamechanger.

The closest movie, thematically, not plot-wise one could imagine is Lost in Translation, albeit as an American movie it LiT is much shallower, but both movies are about conflicting emotions.

I am still trembling, also because the movie is roughly 60% about me, but it is the first time I have seen a movie where female protagonist reproduces thoughts and facts from my bio (and probably other males). As a multipolar and omnisexual person I love when certain issues are being brought to life and even shine so brightly, even if it will sink into mass audience much much later.

Gem, not a movie.|, I saw this in a pre premiere in Oslo, and it was amazing. Really excited for this getting US distribution and more people being able to see this soon.|, I was in Oslo 5 days ago, it was my first day in this city. Walking and listening music, enjoying this moment, I saw her. 
I looked at her, she looked at me, as if she knew I understood who she was. I don’t know what I felt at that moment, it was amazing."
The Wretched,THE WRETCHED Trailer (2020),PkyHLudSrCE,2193610,17500,1076,"Great movie. Great storytelling. The concept it’s not that new, but it’s well presented and written. No jump scares. Suspense all the time like “what’s going to happen?”. An easy 8/10.|, I watch almost every horror movie that comes out.This might be the only one you see all year that’s unique & actually scary. 35 years dedicated to horror if that matters to anyone. Watch this film!|, Loved the movie. A good horror watch after really a long time. From the start to end really interesting and not boring at all. A good horror movie I repeat.|, When the movie with a budget of less than 100k is still better than 90% of horror movies|, It's a fun movie. For some reason I get the vibe it might be more so for pre teens and early teens. I definitely would have loved it when I was a kid, maybe because it reminds me of hocus pocus a lil, only a whole lot more more graphic haha|, Just watched this little gem on Hulu...all I can say is it's been a while since I've actually found something worth watching..these guys are doing great things hopefully they will be making more of these thrillers..first thought coming on was yes finally a movie without a close up of scared faces just because your keys are out of place..this movie didn't have to (try) and make you scared it was perfect.|, I liked this movie.  Did not see the usual tropes that cheese ball scary movies have nowadays.  Solid directing and acting as well as kick ass practical effects!  These filmmakers are big time fans of Sam Raimi.  A master of horror in his own right.  Enjoy!!  Rei Gunn 2, the music is meant to be unsettling.  it's sometimes dissonant and that gives an eerier overall mood!|, Its a great horror movie yes it is meant for a  teenage audience but you have to be able to tell that from the trailer I loved every minute of the movie all the way up to the ending . I would give the movie five stars if you could rate it like that on here.|, I just finished watching this movie with a friend. It is one of the better horror movies I've seen recently. Surprised myself that I wasn't wishing for the characters to be killed off.|, Decent movie. Kid gets a summer job by the sea. Girls, friends, family issues and weird neighbours.

—The incredible or unexplainable story of young Jesus
—At the young aged, He already made interaction with His Father and done many unknown miracles
—Show mercy on the oppressed
—Luci (Satan) is not sure who really Jesus is until He come to aged
—Romans' interaction with the young Jesus
—A caring family show care for a boy they didn't know and they have no idea that it was the Messiah
—How Jesus weep for the innocent souls that was murdered in Bethlehem by a mad king
—The wisdom and healing He shared
—The Centurion and the young Messiah's interaction
—How the Son of God & the Prince of Peace trampled the influence of the Emperor of Hell & Prince of Lies
—Mary reveal's Jesus' birth by the Archangel Gabriel
—Jesus Christ's reflection of everything 
—And lastly, the Holy Trinity.|, Extraordinary film, for  what things we knew not of the child Messiah, or perhaps only in part....it has come to have portrayed through a beautiful film. Applause to the production and the cast, Bravo! More than words could express it is sublime. Godspeed.|, Very beautiful movie.. tears keep rolling watching the precious moments of our Lord and Savior|, Thank you for uploading the movie. Jesus Christ has changed the world.

Update 2021: even after all these years this movie still moves me...
Ps they don't really show the animals getting killed, they cut to the scene. So people can stop complaining.|, Wow what a must see movie. This was a great way to teach our 3 girls about what happened during the war and learn about the heroes who helped save lives. So moving...|, I hope she gets nominated for an Oscar and finally wins it... she deserved it so many times before . Amazing actress|, Just watched it. It was a phenomenal film. So pure, heartbreaking, and inspiring.|, This movie looks absolutely amazing, beautiful, & yet sad.

What an actor, the looks in his eyes.|, I feel like people need to be reminded of these past events, especially taking into consideration the direction in which the world seems determined to head down. Beautiful trailer, I'm definitely going to watch this one.|, I thought this whole movie was going to be how this lady and her family rescued animals  and hid her their own zoo animals but it was a great movie 🎥 and that’s amazing what she and her family had done !! ♥️♥️|, When the little boy raised his hands 0:51,  the innocence yet to be lost, my heart tore into pieces💔💔|, I have read the book and I cannot wait to see this movie. Jessica Chastain should win an Oscar already. She is one of the most versatile actress of today."
Theater Camp,THEATER CAMP | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures,puVDIUk0kM8,4039583,16097,516,"This was filmed at my actual camp, which unfortunately closed.

I'm so glad Kutz is preserved forever!|, The cast is made up of extremely talented and underrated actors, wow!|, As someone who went to theatre camp in their youth, then onto drama school, this looks incredible 😂|, That first bit with the secret to getting the kids attention is 100% accurate.  The exact thing happened when I was a counselor at summer camp -- we had a couple of different call and response methods for getting the kids attention that I was familiar with but the new art director wasn't.  He was unsuccessfully trying to get their attention, then I dropped in with the call and response gag and they were all focused.  The new art director was like 'what was that?'|, I watched this movie in theaters recently and it was honestly one of the best things I’ve ever seen, as a theater kid this is the best representation of my theater experiences and the movie honestly made me cry, the atmosphere and people you would meet have been perfectly captured and I am honestly so sad that more people aren’t talking about it.|, Saw it at Sundance. This movie feels like it was made specifically for me. And yet like it could have wide appeal. I can’t wait to see it again.|, One of the most fun movies in quite a while! It’s not just fun but filled with hearts. Also shout out to the kid that delivered “that doesn’t look okay” line, it’s honestly gold! 1:51|, If this group of actors were a friend group I’d want to be in this friend group so badly|, This looks amazing! And “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin” is one of my favorite show tunes, so if someone started singing that around me I would definitely join in like the kids did 😂😂|, just saw this at a mystery movie night, and it was incredible!! it was a total love letter/hate mail and completely hilarious. the entire audience burst into raucous laughter multiple times. 5 stars! the entire cast did an amazing job and it was a sincere love letter to theater and the arts, and made me think lovingly and cringely at my own time at orchestra camp as a youth."

It’s so visceral. With the soundtrack, unbelievably unique plot, amazing actors, and visuals. It’s truly a film that everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime. I can assure you it has the happiest of endings and it’s a beautiful one! There is so much symbolism and metaphors that it’s quite enlightening. Incredible international film, definitely recommend watching it!!|, I loved this movie! The soundtrack is amazing and the chemistry between Thelma and Anja is great! Anyone who hasn’t watched it yet, give it a watch! It also makes me want to visit Norway|, This was SO good!!!! I believe the genres within the movie aren't usually used together, but Thelma KILLED IT with lesbianism, telekinetic superpower stuff, a decent amount of disturbing scariness... everything! I really really loved it and am looking for more movies like this... great job everyone!|, I am so extremely here for this. Trier is a brilliant director and this looks totally subversive and a change of pace for him.

They Shall Not Grow Old,They Shall Not Grow Old – New Trailer – Now Playing In Theaters,IrabKK9Bhds,8176185,138541,9423,"I can’t imagine being 15, 16, 17 years old and going into war. I remember when I was 15 and just finishing 8th grade and transitioning into highschool and thinking my preteen angst was a big deal. It really hit home watching these young men doing this out of a sense of patriotic duty and like they said “giving up their youth to do a job that needed to be done”|, My grandfather served on the German side from 1915-1918. He was court martialled to serve as Stormtrooper because he punched an arrogant officer in the face (called the soldiers coming from the frontline stinking pigs). He was burried alive in a bunker by a close artillery impact, wounded 7 times, labelled a ""hopeless case"" once and left in the dying-ward. He made it. Later in WW2 he was conscripted as officer, to command a POW camp. When it was liberated by the Soviets, they wanted to shoot him for being a POW camp commander. The allied soldiers protected him, saying he treated them good. He returned to civilian life and died age 81.
I am amazed by this man, by his strenght, resilience and humane spirit.|, I'd love to see more footage from the 1800s-early 1900s be restored like this. This is amazing. It captures the story in 2020 lens and allows the people in the film to be a lot more relatable.|, Revisiting after a year. I wanted to confirm that, in 2020, it was still the greatest thing I've ever seen in 50 years on earth. Confirmed.|, The last few minutes of the documentary during which the soldiers tell us that no one identified with them nor wanted to hear about their experiences in the war after they’d come back was heartbreaking.|, My generation doesn’t realize how good they got it. They think this cant happen again. But it can. God bless those great men|, I remember that my grandfather told me stories about my great grandfather, who was serving as mounted medic for the Germans in WW1 and positioned around Belgium, facing the crulest scenes on both sides. He told my grandpa, that at some point at the end of the war, everybody of either side helped to rescue every injured person on the battlefields, no matter of nationality or rank, just because they wanted to ""show hell, that it had no chance to settle on earth"". We are all brothers and sisters.|, The last WW1 soldier died in 2012, then this film was made just 6 years after. It would have been so sweet if he had lived long enough to see this film. So he could've seen his friends who fought along side him once again.|, All these soldiers looking into the camera not realizing that in 100 years millions of people will be look back at them. Such a masterpiece!!!!|, Took my teenage son to see it in theatre. It impacted us so strongly we both teared up. Then he could appreciate the sacrifice his great great grandfather had made."
Things to Come,THINGS TO COME (H.G. WELLS) 🎬 Exclusive Full Sci-Fi Movie Premiere 🎬 English HD 2023,knOd-BhRuCE,681878,9849,963,"This film was so ahead of it's time! In third grade (1976) the first books I ever checked out of my school's library were H.G. Wells novels, and they were incredibly inspirational. This film was aired on television every so often when I was a kid, a gem, thank you for adding it!|, ""We need to put an end to war before it puts an end to us"". Those words always stuck with me and will always ring true.|, The first 30 minutes or so of this is amazing.  That HG Wells meddled too deeply in the project (a superior writer who knew nothing about making movies) made it less of a movie than it ended up being.  And this one is a true classic, despite Wells' sometimes ham-handed dialogue.  Great performances all through this, especially Sir Ralph Richardson's scene-munching turn as The Boss.  Considering this was made primarily in 1935 (released in '36), marvel at the effects available at the time.  There was nothing like it before, and the blueprint for many movies that came after.  I have the full Criterion set this was taken from;  excellent print.|, A groundbreaking film right up there with Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Looking back at what transpired after this film came out showed how prescient it was. An excellent cast of the greats of that era.|, I've seen this extraordinary film countless times over the course of my 80 years, but I had to take the time to watch this particular YouTube video, because this is by far the cleanest, sharpest print of this film I've ever seen.  Every frame of this film is a feast for the eyes.  I have the colorized version of this film on a Blu-ray disk and it appears to have been made from a print with more scratches and imperfections than this print.   I recently, bought a high quality projector, and seeing this beautiful print of the film on a screen as large as the image would have appeared in a theater was an amazing experience.  I felt like I had time traveled back to 1936 and was watching the film when it premiered in a London theater.  There are only a few minor imperfections in the image here and there......  very few considering the age of the film.  With very little restoration, using modern digital techniques, the picture quality would be as perfect as it was when the film was first shown, maybe even better.|, ""Wings over the world"" -- Memorable dialog. This film is somewhat grim, but also quite prophetic and hopeful. I would like to dedicate this film in very loving memory of my grandparents -- both English -- both survivors of ""The Blitz."" Many thanks for posting this remarkable film!|, A salute to the incredible intellect and creative genius of H.G. Wells.
Unfortunately the story remains the same: Humanity is stupid, and there is always some evil jackass to take advantage of that. 
""Have a nice day""
Thanks for the beautiful movie, all the best...|, I can hardly praise this movie highly enough ! 
The photographic  quality and the  way it's coordinated,  the power of it's imagination.|, Long ago, an enterprising promoter found out that H.G.Wells and Orson Welles were both going to be in San Antonio at the same time.  He got them together in the studio for a brief chat, which is quite fascinating.  Sound quality is excellent.  Orson fanboying in the presence of the great H.G., talking about the film he was making at the time (Citizen Kane) and Welles chiding him about ""that radio program"".  A present from Arthur C. Clarke.  Wish I could post it here.|, The Art Deco Atmosphere of the whole movie Is a feature not to be ignored; a big film from any angle, great actors, fantastic book and dreamy scenarios. What else can you ask for? A Master Piece! Thank you for posting."

I can't wait to watch the sequel :D|, this movie is definitely the funniest movie I've watch in a long while
I laugh so hard  i couldn't breathe, never a dull moment with kevin|, The crazy thing is that most of these women are in the 30's and 40's! Gorgeous!|, Regardless of the negative comments and opinions, im sure this movie will gross as much as the first film. I love that these actors/actresses are continuing to stay relevant! I understand some ppl think the movie is ""typical"", but it may turn out to be a great film. We need to speak more positively.|, I saw this movie on the 1st day and had a wonderful time in a crowded theater. It was fun, funny, interesting and also had very touching moments and some decent moral points made. Good acting with sexy upscale images of black folks. Looks to me like the racists need to be mad. We dulling their shine.|, I can't wait to see this...looks like its going to be funny as hell and at the start of summer too! Lord knows we can't wait to summer with the crazy and extended winter we been having!!!|, I cant wait to see it. This is a great cast and I dont think they would sign on to do it if the script wasnt right so I cant wait. and I love to see the brothers and sisters looking good.|, I'm actually really excited to see this one! LOVED the first one! |, I don't think Kevin Hart is in enough movies."
This Changes Everything,This Changes Everything 2018,YQDiH1k06cw,5537,76,12,"I don't know how these poor women pulled through and survived 😢|, So what is really going on here? Is the movie industry predicated on sexual signaling. Take the sexual click-bait out and the stories become banal,
boring, ho-hum, trite. One question is whether or not the women centrist stories would make any money. I don't think Hollywood is necessarily sexist, I mean it is but what I'm saying is it's first priority is to make films that make money... follow the money. People, men, go to movies because they want to feel something. So the feelgood movies, the action movies that create suspense and pump the adrenaline peppered with sexual signaling that stimulates the predominately male feelgood hormonal response, these movies actually hack our biology because we are hard wired to respond to sexual stimuli, these movies make the money.
Women can make any story they want, will they have a real audience, will they make any money.... 

Our movie are repetitive, why do we keep going to see the same o'l same o'l? Because they keep stroking our juices and we like it.
So what it really comes down to, outside of the fact that we are an under educated immature people who really need to learn more about our own inner spiritual power, but outside of that what we seem to have here is a situation sort of like prostitutes upset that the pimps are making the lions share of the money and they want to see that change. If you want real change then you have to have real change and stop selling sexual titillation. And of course it's a catch 22 because they wouldn't sell it if we did not buy it. If you do that then the porn sights will just become more popular then they already are. So why do we buy it...? 

If you want real change then you really have to look at turning social awareness away from the centrally sexualized lizard libido and educate them towards their own higher spiritual nature by focusing on their third or single eye.
And so it comes back to understanding an age old story of battling the Dragon, the lower sexualized lizard brain that is hard wired to maintain procreation, a lower base instinct, and instead learn to overcome these urges and tame the dragon and through gaining an understanding of the benefits of self-control of the mind, rise and release a greater energy and power than can ever be experienced through sexual pursuits. AND THIS WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING"

The humor was so subtle and the story so heartbreaking and hilarious. I loved it|, ""I saw you have babies. Payback time"" lmaoo I love it|, 10/10 would recommend. This movie shows the Good, the bad and the ugly in family life at the age of 40. Loved every second of it|, Apatow continues to deliver hilarious movies and his wife is both beautiful, believable, and beautiful. Unlike some celebrities children, his kids can act. If you don't like these kinds of films, go elsewhere for your entertainment but for me and my time in life, I am grateful to laugh at the stressful crap we endure to have a family and life.|, Great movie - I laughed throughout the film! I am a huge fan of Paul Rudd. I highly recommend to watch it - especially as if you are on the boarder of entering your forties like me =).|, My All time favorite movie ever the laughs just don’t stop, this trailer just doesn’t show how out right hilarious this movie really is 100000% reccomend|, This is a freaking HILARIOUS movie!!! I must say.....40 was DEFINITELY NOT my best age!!! I was 40 when my husband of 18.5 years decided to move out and have an affair....and then he MARRIED the mistress 2 yrs later.  He now has the perfect little COOKIE CUTTER life that I guess he's ALWAYS WANTED and that I apparently couldn't give him.|, I'm happy they're a family again in another comedy! So excited!

This Is Where I Leave You,This Is Where I Leave You - Official Trailer [HD],fH0cEP0mvlU,9759681,34889,1465,"Does anyone else think this is one of the most underrated films ever made? Its absolutely heartwarming  and hillarious whilst being heartbreaking at the same time. Honestly one of my favourite films. It also has one of Adam Drivers best performances he is hysterical in this movie.|, I never understood why the critics didn't like this movie. It was a really heartwarming film about love and loss. Like, really heavily themed in the loss category. Plus it doesn't hurt that the cast was simply amazing. Nobody felt out of place, the chemistry between the family felt very real (as open as they were with everything), not to mention the supporting cast (Timothy Olyphant showing some great range in his acting chops here). And of course the funniest bits had me in tears at some points. Seriously, if you haven't seen this movie, it's a pretty good watch.|, This is a really beautiful movie. You get the emotions and the message hand in hand with many laughs (and a great cast). It shows you that despite all of life's battles and tough roads and all of your personal imperfections, you will be okay in the end, and you will always have people who will stick through the yucky stuff with you. I highly highly recommend it for anyone who has not watched it.|, Love the sadness and the calm feelings I have while watching it. Me being like: I feel you dude. This movie was there for me like the people in the movie were there for each other. And there is a hazy beauty behind a certain kind of sadness that says, there you are, at the lowest point of your life and nothing can hurt you anymore.....kind of make you feel invincible and not anxious anymore. Maybe that s what s beautiful about being sad.        (btw, being sad is not being desperate. Being desperate is before sad...and being desperate usually freaks people out.......)|, For those scrolling through comments to see whether it's worth to watch or not. Totally recommend this! So much emotions and also funny. Really miss my siblings now|, I don't care that critics thought this was mediocre, this movie has everything I like in it and I've spent hours watching it. If you don't mind some predictability and also want a movie about dysfunctional adult sibling relationships without it being super dramatic, this is it. It's worth giving a chance to.|, This was honestly one of the best movies I've ever seen. So emotional, yet funny, and so realistic and honest... I want to see it again!|, Never seen Adam D sooo funny. Bateman excellent with perfect timing, Tina Fey heckling like a true sibling, Jane Fonda is Being There for Shrink Moms...
For Anyone who ever had 3 or more siblings, this will resonate.|, Why am I just now discovering this movie???? Looks great. This cast is perfect. Gonna watch it tonight.|, Oh how i loved this movie. Forgot the title and now im so glad watching it again."

Lol.. I laughed so hard whenever he said that.. The movie was great and very funny. I would definitely recommend going to see it :)|, To those who don’t know, there were talks to make a sequel to this film. The idea was that apocalypse occurs at the premiere of the first film. I guess that means everyone would barricade the entrance at the movie theater and everyone would have to survive on popcorn, candy, hotdogs, and sodas. They said Seth Rogen would be a cokehead in this version, Michael Cera would be a calm dude with a boyfriend, Rihanna and The Backstreet Boys would be back, and that they would show more of heaven and also see hell and the Garden of Eden version where Danny McBride is Adam. The problem is all of the actors had scheduling conflicts and probably wouldn’t have made it work. Seth Rogen said that he didn’t think a sequel could happen, but if it did, it would be called “No, THIS Is the End”.|, My favorite lines are:
Emma Watson: ""I'M NOT FOOLING AROUND!"" 
Danny McBride: ""Hermione stole all of our STUFF!""|, This really is one of the greatest comedies ever. The cameos are insane and I couldn't stop laughing 😂😂|, i agree. what makes these guys so funny to watch together is that chemistry. all of them have been connected to each other in one way or another. whether it be through judd apatow, some television series or another movie. you can tell that these guys are all genuine friends at the end of the day.|, One of the best comedies in recent years. 21 Jump Street is the only thing that comes close from the 2010s.|, absolute underated gem of a comedy movie, wish they'd make more of these!|, Saw this movie at an advanced screening last week, almost peed my pants laughing so much.  It it RIDICULOUS.  Absolutely brilliant and hilarious.  I laughed out loud the whole time."

Can't wait for this one ⚡|, I dont want Thor to be goofy. I want him to be a badass.|, I love the part when Thor swoops down on Stormbreaker, screaming ""It's Thorrin' time!"" and then proceeds to Odinson all over the bad guys. Truly one of the most scenes ever.|, How many of you felt that Trailer is better than the actual movie?🙋|, My favorite part is when he said ""its good guy time"" and good guy'd all the bad guys. Truly a spectacle that can't be replicated|, I swear, this movie had an assload of potential, and they missed it all 😢|, I'm interested in how Gorr's appearance seems to change over the course of the film *into something more monstrous, probably because of the necrosword.*|, I enjoyed Thor and I agree that Gorr probably didn't get the development he deserved. I understand though that you can't create a Thanos in every movie and sometimes you need a villain just to run through within the single outing. Gorr may have been a poor choice for this scenario as he is perhaps a little too in depth and too powerful to make out of one movie especially when you cast freaking Bale to do it. I mean consider Ragnarok also had a single villain who no longer existed in the storyline afterwards but nobody was upset about it.|, I love when he comes off from the sky and then proceeds to thunders everyone with the catch praise “get thundered”. Truly a scene, wow|, The part where Thor said ""It's thunder time"" and thundered Patrick Bateman really put me to tears. Truly a movie"

Hes not surprised. It's almost like he's proud that his brother has unlocked his true power.|, I get goosebumps everytime Odin says “you’re stronger” just such a powerful line with great delivery.|, Though many may consider The battle of Wakanda Thor's best moment, for me this is one of the best action scenes in the history of MCU. It also truly shows Thor fully unlocking and using his powers without Mjolnir and realizing that it's him with power not his hammer. Brilliant.|, Thor-""I'm not as strong as you""
Odin-""No you're stronger""
This line hit me!|, -Thor's badass entry on the beat drop
-Loki's sleek and ninja style fighting 
-Hulk wrestling with that huge monstrous wolf 
-Valkyrie's badass slow-mo walk with fireworks 
All played together on the Immigrant Song is just superior level of-
    ✨P E R F E C T I O N✨|, Loki's smile means he's no longer jealous of his brother. He's actually proud of what he's become. This was the final part of his story arc, and a fitting end to him.|, I love how this scene proves that Thor is a god and not someone wielding a hammer, it allows us to see his power|, This scene encapsulates everything I love about the MCU. A couple of witty/campy lines, emotional moments, subtle humour, and over-the-top crazy action. Not to mention the OST when Thor is talking to Odin is incredibly beautiful. 

If only Love and Thunder could have lived up to Ragnarok.|, After everything that happened between Thor and Loki right from the first Thor film in 2011 till Ragnarok, it was heartbreaking to see Loki die just a few hours after this battle considering the fact that both the brothers had reconciled"

After all these bad reviews I heard, I watched it and found it surprisingly entertaining. The action sequences are great, the plot is decent, and there's a lot of humor as well, not to mention great brother love-hate relationship between Thor and Loki. As for the latter, out of all the movies we've seen him in, this is for me the best version of Loki in the entire MCU franchise.|, Am I the only one who loves this movie?

Terrific actors. Great writing. What more could you have asked for.|, Just saw the movie and I loved it, but I gotta say that whoever edited this trailer is a genius. Imagine the movie to be paced in a similar way as this trailer, a bit like the pace in Shaun of the Dead. Adds another layer of visual humour imo.|, 5 years old! 
I remember seeing it with my older sister 
The movie is divided into chapters showing the progression of their lives going from one thing to the next 
Think of it as 'American Psycho' meets 'Heathers'
Takes the issues of the young and privileged turning them into something violent 
The girls here are incapable of empathy yet the viewing is weird, funny and at times thought-provoking with plenty of sharp dialogue 
Serves as an unsettling character study of potential psychopaths with a stage play presence 
Plus it doesn't have to provide easy answers 
These girls bring out each other's worst qualities the more time they spend together realizing that they are thoroughbred humans in a world that doesn't raise them the right way 
Lily in particular you can see her slowly losing herself with each moment almost to the breaking point 
Even though they were bred from a long line of the best blood relatives they still have their own issues to work out albeit in a violent and unforgiving capacity yet they have the uncommon strength and endurance to survive it 
All of it slowly builds up to a final shot that'll leave you somewhat satisfied in a twisted sense 
Cooke and Joy are brilliant in this with smooth direction by Corey Finley|, RIP Anton. Great actor who passed way too soon.|, Great casting and an interesting concept! Whoever made this film should be proud.|, Anya Taylor joy is beautifully hypnotic. One of the coolest actresses ever"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI | Official Red Band Trailer | FOX Searchlight",Jit3YhGx5pU,10379645,48479,3342,"This was one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years. It had everything a good movie needs.
10/10|, I always laugh at that scene where she drives away.  The delivery was definitely Oscar worthy.  And Sam Rockwell really deserved best supporting actor.|, This is simple a masterpiece. I cried a lot during the movie.
Three billboards outside ebbing, missouri is a real emotive movie. The characters are written perfectly, they are so humans.
I need to say thank you to Martin McDonagh, his movie moves me so much.|, This film shows us in an absolutely intelligent way how you can mix drama, humor, sarcasm and some comedy in perfect balance. Frances McDormand deserves all the Oscars 👍🏻|, I love McDormand. She feels so real in every role she's in. Oddly, she's always likable, even in unlikable roles.|, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is, without a doubt, one of the best movies I’ve seen in quite some time. An absolute classic, well written, produced, shot and acted - brilliant all round.|, This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was very moving in crucial moments, a bit depressing in other ones and, on the whole, was a thought-provoking film because of the fact that it is a pretty realistic description of what trauma does to people and what it's like to live with it.|, Easily one of the best films of 2017. Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell deserve all the praise they get, acting is superb and the story grips to the very end.|, Martin Mcdonagh writes easily some of the best and most hilarious dialogue I’ve ever heard in movies ❤️ It’s like wonderful sweary poetry|, Πέρα από κάποια νοήματα που περνάει η ταινία και ωραία εκτέλεση ρόλων δεν είναι τίποτα το τρομερό καθώς και το τέλος της είναι κάτι απροσδιόριστο...."
Three Identical Strangers,Three Identical Strangers Trailer #1 (2018) | Movieclips Indie,c-OF0OaK3o0,4413847,59537,1130,"This documentary rocked me to my core. The experimentation of human beings is the most inhumaine thing you can do.|, Saw this movie yesterday, and it was absolutely extraordinary. Amazing reporting, real human sincerity, delightful jubilance, mystery, heartbreak, and the most powerful horror film I've seen this year. Here's hoping the film wins the Best Documentary Oscar, and the pressure comes crushing down on Yale University (a central, malevolent figure in what happened to these boys) that the university is forced to reveal the uncensored truth of what really happened. Don't miss this film.|, Incredible documentary. I heard that people behind this unethical adoption agency didn't want this film made. People wanted to tell this story years ago. It's disgraceful that the people in charge interfered with the lives of these triplets and others that were twins. They had no business trying to conduct experiments that caused secret separation of siblings.|, Imagine if Bobby didn’t go to that specific college. Imagine if he just randomly decided he wanted to start a life in another country and not look back. They would’ve never knew about each other and the experiment. It’s crazy how life works|, This story was both touching and sad to me at the same time. I have a pretty troubling adoption story myself so it really hit home with me.|, Its so heartbreaking that they were separated at birth and did not know that the others existed . What is so amazing is how they found each other at 19. No matter how much the nefarious people at the adoption agencey tried to keep them apart they found each other anyway. It is bigger than nature over nurture . They were meant to be part of each others lives. This is what is so awesome.|, Is no one going to talk about how cute they were back then? 😂|, I felt bad for Eddy's father when he said that he felt like he didn't teach him something 😥|, this looks like one of the only genuinely unique and good movies to come out in a while. i’m so excited for it!!|, I just watched this movie during my psychology class and WOW the director did an amazing job making me laugh and cry.

Very moving and quite incredible. So special that this has been colorized. These people spring to life before your eyes. What a beautiful tribute to a destroyed world.|, I didn’t have Polish relatives, but any of these faces look like they could be family. 
My father was at the death camps. Whenever I see those films I look for him. 
The freedom of information act allowed us to see his military record. It was unbelievable because he never wanted to discuss the war. 
This film, all three minutes of it is a jewel of proof. The way it was lengthened is a masterful piece of art.

That would be soul destroying to a normal person, that’s what makes you very special Jana👍|, Amazing film❤
I was extremely excited about it. Hope to see some more. Keep going 🤚|, This is def. one of the most inspiring bike documentaries, and I have seen a lot of them. What a character, tough as nails, I felt her suffering since the first morning shown in her eyes by a lack of sleep, last day, I saw only a smile in those eyes. Did you say she cycled back to Innsbruck? Even more respect BTW: whoever filmed this, wow. Really cool.|, Such an awesome experience!|, Oh wow. Ich bin über Umwege zu diesem Film gekommen vor 2 Tagen gekommen (bin  auch in dem schwäbischen Nest aufgewachsen und kannte aus Tanzkurszeiten Onkel und Vater)  - und ich bin geflashed. Was für eine Leistung! Was für eine mentale Stärke. Was für eine Frau! Der Film ist einfach nur klasse: Die Leistung von Jana so rüberzubringen. Die Nächte, der Hunger. Der Frust. Und vor allen Dingen ihre Freude in den Augen! Wahnsinn die Bilder. Und die Musikauswahl ist so wunderschön, passend. Ich glaub, ich habe jetzt fast alle Filme durch. Einfach nur MEGA. 👍❤|, Most probably the best cycling documentary I have seen. Felt like I could watch this over and over again. 
Nailed it Stephan! We love you Jana.|, Thank you for making one of the best ultra  endurance cycling films I have had the pleasure to watch. Great to see the focus on an individual rider suffering all the ups and downs of such a long ride. Jana's suffering clear to see makes us appreciate more the endeavours of these ultra cyclists...Nige 🙂👍🚴|, Phantastisch! 
Ein absoluter Leckerbissen für jeden interessierten Radfahrer, oder auch für die, die noch nicht infiziert sind.
Top Doku!
Hier sind zwei Dinge zusammengekommen, jemand der weiß wie man Filme macht und eine 100 Prozent authentische Darstellerin.

I love it when an original idea is brought to the cinema.  I’m all in!!|, Watched it last night and I absolutely loved this movie. It's rare nowadays that a movie teleports you to it's magic world, and this one does it so good. The stories, the visuals, the music - all 10 out of 10. It's gonna be one of my fav movies of all times.|, You know a movie is great when you don't even know what genre the trailer sets it out to be|, It is a shame this film wasnt more popular. It is a cinematic and story telling masterpiece.|, Storytelling at its finest, and another winner with Tilda.  No wonder it received 6 standing ovations at Cannes.  This will be in my movie collection.  Thank you, George Miller.|, Just saw this movie today Aug. 26th at the Universal Studios;   It is one of the most beautiful and profound movies I've seen in my life time and I'm 77.   Thank you all for bringing this message of love and love's magic to this world.  I'm going to enjoy watching it again and again.  Academy stuff big time!|, I am really happy that this type of blockbuster movies are being made, that is not tied to a franchise. I hope people do see it in big screen.|, This movie was incredible. I feel blessed to have watched it. In todays time it’s not many movies completely captivating the viewer and sparking genuine emotional pleasant thoughts. Everything was perfect to the acting and the storyline. I’ve never read a book from cover to cover but this movie inspires you to read and leaves an emptiness of wanting more while hoping the movie never ends. Writing a review is definitely not my thing but this movie compelled me to do such. Take my word for it and let the movie take you away into a journey. I wished there were more just like as in sequels. This was pure magic and the viewer receives a gift by watching. Thank you and thank you.|, It was one of the best movies I’ve ever watched. It’s a bit weird… but if you flow with it I actually felt it had a very relaxing intelligent and unorthodox rhythm to how it was written produced and acted. Acting was very very good for the two main actors and most of the cast. I don’t want to ruin it for anybody that has not seen it but I will say wholeheartedly that you should watch it and that it’s a love story despite the humor and the idea of wishes being made. It surprised me and it’s one of those movies that left me thinking and feeling different in a good way after finishing it. Two thumbs way up.|, Just saw this. I really liked it! It was a true story (as in, a true type of old-fashioned narrative) and the costumes/effects were amazing. I think the characters REALLY shined; not just Swinton’s and Elba’s, but all the other ones you meet. They were all well-written, unique, and felt very real. My mom liked it too!"

Amitabh Bachchan 's role in this was so excellent ""what an energy""|, This film had everything it needed. A powerful production house, a ton of money, A-listing actors and a very talented crew. Sadly, just because of a lackluster script and very cliched ideas imparted into the film and a director who doesn't even know the D of direction, the film failed to break through and emerge as a blockbuster. If only YRF had put a little more effort by fine tuning the script without the interference of actors, then the film would have been a milestone in the Indian Cinema.|, Katrina has more screen time in trailer than whole movie😂|, Though film is not that good but Aamir Khan performance as always 🔥|, Doesn't matter, how bad you think this movie's plot, VFX and direction is, but you've to accept the fact that aamir completely nailed his character with Perfection,  His comic timing, dialogue delivery body language And Everything while portraying FirangiMallah was beyond Exception!! Hats off to Him!!
Movie floped becoz of over expectations, Poor direction lack of thrill and suspence And Worst VFX!!
That's it 🙏🙏|, Que filme maravilhoso quero que chegue no Brasil logo😍😍😍😍|, Awesome movie....worth to be watched.....hatsoff to amitabh bacchan sir...at this age the way he has done all the fighting scenes it's totally remarkable.....🙌🙌|, Wow!

Definitely a must see, comedic timing by Julie & George is perfect 🤣😁👍🏼.  That dancing!!! 
Plus…Bali is beautiful, so what’s not to love with this movie!|, I'm not a fan, but I'm genuinely amazed on how Maxime could get such a big opportunity like this. Congrats!

I started watching the film and laughed about it; it seemed innocuous enough. But boy oh boy was I wrong. Just to be clear, this is not a mockumentary. But at the end, you'd wish it was. I haven't enjoyed a documentary as much since The Imposter.|, Watched it yesterday, one of the best documentaries I've ever watched. Well done!|, My father was a tickle bully and wouldn't stop till he made you cry as a kid. I soon learned I could disengage. I needed a couple seconds between tickles to mentally prepare and then I would shut down. No tickling, hitting, yelling, ...whatever... could get me laughing again. Till next time.|, This is real. I almost did it but declined because I was just thought it was too weird and was worried people would find out I got paid to be tickled. It was just too weird for me. this was back in 2008 when I got in contact with them.|, this actually looks interesting. looks like it begins with something silly with real money being thrown around, but quickly turns into a bottomless blackmail hole.|, I'm tempted to call this film a masterpiece.

Till,TILL | Official Trailer | MGM Studios,rkQi6GBwmSA,4851585,30296,4432,"I had the privilege of meeting his mother when she spoke to my sociology class in high school. Such a strong woman.|, It’s extremely traumatizing how many films they made of him, because we all know how the story ends and his accuser is still walking free. I couldn’t even finish watching the show because it was too emotional and as a mother myself to a boy I couldn’t imagine the pain. But I understand they are trying to reach a new audience and his life and story will never die. Unfortunately it’s so many like Emmett who fell to the same fate. God bless his family and his soul.|, I still remember learning about this in 8th grade, and our teacher showing us the picture of Emmett’s open casket was a life-changing moment. Definitely wanna see this film and how they tell the story, but also demand that Carolyn Bryant be arrested for what she did to an innocent boy.|, What a strong strong and brave woman his mother was. She went through the most unimaginable and unbearable pain of losing her child. To have to see her child needlessly and brutally murdered for NO REASON. Yet, she still stood up to get justice for change for her boy. God bless her. And God Bless Emmett Till as well. No person should ever have to endure what he did. Much less a child! He may not have gotten to live the life he was meant to, but his legacy will live on forever!|, I got the privilege of being in this movie. No lines, but I’m the person sitting in front of Danielle in the scene at 1:18 when she’s at work. The experience was just amazing. To film with such an amazing crew and just to be a teeny tiny part of telling this amazing story. One of my life highlights. I hope everyone watches this, as hard as it is to face.|, Omg I cried through most of the movie.  It is so sad and must have been extremely hard for the actors to  do.  It did not even seem like a movie.  I felt I was experiencing it as if I was there and I felt the anger, sadness, frustration, prejudice, injustice along with other emotions and feelings.  This movie is a must see for everyone.|, My dad and Emmett were born on the same day. It really wasn’t that long ago when you think about it. Which is exactly why this story needs to be told over and over again, especially after what those kids did to his marker.|, Carolyn Bryant Donham. “Donham adds that she ‘always felt like a victim as well as Emmett’ and ‘paid dearly with an altered life’ for what happened to him.” The audacity of this woman.|, So gut-wrenching.. It’s unimaginable what Emmett and his mother went through.. And Carolyn Bryant had the nerve to say she was a victim in all of this..|, Me having a 20 yr old son and just thinking about him going through this at 14 is just unimaginable. Just got done watching this and this is the only movie in my 44 years of life..that I shed a tear in front of my family. I've fought back many tears in movies ..its when she seen his body I just couldn't fight that no matter what. I'm heartbroken from past America. God bless you Emmitt.

A must watch for any film lover, especially completely and utterly bizarre films.|, Saw this gem last night. Excellent approach of the psychologic terror and body horror. Julia Ducournau really knows how to combine different genres and influences without compromising her signature and her vision of horror. Also, Agathe Roussel and Vincent Lindon are absolutely STELLAR in their roles and a great attention is showed with the cinematography and the editing.
Certainly it will divide, but I truly believe this is one of the best contemporary films that Ive seen recently!|, Love trailers that give you a good sense of the film's vibe without giving away the story or showing too much ❤️|, I loved this movie because I had no idea what I was getting myself into. It felt like it could’ve turned into anything at any waking moment|, Saw it last week. While the movie could have probably been packaged a little more cleanly, I was very impressed with the filmmaking and performances from Lindon and Rouselle. I wouldn’t recommend this film to everyone but do appreciate a director who is willing to push the boundaries on common life / movie topics, specially those of growing up and getting older.|, This is not just a movie, it's an experience of a different kind. Mindblowing!|, Didn't know what to think of this film after I first saw it, but it hasn't escaped my mind for days, and every day I'm falling more and more in love with it. Can't wait to see what Ducournau does next.|, an absolutely provocative dizzying film that goes from horror to the extreme to suddenly turn into something mindblowing.  5 stars out of 5, recommended to all movie lovers!|, Just been to see it. Bonkers. From start to finish, just batshit crazy. Fearless filmmaking that walks with one foot in the 'C'mon, that's just TOO stupid' ditch, while at the same time holding you up by the scruff of the neck so you stay clear of the stupid.
I can't wait to see it again. Daughter coming to visit next week, we do love bizarro cinema, but actually this might not be a great dad/daughter experience - if you've seen it, you'll know what I mean 😵. I think I'll send her to a screening while I sit in the bar lol!

She had based Atticus on her own father, and when he came out of costume for filming, she cried and he told her it was his honor to play Atticus, and he only hoped he could do the character justice.|, As a child, reading the book, the worst part was from Scout's pov, when she says a jury never looks into the eye of the one they have just judged. Gregory Peck was a genius.|, The scene that made me fall in love with cinema. Atticus Finch and Gregory Peck are one and the same to me. A film that must never ever not be shown in middle school.|, For all you fans of superhero movies, look no further than Atticus Finch. The hero’s hero."

Salute to him for choosing to do such films and making it commercially hit as well to encourage writers/directors.|, People are judging a movie without watching it?? This movie was hilarious and sent a good message!|, I am non Indian and I have just watched this movie on Netflix with subtitles. I have to admit that It is actually a lot more than a problem of toilet. Great messages are given throughout the movie so it is a ""must-see"" one. I love Bollywood ❤️|, Amazing movie, i went into it expecting a bubble gum movie that will soon end with a musical but nope it’s soo much deeper than that and touched on soo many societal issues, I learned so much the actors left me in awe, just perfect❤️❤️❤️|, only Akshay paaji can make such film with that title which is funny to hear but carries astounding facts and deeper  message behind them.. that's why I love Akshay Kumar.. this will be the best film till now in this year..|, I went to see this movie yesterday in NYC and I have to say it is one of the best movies I've seen this year so far. Better than Hollywood. It made me sad, angry and happy. Great movie. 👍👌|, I think those who have disliked this trailer are not have toilet in their homes😂😂😂|, I can relate to this movie. I’m a Canadian born girl with Indian heritage. Back when I was young my parents took me to India and we visited our ancestral village - which had no toilets. Me being from North America made a huge fuss about this, and I couldn’t understand why the locals thought I was weird for wanting a toilet. Fast forward 20 years, I’m happy to say every house in my ancestral village has a toilet. Yay for progress|, Filme lindooo e além de tudo , real!!! Amo filmes indianos, top !!! Uma cultura totalmente diferente da minha, coisas que JAMAIS imaginei, não ter banheiro!!!|, I’m glad that this movie is bringing light to the issues in India. We are just so used to seeing glamor in Bollywood movies that something like this is different and should be appreciated."
Tolkien,TOLKIEN | Trailer 2 | FOX Searchlight,wZ1vn85iQRE,7564610,56162,3329,"I just hope they show how his Catholicism, his love of Norse and Germanic myths, his love of languages, his children, his wife and his experiences in the war were all important influences on his writings.|, I just saw this movie yesterday; it's a gem and it completely flew under the radar. If you enjoyed movies like The Imitation Game, and The Theory Of Everything, you'll enjoy this. It has the same heartfelt storytelling plus Thomas Newman's score is a work of art. Also I looked into it and most of the story beats are true to life, if romanticized/adjusted for film. If what's holding you back is The Tolkien estate not approving it, remember that their opinion of the LOTR trilogy was also low, despite it being (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of film ever made.|, When you think that the greatest love story of Middle Earth, the one of Beren and Lúthien, was inspired by the love Tolkien had for his wife... This is so beautiful!|, ""After all, I believe legends and myths are largely made of truth."" 


- J.R.R. Tolkien|, ""Tell me a story, in any language you want""

one of most beautiful sentence an author could hear|, He lost so many friends in WW1 and somehow took that insane experience, pain and passion and created one of the most amazing stories/fantasy worlds of our lifetime. I love LOTR but I really wish i could've met this man|, “Well, all good stories deserve embellishment. You’ll have a tale or two to tell when you come back.”
- Gandalf|, One of the greatest writing prodigies of all time. The depth of his imagination is beyond comprehension. He will live forever through the stories he gave us!|, This man single handily made fantasy what it is today. Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs, Goblins, Trolls, Rangers, Hobbits, and Ents wouldn’t exist without him. Legend.|, My mother read the series to me while I was in the womb, I read it during my 6th grade year. Tolkien definately opened a new door to the fantasy world.
The world that is, the world that was, the world to come."

Tomb Raider rocks!|, This is good, I like animated. You can do so much more for less and have a much more engaging experience. More adult animation is what we need|, Honestly wasn't expecting much from this teaser but the animation is balanced, the character design is consistent, the art style is reminiscent of that comic book style used by Man of Action studios adventure cartoons with a touch of season one of Castlevania. Netflix miss more than they hit with adaptations but this looks like it might hit. I hope it sticks the landing, Lara could do with a win.|, This was announced AGES ago. Nice to see it finally getting done.|, It looks amazing and I hope the animation and story of the Tomb Raider series goes well. I love Tomb Raider from the games and films, and I'm glad they decided to make this and keep the Lara croft legend alive for more years to come.😊👍|, Esta serie va a ser todo un acontecimiento porque Lara Croft tiene muchas historias por contar.|, The doors Castlevania has opened 👏👏👏

So excited to see these series pop up! Can't wait to watch! 😍|, A good fit. I grew up with her as an action icon. She's right up there with James Bond in my list of favorite characters.|, Lara Croft is one of the iconic gaming characters. It's time she's gotten her chance to expand to an anime.

Every actor did fantastic.|, I'm looking forward to seeing this.|, Jack Lowden in War and Peace was great. Looking forward to this.|, It absolutely blows my mind that there is still a British nobility and they put up with that. These people did nothing to deserve it other than being born into the right family and the Brits simply go along with it.|, the recipe for a great movie:

They’ve come a long way and I’m proud of them for branching out and diversifying their content.|, i will be watching for rowoon! excited to see him in a drama that is more like action and a mystery 🙀|, It goes over sexual assault, comfort women, SUICIDE!, war veterans, body shaming, losing a loved one, being overworked.

Think of those that love you and the way they'd feel.|, this drama is an eye opener to everyone. it talks about a lot of social issues and hardships so i understand that its not for everyone.

I hope they give him lead role next project.|, Please renew it for a second season! Quite literally the best kdrama I have ever come across!

It does not matter that it is a supernatural drama. Everyone is getting ""Just Desserts""! 👍|, 1000/10 This series is undoubtedly one of the best of this year, excellent stories, music and suspense.

Toni Erdmann,Toni Erdmann | Official US Trailer (2016),j0uwi5EPnpA,1261342,1724,277,"I am a 26 year old guy in Sweden and when my friends told me that they wanted to see a 3 hour long ""culture"" movie I was opposed it. I was soo wrong about the movie. It was a wonderful cringe fest where the father of a ""corporate"" women tries to get her attention and save her from being unhappy. I cried at the movie climax and I never cry. Afterwards I called my mother and father and told them how much I appreciate when they try to make me happy in their own way. I'll watch this type of movie over Iron man or Dr Strange at any time!|, Funny. Weird. Thought provoking.  Raw.  Uncomfortable to watch some scenes.  Emotional.  Overall a wonderful night at the movies!  We saw this in a crowded theatre in London and the audience was just wild… it really needs to be seen in such a setting for the optimal experience!  The film is to be celebrated for taking such risks, risks that serve the story.  🙌 🎞|, I wanted to see this movie ever since it arrived at the local theatre I work at but haven't been able to clear the time for it until yesterday. I had a wonderful, bittersweet and often hilarious experience... It made me really laugh and feel sad at the same time. I like long and slowly paced movies so I didn't mind the length or the pace. The father reminds me a lot of my late father, he was a really nonsensical, optimistic, funny and embarrasing kind of dad and person, and when he died of Cancer within 3 months while I was 19 I kind of took his example and tried to be the upbeat uplifting joking man in the family.|, One of the best movies ever - funny, quirky, interesting and very human. It's got the X factor people look for.|, Still the best film of the year. Ades screenplay is one of the most complex ones in recent memory. A masterpiece.|, Watched the movie yesterday. I didn't really know anything about it, as I'm not that much into film festivals or whatever. It started somewhat slowly, but it got more and more entertaining. The humor is at times a bit subtle, and I guess a very young audience might not have the life experience to relate to the characters, but for everybody else it seems nice.|, It's a shame that international movies don't get displayed as widely as home-made movies, in the US. There are at least 4 theaters nearby and none of them has Toni Erdmann on display.|, film addict warning: THIS IS A MUST WATCH AFTER WATCHING HUNDREDS OF FILMS THESE YEARS... I never post any comment for YouTube trailer... but this film is way too brilliant...|, A great movie. I went to the premiere and afterwards there was a light serving. They had the most wholesome petit-fours. Normally, there are three different kind of petit-four: Glacé (glazed), Salé (salted) and Sec (dry). Amazingly, they had managed to combine Glacé and Salé in one petit-four. Wonder how they do it...|, A really good movie. Sandra Hüller seems like a cross between Cate Blanchett and Michelle Williams. Loved her performance in this movie."
Top Five,30 Secrets YOU MISSED In Fortnite&#39;s BIG BANG EVENT!,zjvinnolCtU,365249,15274,1122,"I’m really excited for what Fortnite has in store for us. With the popularity of the OG Season, and the trailer of Chapter 5, this makes things even better.|, I love how Jonesy and Peely have been together since the beginning so it's funny how Chapter 5 Season 1 is gonna be about saving him. Shows us how connected they are and how great their friendship is.|, I think the event was really cool personally, I'm just hyped about next week and the fact that we're getting OG Fortnite AGAIN next year. I wonder how they will do it, send us back to season 1 or season 5 again, or have a completely different mode for that and have it there for a month or 2. I really like what Epic is doing so far and I hope to continue to see the thrive as they are now.|, I like the concept of Chapter 5 being that Peely gets kidnapped, sending Jones on a mission to save him and probably killing a lot of people in the process.|, Fortnite has just invented the Metaverse... 👽|, This event was honestly pretty good, not the best but it was very good, I liked the animation|, It was a very good event... the only problem I had was not seeing the whole thing because the game decided to crash only me out of the 6 people who were playing (had 2 others in a discord call to simulate more than 4 players in one lobby) straight after the Lego section was about to end (I think)... Funnily enough, the 2 PC players, me and my sister, had more issues than the console people, including a switch player. I honestly got mad that it crashed on me, especially when I planned things out earlier and logged on before the massive wave to beat queue, and that also ment not sleeping in on a weekend|, I’m HYPED for Chapter 5!|, The fact that he went back to replay just to tell us things that we missed, like thats fire 🔥"
Top Gun,Top Gun: Maverick,uFHh2pI0zqM,0,2731,273,"To all fans like me, this movie sure brought us a mountain of thrilling joy, hype and enthusiasm, especially for me because it was released in the exact same day as my 18th birthday. That theatre ticket was by far the best birthday gift I’ve ever had|, I've watched this 3 times already in IMAX. Each time was better than the last! This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.|, What a great movie.
Mainly because of the cast.
Even the Bad Guys are good.
Just so well done.
Thank you for this.
👋|, This and TAPS were the two movies that inspired me to join the army and then ultimately the navy. The eighties were a great decade for me. Sadly they are a million years behind me now.|, I was 13 when the original came out and loved it of course. Sequels so rarely deliver that I was wondering how it would be. I found some of the best *real* Navy Top Gun pilots doing a reaction video on YouTube, and while they had critiques like: ""so and so would get you court-martialed"" They loved it! So did I. I will def watch again. Tom Cruise did some really smart things by waiting for the right directors, working with the Navy, and he did a solid for struggling theatres (since the pandemic) and released it theatres only for the first run to build anticipation. Great film.|, Bravo!! It did not disappoint! Had to keep reminding myself to relax...omg, so much excitement. The air work is spectacular, like none other. Well done to all who brought this amazing film to the big screen.|, This is the perfect sequel to top gun 
It truly is a love letter to aviation 
🫡 to all men and women of the military thank you for your service|, After much wait and delay because of well........ we all know.  It was everything I could and wanted it to be.  It brought back memories from the Original, did some nice tip of the hats to it as well.  It did not disappoint in anyway.  It left me wanting more.  So nice to see a film done with so much real and practical effects, not something we see too much of in todays CGI world.|, I haven't seen a movie this good since Braveheart. Watching it in the theater on the big screen with amazing acoustics made it great. I would have liked to go back and see it a few more times but settled for purchasing it from the Google store, now I can watch my favorite parts when there's down time at work.  Truly a masterpiece!|, There won't be a better movie made, epic!"

Not by deconstructing him to pieces or with the same ""it's now older and bitter and useless"", but giving him a proper epic send off!

Thank you, Tom, for respecting your character and us.|, this movie has even made the youtube comments section civil, polite, professional, encouraging and fun. what a great movie.|, A good leader says it can be done, but a great leader proves it can be done!|, This scene was amazing for all the reasons below, but also because it was the moment they all truly earned their respect for their leader. He showed them that he wouldn’t make them do anything that he couldn’t do himself;that he couldn’t teach them to do. Oh and he did it with style as well, never deviating from his own personality.|, Just read an article about this scene (what brought me here) and the Navy Pilot actually flying the plane said that this is the one scene he would NOT want to ever do again!! Just knowing this is REAL makes it jaw dropping!!|, Say what you will, Jon Hamm plays this scene in immaculate fashion...half wishing to fail, half wishing to succeed.  The non-verbal acting is spot on|, How to do movies right and Tom is a veteran. Apart from all the good points mentioned here I also noticed the female pilot is not propped to be a femme fatale or a guy beater or a love interest. They don’t make her be an obnoxious girl boss either. She’s just another pilot who happens to be a woman and holds her own with the rest of the guys. No pandering here folks. Just a good female character.|, Saw this movie 3 times in the theater. First time my jaw was dropped holding my breath during this scene.. 2nd I was smiling ear to ear, third was emotional as I tear up. All three times were a rush of adrenaline and emotion. This is easily the best movie Ive seen in years.|, That's gotta be in the top 3 greatest movie scenes ever.  The sense of speed and g-force, the sound, the tension, the fact that it's a real jet with no CG... it's just perfection.|, Great movie - not only the flying scenes, but how Maverick comes to grips with his own age and how he still has much to offer.  Also, how very good our military aviators are - they are the ""best of the best."""

I've watched it plenty of times and still cry at the end. Definitely hits different now that I have a child of my own|, I cried while watching this. The end was very sad. This also explains that how humans are. Humans are rude to humans. Humans are kind to humans. I hope everyone understands the real message behind this movie|, This movie was referenced in a TV show, so I thought to watch it. It kept my attention the entire way through. The originality, the acting, the emotional rollercoaster, ah! As a lot of folks have mentioned, the ending is heartbreaking. I didn't all out cry, but I definitely choked up.

The scenery of the movie was also beautiful 🙃|, One Of The Best Zombie Movie Of All Times 👍👍👍👍😘😘|, Dammit... Even the trailer makes me get all teary eyed. That little girl deserves every acting award in existence|, I just finished watching the movie and though the movie was great, I didn't like the ending for a lot of the main characters (if you watched it, you know what I mean) very unfair. This was one of the saddest endings I have ever seen. I cried my eyes out. That little girl is such a good actress.  This movie proves that Korean movies are notorious for sad endings.|, i still dont understand how a zombie movie made me cry... such a fascinating and mindblowing movie...|, Please Hollywood, don't remake this movie and ruin it."

Transcendence,Transcendence Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Johnny Depp Sci-Fi Movie HD,VCTen3-B8GU,17864718,57702,5495,"Loved this film, and Johnny Depp in particular was perfection. His performance was understated yet haunting; I don’t know how to describe it, but it was beautiful and I find that this film has stayed with me.|, This movie is just awesome, how it flows from beginning to end is nicely written and it satisfies your curiosity and deliver more than expected. I have watched this movie 3 times and it left me contemplating tech, future and humanity everytime. Idk why it has bad reception among critics.|, I remember seeing this in the cinema when it came out with my mum as I usually didn't to the  cinema that often, and apart from a few jumps in the plot I absolutely loved it. I watched Lucy with my friends when that came out and someone behind me talked about how similar the films were, which was exactly my thoughts even down to similar cinematography, Morgan Freeman and the almost exact plot / ending. I said the same thing to my friends but was too embarrassed to talk to him about it. 

I am so surprised that it did so much worse with so many worse reviews and came out at similar times. I can remember Lucy being blank faced and seemingly random characters getting involved, but Trancendence focused much more on a set group of people from the person's past, so you could see the change.

Definitely going to watch both again!|, The world was not ready for this movie. Fantastic movie don't know why people didn't liked it.|, I just watched the movie today and i think it's way better than it's described in the receptions. The story is very cool and meaningful|, A very underrated movie. I really loved the trailer.|, I just saw this movie without knowing what I was going to expect and, i have to say, i'm now shocked how this had so many bad ratings in various websites and ""experts"" in movies. This movie is great, is beautiful, is pure genius. At the end of the movie you'll find yourself thinking about everything really. To me, this is more than Oscar material, this could e the movie of my life, only future will decide it.|, This movie is really amazing! The storyline, the characters, effects, logic, everything! Its truly amazing and people should watch it!|, Such a great film, certainly one I could watch over and over again. Great actors, brilliant story, superb effects..keeps you gripped throughout |, Not sure why some people perceive the movie negatively. To me this movie is incredible!. "

The perfectional CGI and the soundtracks that absolutely slaps. I will miss the Bayverse|, I don't care if people are gonna judge me, I love the movie series the way it is.

This is the best line in this movie and it still is 5 years later|, Transformers The Last Knight is a cinematic masterpiece because Michael Bay understands the power of using aspect ratios to evoke a feeling of terror and get the atmosphere of war very accurate. Easily the aspect ratios and blacks bars consistently changing every single shot are a testament to Michael Bay's unmatched talent as a director.|, “i wanna stay and i wanna fight them” and she litterally did nothing this whole movie|, When you realize Optimus was holding back the whole time.|, I honestly believe that Michael Bay has potential with these movies. He clearly had big ideas especially on this movie, which was obviously not translated well plot-wise. Those were really the only ones missing from these otherwise ambitious cinematic universe.|, The trailer is probably better than the actual movie|, I got a chance to watch the franchise over again a couple of weeks ago and honesly, I truly enjoyed it. The last knight for sure is one of my favorite out of the 5. I do however understand why people may have disliked it. I felt like two movies would of allowed more development and connection with the story and characters. They also completely disregarded certain things from the previous films. Overall, it's still a good movie to watch."

En revanche au début on entend dire que cela ne sers à rien de gagner des batailles sans la guerre mais un peu après vous parlez de la guerre de cent ans qui je le rappelle a été gagner par les Français.|, Pour l'Indochine c'est vachement plus complexe que présenté ici. Déjà il ne s'agit pas d'un soulèvement populaire, la situation politique était très instable à cause de plusieurs camps (famille) qui s'affrontent politiquement. Les français soutenaient un partie en particulier. Sauf que deux puissances voulaient faire tomber la France, les USA et l'URSS. Ils ont poussé à la révolte certaines parties du pays. Les manifestations qu'il y a peu avoir en France sont le fait du PCF entre autres, qui soutenait les communistes vietnamien. Les soldats Français se sont battus jusqu'au bout, faisant preuve d'un sacrifice hallucinant. Des soldats blessés et des soldats sans formation ont sauté en parachute au-dessus du champ de bataille pour aider les copains désemparés. A ce moment là le république avait déjà abandonné ses soldats à leur sort, aucun soutien politique. Suite à cette défaite, à peu près 20.000 soldats français ont été traînés dans des camps de la mort ou portés disparus.|, Après les 4 pires défaites, vous pourriez faire les quatre meilleurs victoires ?|, J'ai toujours considéré nos soldats comme des héros et le penserais toujours vive la France 🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵|, Napoléon a gagné plusieurs guerres (1796: 1ère Coalition, 1800: 2ème Coalitions, 1805: 3e Coalitions, 1806-1807: 4e Coalitions et 1809: 5e Coalition), il a juste perdu les 2 dernière"

And after a 12-minute standing ovation, I'm guessing most people went for dinner on their private yacht in Cannes and completely missed the point of the film, which tragically reinforces Ostlund's and the film's genius.|, When the movie hits the 2 hour mark and you go ""I wish this were a tv show so it wouldn't end"" you know it's a good movie.|, RIP Charlbi Dean. So sad she passed away so young just when this movie is debuting. And it looks brilliant. I cannot wait to watch it!! I love how so many other countries have the courage and obviously creative license to make movies like this, that clearly speak real truths and do so with cutting humor. This kind of film would never be made anymore in the US, and that is sad.|, This is the kind of movie that makes you believe in real cinema and to feel excited and luxurious to buy a ticket and pop corn any given afternoon of any given week after work.|, Just watched this movie. It lasts for more than two hours but I forgot about the time and was caught with the sudden ending. The true cinematography. I loved all the soundtracks, from recognizable radio hits to the metal song and the amazing edm song in the end! I just loved it. And what a sad loss of the leading actress...|, Just watched it at the New Zealand International Film Festival. THAT sequence provided one of the most vocal audience reactions I’ve heard in a while, the second act conclusion is just incredible stuff|, I work a customer service job on the upper west side of New York, and this is about to be my favorite film ever|, JUST WATCHED LAST NIGHT, ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I'VE SEEN, the plot, the twists, the acting, the music, everything was so perfect|, I kept growing in laughter, in awe of this film, as I sat on my plane home. Honestly an incredible masterpiece. I don't think I've chanced upon such great cinema in a long time.|, I first wanted to see this film for it's quirky satire and it's warning to the ultra-rich, now I'll see it because we lost a star which is her breakout role which is forever lost.

AM. IN. AWE. This movie is fucking amazing. I don't know with others but I love it! The narration was well-written, and the story of Ned Kelly was portrayed in a deeper sense.

Truman,Everything GREAT About The Truman Show!,dEzf8PDAz5w,713813,34802,1120,"For those saying that Truman will never get a moment of solitude, the ending where both guys' quick attention span cause them to change the channel is the right bow to cap off the gift of this storytelling.|, Fun fact:  When constructing her character's backstory, Laura Linney decided there was a clause in Meryl's contract that stipulated a $10,000 bump every time she and Truman had sex.|, I really wish they kept the deleted scenes where they reveal Marlon is extremely guilt ridden by what he has done to Truman becoming alcoholic and drug-addicted outside of the show. There's also a scene where he finds Truman at the end but decides to cover it up and let him escape. I think it would have helped flesh out how the actual cast is affected by this, especially those who have had to be there from the start.|, I did the “skip to the title card” thing with a friend who knew nothing about the movie. He figured out Truman was on TV when he walked into the elevator, but didn’t realise he’d been on TV his whole life and was the only one not in on it until they outright reveal it in the movie. It was fun watching him slowly put the pieces together!|, Fun Fact: Jim Carrey was getting tired of doing comedies and wanted to do a serious movie to show that he's not just a goofball.
And when he read the script for the Truman Show, he loved it so much that he agreed to do it for a fraction of what he normally charges.|, 8:48 It gets even better. The reason she has the makeup bib and comes into the room all flustered is because they had to get the actress ready unexpectedly and in a rush. They never expected Truman to show up at the travel agency considering all the work they put into scaring him out of ever traveling, by sea (father’s death) or plane (radio announcement about the falling stage light, poster on the travel agency wall, etc.) Truly, this film is a masterpiece.|, About that ""killing Marlon"" thing: there are actually two cut scenes from the movie that would have made him more likable.
The first is a scene where the producers and Christof are talking about what to do when Truman has a child, and they want to move to a two-channel setup - one channel devoted to Truman himself, the other to his child. Then Marlon, in a tone of voice that tells you he really isn't okay with this, says ""So, if Truman dies, we go back to the one channel?""
 The second is near the ending, when the search party is looking for Truman. Marlon actually finds him, in a disguise. Truman looks at Marlon, scared. Marlon looks at him for a few seconds, then turns around, and yells ""Truman?! Where are you?!"", letting Truman escape.
I understand why they didn't put these scenes in the movie, but I would have still liked to see it.|, Okay, but can we talk about what a mind-blowing series finale the in-universe Truman Show had? 

Truman starts breaking the fourth wall, tries to escape, talks to God, says his catchphrase one last time, and exits stage right. He even takes a literal bow for the audience.

10/10, best ending ever, both in-universe and out.|, 11:55 - Upon rewatch I've come to interpret Truman's response to Marlin's line as the gut-wrenching realization that Marlin just inadvertently confirmed that he is indeed in on the ruse. Once he came to realize that, Truman knew that *no one* could be trusted. Not even his conveniently returned father.|, This movie will always have a profound yet horrifyingly existential place in my heart, it was the second movie I saw Jim Carrey in (after the Grinch) and it just confirmed how much of a treasure he is to humanity"

I will actually cheer if he wins best actor but I think it is Leo's year.|, I worked with Bryan not too long ago. He is literally one of the nicest/most humble humans on earth. He made it a point to engage in conversation with everyone on set, even the lowest intern on the crew totem pole. Kudos to him. But also, this looks amazing.|, Bryan Cranston is such a good actor that I don't see a glimpse of Walter White or Heisenberg here, he is genius!|, This movie is hella underrated, really deserves more recognition.|, Not only it looks like a great movie, but it's also an important movie due to what it's all about|, Bryan Cranston is a powerhouse of acting. We are gradually seeing his talents being unleashed. We need his more movies.|, Bryan Cranston is bound to win an Oscar soon! Trumbo will be nominated for best picture. I can't wait to see it! He made Malcom in the middle a show you wanted to watch because of him and has had a very steady and well developed climb to where he has arrived to today. I love everything he does and so does everyone else. He's one of the most brilliant and addicting actors to watch on any screen.|, If you haven't seen Trumbo, you are missing out on one of the most underrated dramatic based on true events stories ever, and the cast is simply superb|, Perfect cast, perfect plot, perfect wit, perfect genre no cheesiness and therefore a perfect movie|, This looks like a role that could land Bryan Cranston an Academy Award nomination and possibly even a win."

Pregnancy is so challenging, but if you really try to work together its less stressful. A woman goes through so so much having  a baby, and its never the same with anyone. This was a great film, thanks to all of the actors and creative team who created it.|, Charlize is never afraid to do something different and real in her movies. No matter how 'ugly' she might look, when the promotional event begin, she always dress to an elegant and gorgeous woman..so we often left in awe, ""is this really the same woman?"" Remarkable.|, The trailer says nothing about the movie! The movie is unbelievably amazing! I am so glad I watched it!"

Movies like Flu, The Host, The Tower, Train to Busan, Deranged, Tidal Wave, etc. All amazing and full of suspense.|, i watched this movie, honestly— it was suspense, it held a lot of potential and it made me cry. The trailer was worth watching and the movie itself too. I loved it so much.|, Bae Doona can always make me cry. Her acting is always so good.|, I enjoyed watching this movie because despite of the intense being trapped under a tunnel, the main actor had a few hilarious moments he did by himself. 5/5 Highly recommended|, I watched this movie a while ago. I didn't watched the trailer first and became hesitant if it's worth watching. But only a couple of minutes in and it already caught my attention. Awesome movie as always Koreans! If you want to feel the thrill again just like you experienced in Train to Busan, I highly recommend you this!|, Eu vi esse filme ...realmente é muito bom ! Muito emocionante !|, I watched this movie one month ago with my father and it was so freacking badass and emotional ! One of the best movie that i have never seen.|, Really amazing movie.

Turbo Kid,TURBO KID - Official Release Trailer [HD],AFlZ6pVtnv0,1922802,13860,878,"Absolutely ADORED this movie! One of the most fun times I've had watching a movie in quite awhile and I can see myself watching this over and over again. The character of ""Apple"" may be one of my favorite characters ever in a movie. Every time she was on screen I found myself smiling from ear to ear (or laughing hysterically!). Michael Ironside did his usual awesome job as playing the bad guy and he chews up every scene that he's in. The comic book style gore is absolutely insane and amazing (think the ""Black Knight"" scene in MPATHG done over and over again but each time in a different way). And the retro-synth soundtrack was fantastic. Was it over the top? YES! Was it utterly unbelievable?? YES!! Was it fun as hell??? YES!!! Put your brain on hold for 90 minutes, put this awesome movie on next time you get a chance (it's on Shudder), and get ready for a blast of a time!|, Watched it a couple of months ago and since has stole my heart. You guys deserve praise what you achieved with a limited budget. Awesome cast, awesome soundtrack and most of all, an awesome movie. Proud to have this movie in my collection!|, This movie is made for us 35-45 years olds. It is a love letter to our childhood. BMX, scavenge hunts, superheros, comic books, NES, first love, facing reality and finding out it is a brutal world and to survive you have to be brutal. steeping over yourself wining but loosing it all and moving on. I absolute adore this movie. I wish Epic would actually release it on Laser disk. After all they are #1 seller of laser disks:)) That would be super awesome.|, Everything about this movie is incredible. Love the soundtrack. Watched it on Netflix, but gonna buy  a physical copy (hopefully in VHS) .Seriously, it now belongs in my top 10 favorites of all time.|, As a man from America who loves global filmmaking, I was so happy to see this film. It's absolutely fantastic to see that Canadian cinema is starting to get international acclaim, and it helps to introduce a lot of great unheard of talent. I did not expect this much heart in a movie of this kind.|, A post-apocalypse film where people ride bikes? This is the most logical thing ever!

I love the indie comic. Those were some of the best comics out there.

And I'm totally watching this.|, I desperately need more movies like this! I totally loved it! <3|, Absolutely awesome movie, definitely a huge favourite of mine, which drives you over the edge and never lets go. Pure fantasy in the extreme, I loved it!|, Seriously underated film ! I love it , the music the characters, that 80s vibe is captured perfectly !!! Not to mention the awsome enviroment they created , genuinely funny moments and crazy gore fx ! One of the most enjoyable films ive seen over the last 10 years|, Saw this at the new DBZ film airing. Looks absolutely awesome. The world needs more 80s synths, cool missions, and purposely nonsensical magic."

Very satisfying movie, well-scripted, and has great storytelling. Hats off to the Director, producers, casting, and actors as well.|, I love Sandler in this movie. You freaking hate him and root for him at the same time. He is so annoying yet you can’t help but feel sorry for him. Great film|, I hope to see Adam take on more future serious roles like the one in Uncut Gems. He was bloody brilliant. The entire crew did an amazing job.|, I literally almost stepped out of the theater because of how stressful this movie is, I felt like I was gunna puke. But holy cow this movie is awesome.|, Nothing is going to recreate the experience of seeing this the first time.|, I’m really happy that Adam Sandler is breaking boundaries. Showing that he’s much more than comedy movies.|, Intense, heart racing, and get you really anxious and uncomfortable. However a masterpiece, enjoyed it.|, Watched this at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto when it came out and the whole crowd was engaged and active, laughing and shocked at the necessary parts.

It’s definitely not for everyone but I have no shame in saying that this is on the top 3 best A24 movies.|, Looks wonderful and I'm IN 🤗|, A24 is saving the movie industry one movie at a time.|, First time in my life after watching a movie, I was not able to make my mind on if I enjoyed watching the film or I didn't. One things for sure, I couldn't stop thinking about it after watching it. Such an odd ball of a movie with Noir pace and crazy revelations. Everywhere the character goes in search of answers, we are with him and trying to figure out like him that WTF is actually going on.

Underworld: Blood Wars,UNDERWORLD: BLOOD WARS - Official Trailer (HD),rKHL5PyAPzs,6929023,19291,1586,"The *Underworld* franchise is always going to be unique to me.  It's one of the very few _Vampire/Lycan_ stories that don't try to insult my intelligence.  The visuals and designs are really great.  The characters learn over time and adapt.  There's actually an *origin* story that seems plausible and antagonists that aren't stupid; having a legit reason why they're doing what they're doing. [_case-in-point_, *Lucian*] - *Kraven* was an asshole, but at least he was a cleverly deceitful one.

Now, the only thing I'm interested in, are Michael and Eve.  Why create something amazing then just ignore it?  It doesn't make sense, considering it's important for Selene too.  Think about it, Selene could potentially become an *Elder* for a new generation of Vampires.  She's the bridge for the Old and New; their daughter Eve and Michael could then become the Leaders of the Coven.  You could call it, ""The New Covenant"".

I'm still not sure about the Lycans yet, I'd have to think about it.|, I have been a long time fan of this franchise since the first movie. Of course this film is going to chase the action packed  and new enemy like the ones before it with Selene spearheading the movies minus the prequel because it's what makes Underworld, Underworld. It's one of those badass films you go see and expect it to be like it's predecessors instead of something else and walk out satisfied just like other film franchises such as Pirates of the Caribbean. On another note, I agree with others on here ""Where is Michael and when is he coming back?"" Even if it's not the same actor, please throw us a bone or two other than the ending of the last movie because I was a bit pissed that there was this build up and that he was going to be on the roof and reunited with his wife and daughter and that Selene would be kissing him, but no....so please bring him back somehow...|, I can't wait! Looks action packed as always. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful and badass. She needs to be in Marvel or DC film!|, Theo James is evolving into a very good actor. So convincing! I wish we see more of him.|, Please another Underworld. No prequel… Keep it going! This was a dope film and I would love to see Celine at the head with her new powers doing what she does best!|, Love these movies ❤️ hope the journey never ends 🎆|, This is such a good movie!😀 If Kate Beckinsale doesn't return in the next one then please at least there be one more movie with a replacement actress and with Eve being a more active character!😀 And perhaps with Eve being the main protagonist character in the tv series who as a hybrid initiates a peace treaty between the Vampire and Lycan clans!😀 Now, how about a rogue vampire-Lycan hybrid as the villain in the next movie and tv series!😀 I was hoping that Micheal would survive Marius' twisted dissection experimentation on him so that he would make it into the next movie but I guess that's just wishful thinking. If Micheal's dead then I'm so fucking pissed that Marius killed him especially since he never got to see and talked to his daughter before he died!😡|, OMG! I can't wait for this to come out, absolutely love this movie franchise!|, Who still has hope for a 6 movie? I do|, Awesome movie as always can't wait for the next sequel :D"

Unfriended,Unfriended - Official Trailer (HD),Lgj4GjqCFlY,10796345,53589,9402,"this is exactly how the internet functions|, This movie was actually really well made and creepy. The trailer makes it look cheesy and stupid, but I watched it last night and it was very realistic and eye catching. Finally, an original horror movie.|, The thing is this movie has a good message 

“Your memories stay on the internet forever, but so do your mistakes”|, I remember watching this movie in theater in college and it freaked the shit out of me at the time. This was when webcams were becoming popular. I rewatched this on Netflix recently and it’s still frightens me to this day. I think it’s the whole paranormal aspect of the film. The premise kind of reminds me of 13 reasons why.|, This is such a great concept for a horror movie. This is an age where everyone uses skype and uses the net to shame others. It's something we always read or hear about which further adds to the realism and relatability, and the fact that the ghost actually has a decent reason to kill makes you want to root for them even more. I really hope it's executed well. I've been looking forward to a decent horror flick for years now.|, This movie is seriously soooo satisfying to watch. The Bullies get Bullied in such a way that satisfies the viewers esp to those who were bullied in their life but moved on being a good person. It gives such a satisfaction that these MFs in the movie so called good person.......You know what just enjoy the movie. It's worth it! I watched it back to back just to enjoy it further more!|, Tbh, this actually looks pretty good. Bullying actually leads to suicide in son occasions, so its actually teaching you a lesson. Dont cyber bully people. Or you'll get your hand stuck in a blender|, That moment when you empathize more with the ghost than the main characters, you go Laura!!!|, Saw this last year with my mom and (then 12) sister. She was freaked out during the whole thing and at one point she got a call from an unknown number and started crying. We were literally the only people in the entire auditorium that day.|, Hot take but, this movie is amazing. It tackles issues that we actually have right now. People say the acting is bad, and i both agree and disagree. The actors did an awesome job portraying the characters as realistic as possible, although I do think it's lacking in some places. Overall i think this movie gets a rating of 7.5/10"

In the first Unfriended movie, a ghost was the one killing the characters, and the film itself is generally seen as pretty bad. In this one, it seems to focus more on the horror of your home being invaded, being kidnapped, etc. As such it hits closer to home, as this could actually theoretically happen|, The scene with the hospitalized mom is pure evil.|, I've got a feeling that I've watched a whole movie in the trailer.|, You've never experienced true fear like this one! A family member dying in a hospital, intruders entering your home, lights going out, dark secrets, man it gives me chills.|, This is actually underrated. It’s not a perfect movie of course, but I like the creativity and the tension during the whole thing|, Well is trailer saved me a movie ticket ,and popcorn ... i pretty much watched it 😂|, “Dude this is dark web!”
This is obviously going to be the pinnacle of accuracy|, I'm feeling very sad for that poor mom like how she got dragged into this all while fighting through her own sickness in the Hospital
RIP|, I hope we get an ""Unfriended 3"" someday. This time taking place on Zoom. Maybe it can take elements from both movies of supernatural elements and the Dark Web. Maybe we can see the Circle from this movie back and they're deciding what to do next with kidnapping and killing new victims. However, their call is being haunted by one of their deceased victims as revenge. With this, the ghost victim will post everything the Charon's had done including exposing them for framing the victims in this movie to make everyone think they were the killers even though they were innocent."

I didn't think it was gonna be a really good movie,  but how well Russell acted just sucked me in 👏|, I like this idea: a thriller based around a common annoyance.|, I love this so much. The look on someone's face when they realize how stupid they are is priceless. The world isnt rainbows and lolipops and your mouth can put you in a nightmare situation that could have been avoided. People never learn.|, She drove everywhere except to a police station. 🤦🏽‍♀️|, I am half way through this movie and i can now say that I will think twice about honking rudely at someone. I will have more patience on the road because this movie was honestly terrifying.|, Scariest man is the person who has nothing to lose for in his life|, Lessons in this movie:
""Don't do to others what you don't want others do unto you.""
""Between being kind and being right, always choose kindness.""
""Be kind to others, you do not know what others are going through.""
""Humble yourself so apologize if you must. Pride & ego always have its cons."""
Unplanned,Unplanned Official Trailer - In Theaters March 29,gBLWpKbC3ww,5546994,50401,12473,"My mom was 17 drug addicted and already had my sister when she was 16 back in '76. Doctors, aunts, even my gramma urged her to get an abortion. After all, she is why abortions where legalized, the young drug addicted alcoholic women who had been raped. Well, she kept me it was a nightmare. I was taken away when i was 3 and raised in a pretty abusive home anyways. But im okay and i cant imagine a world without me. I stopped a guy from killing him self when i was 20. He has kids now and lives a fully realized life. I have more then once stopped a creep trying to assault a woman, and once saved a young girl who had fallen off a cliff into the ocean i didnt hesitate i jumped the cliff and saved her. Point is, God found good purposes for me. Im not very handsome or particularily intellegent but im smart enough to know God needed me and  so i live my life knowing that i need God. Thanks mom . r.i.p.|, I'm most of the way through this.. im a 39 year old, burly beafy 6 foot man who's also a  full time single father to a beautiful 3 year old boy. And I am crying like I've never cried before.  To whoever had any part of the making of this, thank you.|, My sister and I ""we are twins"" and my two brothers were adopted and I'm so happy because my parents were the best. I wouldn't change them for anything|, I was standing at the counter and I just could not do it, I’m due in November and it’s been hard but I couldn’t imagine not having my little girl alive in me and getting to hold her next to me.|, I am pro-choice. However, I am currently pregnant and 7 weeks today. I just had an ultrasound and the last time I saw my baby was 4w5d. Then, I couldn’t see anything but a sac. In just 2 weeks my baby has grown to a jelly bean like blob on a ultrasound screen. I got to see his little heart beat. I cried. I cried tears of joy. He’s gotten so big in just a couple weeks. It made me think of what a miracle I have been blessed with. 

It also has made me see abortion in a new light. This is incredible. The growth of a baby from a tiny spec to someone that will one day have their own features and mind and goals is amazing. I will forever be pro-life for myself. I hope other mothers could feel the same as I do.|, Years ago,my cousin had plenty abortions so I judged harshly.I wondered how she got herself into such a mess.How she got deceived by a man.Later on in life,same thing happened to ""naive me.""I got fooled too Even after using birth control,it still happened.The Baby was terminated.It may have the best wrong option at that time but it left me psychologically tortured for life.Because I had no right to destroy a life.I hope God can still forgive me|, I remember when I was a teen that my sex education was with a gynecology book, because my mother is a doctor and I have been aware of how abortions were done. I had my unplanned baby at 21 and she is the light of my life, and for her I found out I can do things that before I thought I couldn't, she pushed me to succeed.|, My uncle and his fiance just had a baby boy. He is such a blessing in these hard times with the coronavirus. His birth has strengthened my passion for being pro life. Thinking that thousands of babies like my cousin are killed everyday just kills me. My soon to be aunt went through over a day of labor and pain, but from the moment my cousin was born she was smiling. Every life deserves to have a chance. Seeing so many people in the world try to justify killing these innocent angels just makes me sick..|, My mom was asked by our doctor if she wanted to keep this unplanned human. She denied it, kept me and raised me. Today she is completely blind, and she doesn’t know what she would do without me taking care of her. She always says if I wasn’t here she would already be dead. Saving one life can continue to save more lives.|, saw this in theathers, in canada, where all the major distributors refused to allow it in, but some smaller ones did. Needless to say, this movie can make a grown man cry."
Unsane,UNSANE | Official Trailer,u7KZrt_cHH0,19877109,28127,2918,"Absolutely wild how this entire movie was filmed on an iPhone. This is an intelligent indie film that flew way under the radar. A must watch for any psychological horror fan.|, Excellent movie and Claire Foy absolutely nailed her part.  I’m a nurse and I’ve also been a patient in a locked ward “for my own safety”....I had a breakdown after my dad died suddenly, two friends died within 3 months of my dad dying and their deaths...all unexpect - heart attacks and suicide.  Then I was driving home from the shops, ( I live in the Scottish highlands and my closest shop is 8 miles away), and I found a dying motorcyclist on the road and he died in my arms.....this was 6 months after the other deaths.  I was fine for a wee while but finally I broke and was admitted to hospital.  Anyway, seeing Claire Foy act in this movie was something that brought back memories but she did an amazing job of not cheapening the part of a mentally ill person.  She was fantastic in The Girl In The Spider’s Web too.  I really enjoyed this movie and I rarely leave comments about films I’ve watched, but this was one where I didn’t get bored or fidgety halfway through and that’s rare for me!|, This movie was phenomenal. It starts out slow, but it eventually picks up. The plot was absolutely gripping.|, This is significant. Soderbergh will potentially inspire a new wave of young filmmakers by showing them that you don’t need a fancy camera to make a great movie. The potential effects of this movie are very exciting.|, I actually watched a full youtube ad without skipping for once. 10/10 would watch again.|, This is an incredible movie if you are into psychological thrillers I HIGHLY recommend it.|, I worked at a mental health facility and I can assure you, this shit happens. Not to everyone, but the details in this trailer were impeccable. People dont understand what they are signing, people call the cops and we tell them, ""that happens every day, they arent coming"", asshole staff, people claiming other patients were stalkers, etc. Jesus this took me back.|, This is one of the most well done and original trailers for a movie I’ve seen recently. Definitely gonna see this one|, One of my favorite movies of 2018. Love psychological thrillers.|, Amazing movie.
About stalkers and mental institutions. 

Great acting by
Claire Foy."

Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets Official Trailer - Teaser (2017) - Movie,NNrK7xVG3PM,10453584,62720,6132,"This movie has the absolute most incredible alien designs that I have ever seen! That aqua planet in the opening was absolutely gorgeous!|, I love this trailer. I saw it once then went and read all the comics. I also love the weirdness that is this movie, I understand that its story is really not that great, but the world-building and strange Luc Besson-ishness makes it a very special hidden gem.|, I’ve seen this like 6-7times now and I like it more every time. You could tell Luc Besson was tryin to cram so much into it that it felt rushed at times, but the potential is what excites me. Unless we as a race actually meet aliens soon, then this would be a great show or series of movies to keep goin for a while. Great universe and story design.|, I love this movie so much!! Not only did the comics inspire some of the most influential series, shows and characters we have today but it was the first movie I saw with my long distance boyfriend! Tonight we’re watching it together as our two year wedding anniversary! 💙✨|, A lot of you guys don't even know that this Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets inspired Star Wars and many other sci-fi books and movies. I'm not saying this movie is gonna be good or bad, but just know that the graphic novel inspired many of the things we watch and read today. Give this movie a chance, I will|, That's a perfect trailer! No spoilers or plot elements and perfect presentation of the movie's topic/genre, mood, atmosphere. I love it!

Edit: The music fits really good!|, I loved the Fifth Element. Yes, some parts were silly, but that is what made it so endearing. I loved this movie because it follows the same concept. The visual effects are awesome and there are beautiful characters like Bubble and the Pearl people.  The whole technological concept is very innovative and futuristic. I wish some of those technologies were available now.|, I love this movie!  Watched it several times including again tonight.  I think it's quite well done and engaging. They are military partners subtly growing into a couple at the end.|, My grandfather gave me a Valerian graphic novel as a gift once, and it was the one comic that really stuck with me. The artstyle, theming and everything else was just such an interesting blend of old tropes mixed with some fascinating storytelling that just enthralled me. It felt a bit like Fifth Element, Star Wars, and Guardians of the Galaxy, but with a slightly less whimsical mood to it. I'm really excited for this, but I'm not hugely impressed by the casting right now - I'm not sure how Dale DeHaan will be in a role like that of a Valerian - he looks like a kid, but Valerian always reminded me of a stony-faced, die-hard action hero. Definitely looked more like Superman-era Christopher Reed to me...|, This movie absolutely needs a sequel. Absolutely.  I think the thing that star wars did that this movie didn't, was incorporate more characters with which to easily build sequels with. The sequel to this one could roll off at the end of this one, but we need more characters to fall in love with. There were some poorly acted moments in this film, from the main character opening scene to the female voiceover who does the safety check at Alpha Station (basically an extra), but despite it's small flaws, the world this movie takes place in is phenomenal and the effects are top notch, every bit as good as star wars in that department."

Vampire Academy,Vampire Academy | Official Trailer | Peacock Original,Gw_xrllOGu0,2456879,13729,1189,"Vampire Academy was the very first fiction book I read. It cultivated my love for reading. It opened a whole new world for me - it started with vampires, wizards and witches, and now historical fiction. This story has a special place in my heart. I loved the actors in the movie but the movie was such a disappointment. I'm not familiar with these new actors but I hope they give justice to the characters the fans loved. But based on this trailer, they are not the characters we loved and it also feels like they're telling a different story.|, Did anyone else notice Rose's and Dimitri's perfect synchronization at 1:44? That's how I always imagined their movements in the book, perfect mirrors of each other.|, Me arrepio toda vez que vejo essas cenas, ficou muito massa cara e a música casou tão bem|, I just hope we get to see Adrian! He’s literally one of my favorite characters!|, I always wanted to see Rose interact with Adrian (from the books) but from the look of this… I don’t think the show will ever get to that 😂|, Not sure about this. I don’t care how the actors look or if the plot is changed but what I do care is that the vibe of the show and actors matches the vibe of the books and characters. And when I look at this I don’t see the Vampire academy at all, I see something completely different. The actors also don’t give me the vibe of their characters, the closest is probably the girl that plays Lissa. And based on Dimitri’s one line to Rose here in the trailer… I see zero chemistry between them and zero emotions on his face, he looks so bland? I also don’t see the chemistry between Rose and Lissa, so idk what Julie was thinking with this cast.
UPDATE: I’m actually pleasantly surprised after watching the first 5 episodes… the trailer didn’t do it justice.|, Não tenho nem palavras pra descrever o quanto eu amei isso❤️😭|, Yay! I'm super excited to see one of my favorite series come to life like this! It looks fantastic!|, I cannot wait for Sep 15. I've read the whole series twice and have always wanted it to become a movie. Then I saw the movie and cried. I know the series will be somewhat different but this trailer to me is bringing life to the books. I am beyond excited.|, I’m so glad this book has finally been made into a TV series!"
Vanguard,Vanguard UK Release New Funds &amp; Why I’ve Changed My Portfolio,NSj7CMSulqA,22800,1018,152,"If you like my videos then you’ll love our FREE weekly Market Roundup. I send it out each Friday and it’s packed full of interesting insights and a roundup of the news that’s most relevant for investors https://pensioncraft.com/market-roundup/|, Funnily enough, I have just swapped my Vanguard fund from Distribution to accumulation. I did note that there wasn't much in the way of money in the fund but I am sure that will grow as soon as other see the offerings.|, wasn't it mostly Emerging Markets and UK that hurt the Global All Caps fund, not the small Cap tilt? Because the Global Small Caps funds returned a solid 12% past 10 years, but Emerging Markets and UK didn't|, Vanguard also charges a hidden ""transaction fee"" on their funds. The Invesco etf doesn't but it samples fewer companies also|, Excellent video as always Ramin. As you mentioned sometimes it's cheaper to hold vanguard funds on different investing platforms - could you do a platform comparison video? Your previous video about this is a few years old now and fees/charges have changed.|, Im the opposite, I prefer dividend etfs or stocks, lower maintenance is not an issue for me because I enjoy keeping record, but I like to reinvest dividends from one part of my portfolio into another. Also easier to hold a dividend etf, which will likely still pay some dividend during severe downturns, increasing the amount of cash I have for reinvestment at the best time.|, Nice video Ramin. The only thing that could be added to this video is to use example portfolio and show how much money investor would save by switching to funds with cheaper fees. Cutting 0.1% in fees does not sound as convincing as X number of punds saved over time.|, Moneymarket funds are not protected and not zero risk. I heard someone warning they would be vulnerable if there was a sudden move away from MMFs  if interest rates dropped. Yellen I think.|, One can avoid the ERI problem of accumulation ETFs by selling and rebuyıng just before and after the date at which ERI accrues to the holder. This also ensures gains are taxed at capital gains tax rates, rather than dividend tax rates. This is often more than enough of a benefit to make up for the bid/offer spread loss when selling and repurchasing.|, Many income ETFs also have Excess Reportable Income. So one does not avoid this tax reporting complication by buying only income ETFs. This fact seems to be little known. Many investors do not know how to look up the ERI of their fund holdings."

Venom: Let There Be Carnage,VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE - Official Trailer (HD),-ezfi6FQ8Ds,36348360,766382,34495,"Love him or hate him, but we all can appreciate that Venom is at least trying to help around the house|, For anyone who cares, Venom's love of chocolate actually goes beyond the flavor. 

Symbiotes need a chemical called phenethylamine to survive. This chemical is found in the human brain, hence symbiotes being known to frequently eat people's heads. However, there is also a small amount of phenethylamine in chocolate. So, in the comics, Eddie fed Venom mass amounts of chocolate so that he didn't have to eat people's heads on the daily.

(Edit: Sorry if I sound like a know-it-all. I'm not trying to be. I was just sharing a fun fact for anyone who cares.)|, I love how Eddie just accepts venom doing his thing and is basically like “Alright, i don’t even care about the food. I’m just gonna sit down with my orange juice. You ruined this whole shit for me”|, Love and hate how venom isnt scary anymore he is just a friend to people|, Venom making Eddie breakfast is the cutest and funniest thing I’ve ever seen|, To everyone saying Venom is supposed to be a villain, venom actually is not. Growing up playing all the games and watching all the movies, I can put it this way. Venom originally wanted to kill Spiderman and destroy everything he loved. That's all Venom wanted. Eventually in his time fighting, Venom started to simply stray away from being like a villain to stay alive which led to less killing and more ""protecting"" others. Between these two Venom movies, they basically nail that plot perfectly, while giving it a more fun and modern action packed style. Venom was never really considered a true villain, nor a hero. Venom is just Venom.

(Aka yes, sort of an anti-hero). He tries to do right for his own sake, but sometimes it doesn't end up as it should|, Like him or hate him we can all appreciate the fact that venom is atleast trying to help around the house.|, Eddie sounds so betrayed when he says “we had a deal.” 😂|, I love how the cashier went to screaming in fear at venom to saying “Good evening venom.”|, I love the fact that Mrs. Chen knows about and is perfectly fine with Venom. Granted, he _did_ save her from being constantly robbed, so that probably has something to do with it even if it involved the Klyntar eating him right in front of her.

Worried about how trigger happy he suddenly is on hunting though."

I'm still rooting for Logan and Veronica, I mean hey their story was epic. Am I right or am I right? |, When the movie ended i felt like it was a pilot for a new season.  Damn, i just can't get enough of Veronica Mars. I really need new seasons.|, This movie was just phenomenal. As a fan of the show, it was a little more enjoyable to me because you've gotten to know the characters more and there are so easter eggs that make it all the more fun to watch. BUT, if you haven't seen the show, they do a great job with making sure everyone's caught up to a point where they can all enjoy the movie equally. Maybe some more than others ;). I highly recommend this for anyone who's interested in comedy, crime, drama, mystery, etc. You won't (or shouldn't) be disappointed with the outcome. 
I will say, I probably have seen the movie more than a dozen times and could probably quote the whole thing but there is still AT LEAST 2 parts (no spoilers) that make me jump. And I'm even anticipating them!|, As someone who has watched the first 2 seasons of this show I can def say this shaping up to be the movie I've been wanting to see.|, This looks really good I'm glad they were able to make this happen after all these years.|, You have no idea how excited I am for this movie! |, I can't wait. I've been keeping up with the Veronica Mars film from day 1. My problem is, didn't we all love the cliffhangers at the end of EVERY episode? The long, ongoing plots?

Wisdom is knowing that Frankenstein is the monster.""|, James McAvoy what a great talent, i really don't understand why we don't see him in more movies|, This film portrayed the mad scientist well. Everyone had a little madness to them, that's what made it so thrilling. Victor was truly a mad genius here|, Poor Daniel Radcliffe.  No one will ever truly be able to see him as anyone other than Harry Potter.|, This looks like just a fun movie with a good cast. It looks like one of those movies that's not going to make you think deeply about something, it's just going to entertain you for 2 hours.|, Went to see this purely because of Andrew Scott and found myself enjoying the WHOLE film enormously! I love the sense of humour and banter in it and, my God, the acting was brilliant. So good, I'd watch it again loads of times. Definitely recommend it!|, My personal favorite take on the age old monster character.This film is just visually and conceptually stunning. Decorated with the dashing and prolific performance by James MaCavoy and endearing characterization of Daniel Radcliffe played just perfectly. The set pieces and soundtrack is apt for the era the story is set in.|, This movie was actually really good! Very entertaining! It would be so awesome if they made a sequel with those two detectives as Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law.|, Will anyone actually ever make a Frankenstein movie that's an actual adaption of the book?|, I love these two as actors and as people. I really hope it ends up being a good movie :)"
Victoria & Abdul,VICTORIA &amp; ABDUL - Official Trailer [HD] - In Theaters 9/22,T504u17Ao9A,7688974,67516,3175,"Queen Victoria was not happy for a very long time after her husband died, but when Abdul came around, it opened up a friendship between to humans, that made her happy and brings a smile to my face for no other reason but just a pure organic without incentive friendship. I am glad given her loneliness she was able to get that him from him.|, It's sad to know that, after queen died they threw Abdul back to India and burnt all the records of him.
But still their friendship is still alive. 
May their souls be happy in heaven.❤️|, This movie looks beautiful and I am super excited to see it. I teared up when Victoria touched on how she’s outlived everyone she loves, and Abdul gives her the hope she needs. I never knew about Abdul, and I am excited to get to know him and how he helped Queen Victoria.|, Abdul Karim Respected Her Highness As His Mother. Queen Victoria Loved Him As Her Son.|, I hope people will see this movie beyond political thoughts. Put hatred aside. See the beauty and love within a forbidden friendship of an old woman and a young man. It is indeed very beautiful to see beyond race, religion, and status and freely love one another.|, Judy is just pure magic in whatever she does. Fantastic cast and a wonderful true story|, I watched a documentary about this she loved him like her son and couldn't no one say anything bad about him she was always on his side until the day she died and her family and other aristocrats kicked him and his family out of his house that the queen gave him and burned anything that had the royal crest on it  including every letter she ever wrote to him they basically tried to erase him from history because they hated him so much it's quite sad; and because  they took all three of the homes the queen gifted him he returned to India he passed I believe 4 years after the queen|, I love that Judi Dench played the role of Queen Victoria before in Mrs Brown, and now plays the role again in this movie. She truly aged with the character|, Love how people made the movie because it is one of the infamous thing in history|, Such a great story! Such a great movie! Such a great history! ❤️"

Violent Night,Violent Night - Official Trailer,a53e4HHnx_s,40536876,145328,10647,"Based on the trailer alone I think we can reasonably state that this might be one of the, if not THE greatest Christmas film ever made 🙃|, This movie is great.  It manages to be heartwarming and violent at the same time.|, I saw this last night. It's so good.

It's violent and bloody, and yet somehow still an utterly sincere Christmas movie.

As Santa might say, it's Christmas magic, but I'm not really sure how it works.|, Saw this today. Was freaking awesome. 

Fun. Properly paced. Good character dialogue. Great action. Santa had a perfect character arc. Knew what kind of movie it wanted to be, and f'ing nailed it.|, I don't know how this movie manages to be both stunningly creative in it's violence (Die Hard mixed with Home Alone is definitely is a perfect description if I've ever heard one) and surprisingly heartwarming and sincere. It knows how to have fun while hitting you straight in the feels. Loved it, 10/10 would highly recommend :)|, By far, the best christmas movie ever! The casts, plot, dialogue, action, it's all absolutely marvelous!|, I'm so glad this isn't just some parody video or an SNL sketch. I genuinely would love to just see a campy, violent Santa Claus film that doesn't take itself too seriously but is still a quality action film. This looks like its gonna be hilarious and awesome. Much needed. Feels almost like a throwback to comedy of a dozen years ago or so.|, I just got home from seeing this, I love it. It was corny, heartwarming, funny, action packed & gruesome. Honestly, go watch it.|, I definitely need to see this - David Harbor as Santa?  Yes, please!  I'm not sure how they managed to make this feel wholesome  and kickass at the same time, but I love it!  ^_^|, Just watched this Monday afternoon. Such a great movie! It was fun and I laughed my ass off😂Perfectly gory with just enough sentiment. David Harbour was absolutely perfect for this role. Cannot wait to see it again! I’ll absolutely be buying this."

Thank you again for another amazing song Wonpil, Day6. I can't stop listening the whole playlist! 
I can't stop wishing Day6 finally get recognition that they more deserve than now. They all genius as singer, musician, and song writer. Not many artist out there able resonate to people through their works. The works that speaks itself their greatness, and Day6, Wonpil have it|, I now know why JYP appreciated him most out of all the artists in the company, I mean he deserves it! He got everything.

You see her for who she really is. A pied piper of the devil who's leading these people to their doom. And they are doing it smiling, singing, and dancing. Bewitched by her pop music. That shot of Jude Law watching her really is so disturbing in that context.|, Went in with no expectations, now it’s in my top 10.|, I watch this trailer just to study it. It's so well put together.|, Loved it!!!|, This is like a spiritual sequel of black swan 😂|, This tralier is amazing truly|, This movie should only exist as the trailer.|, Fear not my sisters,  Your Supreme Commander will guard you <3|, This has nothing to do with a violent tragedy and everything to do with how people get fucked up from popularity and greed.|, Can't believe the same dude that played Alan Tracy directed this film!"
Voyagers,"Voyagers (2021 Movie) Official Trailer – Tye Sheridan, Lily-Rose Depp",EwJkexUBSeg,2375150,13346,1034,"i just love psy-fi movies, they do it in such an intelligent way, always something new to find out from different director's perspective..i also like the little fantasy, psycho-thriller in it, this is just my best genre to watch, when i watch it i don't need friendly kisses, i only need to imagine more and more when it ends|, I thought this movie would suck since I never heard of it and it's based on young teens. I don't understand the bad reviews, acting was very very good and CGI and camera work. The music was good and it relates with how humans are and how politics are like back on earth. Like someone said it's like that book called LORD OF THE FLIES. I'm a big movie buff and I might say it will be on my top 10 favorites. IF YOU HAVE KIDS, please make them watch this so they can learn how the future can be and how this country is being run from idiots as my posting is from  mid summer 2021. I give it a 8/10. I JUST LOVE THE FEAR TACTICS used in this movie and how it relates.

This ain't no cheap indie movie and I already can guarantee the 3 or so main stars in this movie will be future stars.|, It's a bit like 'Lord of the flies' in space!! Really good film, a lot better than I expected! 😀|, This was a really great written and directed film, I really feel Christopher represents what we need to be and leadership and someone who has their head on straight in this mad world. Thank you for this film.😃|, Great movie. I felt like it was a metaphor for today’s society.|, Would have been any amazing Netflix show.|, Love when the trailer explains the whole movie|, So... An entire spaceships crew going through repressed puberty all at once, with no real adult guidance or supervision? 

What could possibly go wrong?|, 8/10 First part of the movie is ""hum this is weird and the people are weird"" the rest of the movie I rarely breathed. Very intense. I liked the cold isolated electronic atmosphere like a LSD trip or something. One of the shots in particular outside the ship was one of the most breathtaking views I have ever seen in film.  The politics are very engaging even though they are almost 100% copy and pasted.|, I saw it yesterday.  The film is interesting in the sense that it questions interstellar travel.  How to reach habitable planets knowing that the distances are long and that therefore the time to reach it is long too.
 In this film, we are shown a spaceship that will reach its goal in 86 years and a generational crew that will reproduce aboard the ship so that their descendants finally reach a new world at the edge of the universe.
  Human nature being what it is, Needless to say, this won't happen without problems."

Love this movie, so well done. The ending makes you wonder what happened next.|, I don’t know why but I keep coming back to this trailer years later it’s so beautiful and an amazing film but this trailer really makes you feel something we all wish we could do|, I find myself coming back to this movie what a underrated masterpiece|, Woah.
Original.
Thoughtful.

Might as well.|, “It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.”


― Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club|, Just watched this film and I must say....it's got to be one of the strangest films I've ever watched but in a good way.  Whilst watching it I was thinking ""so whats the point of it all"" but when he says the words ""I never left my family, I left myself""...it then makes total sense to me that sometimes in our lives, we just wanna run away and not have to be responsible to anyone or anything and just escape the world. Loved the part where he just runs into the house and says ""Tah Dah""....That was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣...interesting film 🤔🤔🤔|, Bellissimo film . Colonna sonora, sublime ❤|, Elegant and thought provoking.

Good comedy,
Good story, good cinematography, and a fucking awesome soundtrack.|, I rewatched this a night ago for the first time in 3 Years and I noticed how much of a masterpiece this movie truly is. It’s like Scarface or Goodfellas, never a dull moment|, Damn...I just watched this movie today and all I can say is wow! This is definitely a standout movie from a year that would be meh if it weren't for a few good movies. It is intense and entertaining, with some good acting and some funny quips here and there, along with some good drama that makes it intense and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Not to mention the soundtrack is awesome! Not that much action as the trailer might lead you to believe, but the drama and acting makes it intense. The tone of the movie is great as well, with some really nice comedy and drama, and not too serious until the final act. However, it still managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. Also, I love good cinematography and this is no exception. Runtime is good too. Really, REALLY impressed on this one. However, I didn't like how the writing sometimes wasn't good but in other places it was strong. That does, however, knock it down some points and it is not perfect so I would give it an 8.5/10. Really good tho|, I DIED EVERYTIME I HEARD JONAH LAUGHING OMG HE NAILED IT|, if jonah hill is in it, ill watch it"

We both were touched and cried like babies (we've been through a lot). This movie is powerful and reminds you that God is in control but you have to let him be in control. I just loved loved this movie!|, I never get tired or bored of watching this movie. The more I watch it, the more I get inspired to pray|, I LOVED this movie. It changed my life and I made my own prayer room. It's kind of crowded in my closet now but it's where I get dressed for my day and dressed for my spiritual battles. My clothes remind me that I need to put on the armor of God. Simply love the message off the movie!.|, This was the most touching movie I've ever seen. I watched with my husband, and we both got choked up. I absolutely love this movie and recommend this to everyone of all ages. It will give you a new perspective on how a Christian is supposed to fight against the enemy.|, I loved this movie. Despite the negative comments from others. I felt it touched my heart and motivated me to seek the Lord in prayer and keep fighting. Yes there are things that could have been done better, {Just like all other movies}  but for those who have the Spirit of the Lord understood the main point message, that is ""Your battles are fought through prayer"" only God can take lead if we let him do the fighting. I have thrown my money to the garbage to movies that do not edify my life, and give me no motivation whatsoever. Not all movies will deliver the same message to everyone. Take the good of everything, after all that is time you will never get back.|, Just watched this film for the first time last week with my friends and I absolutely loved it! Most of the films out these days are pointless and very sinful. We even had a debate at the end discussing the effectiveness of prayer. This film was educative and useful. God bless all those who made this film possible and I hope to see more films like this!|, Saw this movie a while ago at my church... Trust powerful movie brought me to tears.... Prayer is a powerful weapon. God is so good. Amen|, I've been beyond blessed to be able to attend a prescreening of this movie. It is excellent. I'm telling you you will love it. Its hilarious, thought provoking, and hits you right in your heart and spirit. Definitely go see it!!!!|, I'm Muslim, and I LOVED this movie, the message in it was so powerful it touched the deepest part of my heart, god is in control of our lives we must never forget that.|, This movie has truly bless my life in an indescribable way. Since i watch this movie i am not the same. Now i think twice before i speak. I have changed to be a better wife and a better mom. And i must say we all need to have a War Room in your house. This movie was a message from God.  It has open my eyes to see things differently.  Now i see things in the spiritual Realms. Not only did i change, but my husband and my kids have changed. I went to see the movie with my husband only. My kids did not see the movie. Went home made a  War Room and just like in the movies, my kids went and read my prayer list, now you made you own War Room in the Closest. if you have not seen this movie yet, please do. You will never be the same again. Amen."

That's how good it was. I can't wait to see the final installment.|, Just give Andy Serkis an Oscar already!!!|, I really like how this trilogy has not been dragged out longer then it should have and how each movie feels important and can stand on its own without having to watch the other ones.

We Are What We Are,We Are What We Are Official Trailer 1 (2013) - Ambyr Childers Horror Movie HD,kPG9kZmEwcs,1366947,2481,417,"The ending alone is better than most the horror movies out in theaters....great movie,good plot with great acting.|, I really love gore,and horror, and everything that falls in between. If this movie has somewhat gore in it I'll be glad to watch it , if it's horrific in any way I'll be glad to watch it, if it has suspense I'll be glad to watch it and even if it doesn't have any of these I'll still watch it, it doesn't hurt to give something a chance (: |, Awesome movie. It took me months to watch cuz it looked boring. It wasn't. Very original storyline. Crazy ending |, I swear I watch this movie at least once a week. Its the kind of movie that you can watch a billion times, but have a different experience each time.|, Well produced ! I've just seen it and I have to admit that it was not that bad. Simply for the fact that the dirctor did not concentrate on gore scenes which is very good but more on the psychological matter!

Unfortunatelly the end was more than rediculous!|, Doesn't matter how good/bad the movie is, I saw Michael Parks in the trailer and I'll be watching it soon.|, I loved this movie.  I thought the acting was pretty good.  The girl who played the older sister is supposed to be unhappy and unfeeling.  Think about what they do each year.  If she let herself cry and get super upset every time they killed and ate someone, she'd go crazy.  I think she's supposed to be stoic.  The ending was shocking, but I enjoyed it because it's hard for me to be surprised in a movie any more.  Everything that comes out these days is formulaic. |, This film is better than I expected|, i love this movie so much! |, Just watched  ! What amazing movie"
We Are Your Friends,We Are Your Friends - Official Trailer [HD],gZzAeYWXFpk,21221411,114603,5483,"One of my all time favorite movies. Opened my mind up in a lot of ways and wasn’t expecting to feel what I felt in that movie theater at all. Every time I think of this movie now I get nostalgic.|, Aun no lo creo que una pelicula tan buena como esta sea un fracaso de taquilla solo recaudando 1.3 millones de dolares y se invirtienron en ella 6.millones la verdad merece mucho más que esto para mí a sido una de las mejores películas que eh visto me encanto la tematica y su mensaje, es más la motivación que da cuando la terminas de ver  simplemente se merece más|, this movie was actually pretty good. pleasantly surprised. nothing out of this world but takes you to a lot of different places and different than a lot of by the book movies coming out in last years|, This was a very good movie actually, it speaks to anyone who has ever felt lost. It connects like how music connects.|, Honestly? I watched the trailer and thought 'what on earth? this is going to be awful.' but I saw it in the cinema last month, and I gotta tell you this film is actually pretty incredible. I really thought the people behind it did a wonderful, entertaining job.|, One of my all time fave movies. The cinematography and music was amazing and unique with its esoteric aspects which I naturally love and am attracted to, as well as this story being a voice for a lot of young artistic souls looking for a place and way to make it in the world in an unconventional way. Gave a lot of inspiring insight and you can pick up on the spiritual specs in some scenes like in one of the songs he creates “Cole’s Ascend”, saying angel numbers 549 and how synchronicity is electricity repeatedly..didn’t even notice this until I looked back on it after starting my spiritual awakening/journey and I sure did appreciate it in awe haha ❤️⚡️|, I feel like this is such an inspiring trailer. I love the ending. It seems so passionate! Shoot for the stars, chase your dreams! Regardless, I think this movie will be a great movie that lifts you up, and tells you not to give up on your dreams. It's you and me against the world now!|, I hope it doesn't suck. I like the look of it. And the first part of the trailer practically summed up everybody's lives about going to college and then heading out to the real world to do nothing. For me my journey was not EDM music, but film making. |, For me being a aspiring musician I loved this movie read some ""ehhh"" reviews but I was like we're all entitled to our own opinions right?? So I went for it and I couldn't get over how amazing and aspiring this film was and on the plus I love the soundtrack went well with this film. #WELLDONE !!|, Loved this film so much. So quirky and felt so many emotions! Not what I was expecting at all, but in a good way :) WATCH WATCH WATCH!"

Absolutely love it.|, Actually cried tears of laughter with the bloopers when they played theme tune to Friends in the RV. Hilarious.|, Rather funny as a comedic movie, but wayyy more heartwarming than the usual. Switched off my screen feeling a sense of happy warmth. Great watch!|, This was one of the BEST comedy movie ever! I was surfing the internet and i found this a couple months ago and it was AMAZING :)|, Well, I have No Ragrets watching this movie, you know what I'm sayin'?|, they should make a sequel on how they live together in the protection house :D|, I only watched this for the first time tonight and I have to say its one top 5 best comedies of all time. In your into that humor you will absolutely love it. I caught the last 30 mins on tv and then rewatched it straight after. Jennifer and Jason are great. Kathryn Hahn is so under rated she cracks me up just looking at her let alone what comes out of her mouth. She is a comic genius with her satire and toilet humor. 10/10 movie|, I' seen this movie like 3 times it's soo entertaining and i would let my children watch this movie !! It's soo funny |, this is literally the best movie of all fucking time."

""Dear God, if you truly exist please don't give us anything more and don't take anything from us. Let us be like this forever.""|, The most heartwarming line:
""I'd choose you over any blue sky! The weather... CAN STAY CRAZY!!""|, I watched this movie a few weeks ago and let me tell you: just like Your Name, is not the kind of movie you forget about. I started crying 20 minutes into the movie because of how beautiful and artistic everything was and then never stopped. The comedy is on time, the emotions it provides you are so deep that I had a dehydration headache when it was over, and the way Makoto Shinkai uses the surroundings to tell the story is so powerful yet again. If you haven't watched it, do it!|, When he said ""I just want to see her once more."", I actually started to cry.|, The animation is BREATHTAKING.
They really put a lot of time into this. Looks really good.|, I started crying when he held the gun and pointed it at the officer and said ""Why are you holding me"", it felt like he was saying it to the whole world, and when they were falling from the sky and he said ""I want you more than any blue sky"" I just start bawling. This movie was so beautiful and heartwarming 😭😭 No one can do it better than Japan|, Every second of the movie is a wallpaper|, This is a story only she and I know about.

They stood up at the end and laughed at what a terrible movie it was. It made me so angry. I loved this movie so much, something about it resonates with me. People always want a movie that’s “different” and “original” and then you get one and they laugh. I personally loved it and it’s content.|, I have PTSD and i cannot explain how hard i cried when i saw this trailer in theathers. I just want to say thank you to Universal and Steve Carell for making a story about a PTSD victim triumphing. Thank you.|, I watched this movie yesterday, its an amazing movie. Im 13 years old, most of my friends dont like movies like this, so watched it with my grandparents. They had tears in their eyes most of the time! Its my absolute favorite movie, and I liked the special time with my grandparents! Thank you :) Greats from Belguim!|, Just finished watching this movie. Outstanding performance by Steve Carell. Great movie. Very original and heartwarming. Great attention to detail. I don’t really see why people are hating on this movie. A lot of them say it’s an “sjw push”. I don’t really see that and I lean right pretty hard. Being someone with PTSD, I loved the imagery in this movie when dealing with flashbacks and the terror of constantly having suicidal thoughts and blaming yourself.|, Absolutely thrilled for a few reasons
1. Steve deserved a proper dramatic role for so long
2. The story looks deep and original
3. ...Foo Fighters soundtrack!!!|, This was much more of a charming, amazing movie than I thought it would be. Steve carell is expectional. Left me in tears.|, So many good people worked on this film. I am excited to see a classic being born for the very next few decades. Steve Carell is definitely someone I'll stand for in a film!|, This movie has already affected me just by watching the trailer. The first time I watched it I sobbed. I am so excited to be able to watch the whole movie itself 💕|, I've just watched it and it was so good, full of emotions and creativity. Steve was amazing in it. 👏🏻👏🏻❤️|, Am I the only one who loved this movie! I don’t know why everyone hated it"

She’s such an amazing actress who doesn’t get the attention she deserves|, Saw it in the theater yesterday!! Hilarious!! Well done horror that keeps you guessing all the way through!! Milana is so gorgeous and wonderful! The whole cast is excellent!!|, I love movies like this just something to chill through hard times.|, I had no idea this was based on a game. This movie was so fun, I loved the story, characters and the ending was great.|, People need to give it a chance, it's surprisingly good n funny. You gotta love the quirky small town tone and characters. They're not that unique or original but they're memorable and leave an impression. If you ever play a max payne or alan wake game, the characters have those memorable and funny qualities.|, Easily a better horror video game adaptation than the Silent Hill movies.|, I've seen a LOT of scary movie and this is a new favorite. I can't help but wonder how they ran across the song ""I Found Love."" It was on the set list of a Christian rock band I was in from summer of 1969 to the end of 1970. We recorded it on an album here in Nashville but it didn't chart and was never played on the radio. I actually felt an electric shock when that song started. I played lead guitar in that band and hearing it again after all these years took me right back to 1969. Amazing coincidence in my little life.|, Finally、 a werewolf movie that takes the game literally.|, Loved this one and Scare Me. The style reminds me of the ""Supernatural things happening in a small town"" aesthetic that I just love.|, I'm Mexican and I still don't know what a *Mexican Standoff* is? 🇲🇽🤔 I want to see this movie soon! Huge horror and werewolf fan! 🎬🍿😁"
West Side Story,West Side Story – Cast 2021 - America (From &quot;West Side Story&quot;),hoQEddtFN3Q,6587559,78794,3069,"This shows perfectly how Ariana DeBose is a triple threat. She can sing. She can dance. She can act. Ariana was born to play Anita.|, Am I the only one who loves the costume designs in this? The colors are just magnificent in these shots|, And she just won a well deserved Oscar!! Absolutely thrilled for her, she killed it as Anita!|, Ariana was a shining highlight in this remake. She had HUGE shoes to fill, as Rita was ICONIC in this role. She not only filled them, she found a way to make Anita her own instead of trying to just copy, which some might have been tempted to do.

She was utterly brilliant and fully deserved that Oscar.|, Love that exchange of smiles at 1:14 between Anita and her fellow actress.  It’s like they’re breaking character because they know they are about to recreate one of the most iconic scenes in musical history and absolutely kill it!|, Honestly, I found Anita and Bernardo way more interesting than Maria and Tony.|, I love the fact that this version of America took place in different locations where the characters walk around the streets than the original which was just being in a rooftop. As much as I love the original, this version has more energy to it. You can clearly see Spielberg's passion in this musical movie|, And now she is an Academy Awards winner, just like Rita Moreno 60 years prior! 🤩|, I like the palette of colors chosen by Spielberg. It is very different from the original movie, but it helps give the scene its own personality. Both versions complement each other very well.|, Rita Moreno killed it as Anita then Ariana resurrected it and killed it again.  Simply fantastic 💕"

Glad to see her back after all these years.  And this looks cute.  And cool to see that she co-wrote and directed this.|, Ok, I have a big smile on my face after watching this trailer. Why can't there be more movies like this in Hollywood. Just a good story, good acting, and good date movies. :-)|, I feel like great movies are making a comeback. This looks good in a way that most movies haven't in a while.|, This is likely the first movie I will go to the theater to see in over 5 years.  This is the kind of movie that Hollywood had completely forgotten how to make.

And with a budget of only $3 million no less.  Please, we need more movies like this.|, OMG I'm so glad Meg Ryan is back. I missed these type of movies. ❤|, I actually want to see this. I don't say that for many movies. We need Meg Ryan back!|, I think these two are going to be magic! So excited to see a couple of my favorite actors back on the big screen and like somebody else said, I'm glad it's not a bunch of 20 something year olds 😁"
What If,Marvel Studios’ What If…? Season 2 | Official Trailer | Disney+,TiEVqZ2Bc_c,7235004,307958,11140,"This show is theoretically the only marvel show that can run for many seasons. As long as the writers keep coming up with different ideas then we should be in for a treat.|, I love how this trailer gives us just enough to get excited without giving away the whole plot. Well done 😍😍😍|, I am so glad Strange Supreme is coming back. He was definitely the most interesting character on the show quite literally carried his team. I'm glad they're expanding his story|, This is better than all the recent Marvel movies and series combined!!!|, The anthology format of ""What If...?"" is truly brilliant. It allows the show to explore the vast and ever-expanding Marvel multiverse without getting bogged down in the complexities of continuity. Each episode is a self-contained story that can be enjoyed on its own, making it easy to pick up and drop at your leisure. And yet, there's an underlying interconnectedness to the series that keeps you hooked and eager to see what happens next.|, This looks extremely good. It looks like they are doing their own stories as well rather just pulling from the films. The 1602 and 1980s Avengers teams look like they could be the best episodes.|, What if.... Some ideas from this truly amazing series are brought more often to the movies from the MCU? I think it would be a (much needed) contribution.|, This animation is so unique I love it! I wish we had more animated movies that look like that|, That's what Marvel should take advantage of by making standalone multiverse events and go crazy with ideas.|, I really love Strange Supreme's story in What If? I preferred it over Multiverse of Madness, because in MoM Dr. Strange felt more like a supporting character."
What Men Want,What Men Want (2019) - Official Trailer - Paramount Pictures,HeoLiTirRp4,11924335,50874,8992,"The original movie was about a pretty misogynistic man learning the error of his ways after being given the power to read women's minds. It brought up heavy issues (working as a woman in a high stress predominantly male environment, suicide, the trials of women's teenage years) and gave a very positive message about men and women working together rather than butting heads.
Something tells me this 'remake' is going to shit all over those messages.|, I love how they show us the whole movie in just the trailer.|, This movie actually turned out better than I thought. I laughed harder than I had in a while.|, I had a blast watching this movie! Me and friend couldn't stop laughing. Ladies make it a girls night and go have drinks afterwards😂😋🍸🍹|, ever since I saw what women want I have always wanted this movie to come out and now my dreams have come true. I'm definetly seeing this in theaters!!!!|, I'll tell you what men want.  Pretty simple.  A man wants a woman that is going to be loyal.  Loyal means 3 thrings.  Trust, Respect, and Love.  Love isn't the most important, just 1 of the 3.  If you can't provide all 3, you are trash.  Any man that sees you compromise either of those 3, should let you go because you aren't a good woman.  Have a good day.|, In ""What Women Want"" he gains a new respect for women, even the shallow ones, I hope we see similar growth here.|, What men want: a society that actually values them.  To actually get to see their child when full custody is given to the mother.  To have a normal life after serving multiple combat tours.  Just a few of the things men really want.|, This talented woman finally getting her props in Hollywood ! She looks terrific for someone approaching 50.|, I am definitely going to see this. My cousin said it’s like the movie what women want. Which is pretty cool because I felt like we needed to flip the script and look at it in a woman’s point of view. 😂 The funny thing about this is a man directed what women want and a woman directed what men want. Cute"
When Evil Lurks,When Evil Lurks – Official Trailer | HD | IFC Films,YrTnV6gNzno,816922,6697,552,"This is authentic horror. You can't predict what's going to happen next and can't relax for a minute. No silly VFX effects or exaggerated dramatic music. I loved it  👍|, Just watched this last night and the amount of times my mouth opened out of shock was absurd. I felt grossed out and so unsettled the whole time. Definitely one of the best horror flicks I’ve seen in a while.|, Soy argentino y amante del genero del terror desde casi toda mi vida y puedo asegurar que el cine Argentino de terror nunca hizo algo tan impresionante e increíble como este film. Más allá de eso a mi parecer Demian Rugna ha logrado una de las mejores películas de terror de la década. Orgullo total!!!|, watched it last night.. and as an absolute horror fanatic I can confirm that it is amazing.  For me the best Horror film of the year. Feels like you are in a nightmare that just wont end. Absolutely recommend to anyone who loves true horror! None of this shitty American stuff that is recycled over and over. BRAVO DEMIAN! I will be looking forward to your next film.|, la mejor película de terror de los últimos 30 años , junto con la bruja, una película que no necesita de sustos baratos para dar miedo.|, Que orgullo ver a mi profesora de teatro Silvina Sabater en este film|, I just watched this on Shudder, and before I saw this, A24 had this under wraps with ""Talk to Me"". This is such an incredible premise. It was terrifying as fun. A refreshing take on a genre that needed refreshing. It was chilling, thought provoking, and grim. Going to watch it again with my wife and I can't wait to do so. No jump scares, just situational, unraveling, slow horror. Absolutely recommended.|, Saw this movie with some friends recently and it's about as nasty, vicious, and honest a horror movie as I've seen in years. Very good. Don't let the subtitles put you off if you don't speak Spanish. You'll barely even notice them.|, Wow. Horror is by far my favorite genre.  It's all I really watch. I was skeptical of this movie based on the summary I read but gave it a shot because I liked the director and his work with Terrified. Most horror movies aren't very good except ma u be 1 to 3 a year if lucky. This one delivered. One of if not the best of the year for me so far. Acting was amazing and the fact unexpected things happen through whole movie leaves you on edge the whole movie. I've watched 2 movie from this director and both were 10/10. I'll be sure to watch anything he puts out. Hofully Terrified 2 which heard is being made|, Honestly between this and Aterrados this director is becoming the best horror director Latin America has seen ever"

When you see them you'll like them but what touches your feelings the most is after you've finished watching them. They have an ""aftertaste"" that stays in your heart.|, ""Of course I forgive you, I love you"" that's when my heart shattered and I cried even more than what I already was|, You see Studio Ghibli and you know it's gonna be good.|, The part where Marnie was asking for forgiveness, apparently there was a deeper meaning behind it. I saw a comment say that she was not only apologizing for leaving Anna at the silo, but for also leaving her (when Marnie passed away) in the world|, Nobody talks about Anna's eyes, when the film started the first question I asked myself was ""From whom did she get such beautiful blue eyes?"" and I was able to glimpse the connection beyond the storyline and loved the story about two souls connecting through time. Since the ""Grave of the fireflies"" that I had not cry so much with a Studio Ghibli film, I love all of them but I have a special place for ""When Marnie was there"" because it's about those who are gone but who are alive in our hearts and memories.|, this movie is a masterpiece it left me sobbing ive never cried so hard like this its just truly beautiful and too much feels to handle|, Out of all the Studio Ghibli movies I've watched, this made me cry the most. The ending was bittersweet and I love how the MC finally got real happiness by the end. Depression is not an easy topic to discuss, much more PTSD that can lead to forgetting and altering memories in the process of trying to face them all and actually moving forward to become better, to finally free oneself from the sadness one holds in his or her heart. This movie did it in a very beautiful and emotional, but not angsty and irritating way, and may I add, the mystery element is just wonderfully done. The entire time, you'll think of one thing ""Just who is Marnie?"" And the ending will reveal it and I can assure you that it's not your ordinary psychological theme movie. By the end you'll realize that every scene and line, literally everything that happened, makes sense. The plot twist is just sooo great. This movie is a masterpiece.|, When Anna told Marnie “I called for you, and in my heart I shouted,” I fell in love with this movie. That’s just pure poetry|, *when marnie waved at the end* emotionally ruined forever|, As a grandma’s girl, this had me bawling like a baby. I’m years late but OH MY STUDIO GHIBLI🥺😭"

They didn't lose a game until the year after he graduated. He was the sports editor, then the editor of the newspaper. It was a time of great pride and accomplishment. I can't wait to see this movie!|, Just finished watching WHEN THE GAME STANDS TALL. And finally understood the commitment, the passion, the  strength that goes in to football. A team it's like the family a lot of us wish we had....   |, this movie is not only inspiring but has many profound moments. a lesson my parents taught me and grandparents. Quitting is not an option , you never alone, and it's in those atrocious moments that being humble and picking yourself back up and keep going will turn an atrocious moment into building character and self esteem. I hope any watch this and see we all have our moments life at times is difficult and by all means love one another. saving them and yourself .|, I know this came out years ago and maybe no one cares now, however I loved this movie. I cried 5 times within the first hour. So many people can truly relate to this, fabulous job.|, I saw the premier of this last night and having seen quite a few football movies, I would rate this one right at the top! It had me laughing, cheering, and choking up at times. I thought I knew what was going to happen time after time, and was wrong each time! This movie is packed with plenty of really useful life lessons. Can't wait to go see it again!|, Awesome movie,you can't play a team sport if you don't realise it's about the unit,the family,the brotherhood.|, Saw this movie today with my entire football team. Was actually a really good movie and shows that teamwork is key to success, and no matter win or loose it's all about getting out there and just giving it your best shot. Because when you're out there...you're not a team...you're a FAMILY and those people you call ""teammates"" are your brothers |, This is so cool...every other school in the league was competing for second, because we always knew that De La Salle would win it all. Awesome to see that their hard work is being recognized in a movie. "

Brilliant movie albeit sad but that is to be expected from a war movie :-)  Different perspective too with the biracial aspect, instead of her being Jewish.  Loved it and nice to see an Aussie actress playing her mum|, all the people hating on this movie are the tunnel visioned assholes who fail to have any regard for people, on another note, this movie will for sure make you bawl your eyes out, and it follows a love story that approaches many difficulties. 10/10 recommended!!|, This is why I keep my Netflix account.  To see hidden gems like this, I would have never seen.|, Her mom was right about everything!! The whole time😫😩|, I personally think that this movie is the best war movie I have ever seen....I'm not exaggerating..... I think it is better than 1917 and Fury that was the best for me..... It is worth seeing it not only for the love story but for the passing messages😊😊❤️

P. S. I have already seen this movie before I watched trailer❤️❤️❤️|, Acabo de ver. DURO, TRISTE, REAL. Ser negro e alemão durante a Segunda Guerra ainda ecoa de muitas formas quando se é negro e se vive em certos lugares, se transita em certos meios e grupos por todo o mundo. Qualquer tipo de discriminação é abominável, mas talvez o racismo seja umas das mais cruéis, pois não há como enganá-lo, não há como esconder-se dele. E se vive to-dos-os-di-as...

This is how you make a good film trailer. It doesn’t show too much time. Daisy Edgar-Jones is one hell of an actress. Taylor’s vocals in this are just absolutely stunning. It definitely matched the whole vibe.|, I'm a 38 year old Man's Man (Guns, Muscle Cars, Harleys, Wood Worker, and a Machinist) and this movie struck every chord with me. I live on a swamp in Florida and grew up in a abusive household myself. This was beautifully done. But it will get your emotions going if you've experienced what has happened in this movie. ""And that's all I can say about that..""|, I love this movie. I cried through several scenes. I haven’t seen a heart felt film in a while. Amazing, everything! Very well thought out, I do agree the main character could have looked more messier considering she lived in a shack near a swamp. But the storyline is 10/10.|, I just finished watching this, can't believe how good it was.  cried like a baby.  great movie.|, I was raised in the street and I had to do anything to survive  watching this movie made me feel how special I was|, Absolutely loved this movie, the ending had me sobbing.|, One of the most beautifully written novels I’ve ever read. When Daisy was cast as Kya I knew they understood what they were doing. I’m so excited to see this fantastic book come to life. First movie that will get me to go to the movie theaters in a long time.|, I just came back to the trailer to say this was the best 10/10 movie of all time ive watched, cried like a baby. Everything in this was just beautiful and heartwarming the story and definitely the ending.😢😭❤|, I have read the book twice and listened to it on audio several times. This was one of the most captivating stories I have ever read. Drama, suspense, love lost and regained, mysterious. Not to mention, the story is so believable for the time and place it was supposed to have occurred. Delia Owens may join elite company with this masterpiece. I think that the movie version of any great
story falls short when it is condensed into what people expect to sit through. Saying that, I wont miss it. If you've never read the book, you're missing one of the best in a while.|, Saw this last night. The book is my favourite, Ive read it 3 times. I resonate a lot with Kya, it was super emotional for me to see the Movie, I was crying in the theatre after everyone was gone. A movie is never exactly like the book but this was just as good as I could have imagined it would be! Thank you Delia Owens for such a beautiful tale of hope and resilience!"

Putting Holywood movie romancing aside, I'd say it's so far the best film that captures what a westerner/european civilian might feel like living in such a place.|, ""That sucks.  That sucks for women.""

LOL!!  I almost bust a gut on that one!|, This will be the funniest movie of 2016. And I just love Tina Fey.|, Just watched this movie I loved it because it's different it's almost nowadays you know exactly how the movie is going to end before it even begins and this one was awesome unpredictable funny and she was awesome in it|, This looks like a decent comedy.

I saw this trailer on a commercial for the first time a week ago, and as soon as I saw the kid I knew exactly what this was. I hadn't known they were making a film about the story. Hopefully one day we'll get a movie based in Detroit not about drugs or murder.|, 1:42-2:02 Those lines are just to real. A son trying to help his father. Favorite part of this magnificent trailer|, Two things got me hyped for this movie. 

1. ""Based on a true story""

2. Badass Matthew Mcconoughey|, You know what’s funny about this movie? They didn’t need to build a set of Detroit. They could film real life Detroit and it looks the same!|, I can't stop watching this trailer. Amazing. It gives me chills, makes me wish I was alive in the eighties so I could be nostalgic. Looking forward to this movie, hope it lives up to this trailer!|, oh shit, I remember being very excited to see this film. And now it's two years later and I still haven't watched it.... God time flies|, This movie bought tears to my eyes😭😢😢he didn't had to go through all that. Oh no my boy ricky😭😢😢😭|, Just saw this movie today and it was so good. I went in wearing a full face of makeup and by the end, i had cried it all off.

This trailer is also a banger, can't lose with White God.|, The movie is very dark and heart breaking. It's disgusting to know what some people do to animals in a daily basics. Very eye opening, touching and deep movie. The dogs who play as ""Hagen"" did a fenomenal job.|, one of the most heartbreaking stories i've ever seen. the whole movie is truly masterpiece|, Saw this movie when it came out. I used to go to the movies 2 or 3 times a week. Seeing dozens of movies one after the other.
This is one of the few that stands out.
That scene of the dog running on the highway. Lets just say in the context of the movie it hits like a ton of bricks. 
I literally wanted to stand up and shout.|, Just watched this movie last night.  Honestly, it's one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years.  Fucking genius.|, This is a wonderful movie and the amount of work the dog trainers put into it is astounding !!!|, The last scene with the dog and the girl simply amazing|, Awesome movie, just what I like. A ridiculous premise taking to the extreme, but it turned out to be more than that, not ridiculous at all. One of my favorites already.|, I'M CRYING SO HARD I LOVE MY DOG SO MUCH."
White House Down,White House Down (2013) - Air Force One Destroyed Scene (8/10) | Movieclips,c4ibjfBu1IY,9231575,71840,4382,"On the one hand, I love this scene because it’s insane as heck. But at the same time knowing full well that Airforce one was one of the most sophisticated 747’s ever built, I don’t think it would have been THAT easy to destroy with one missile.|, this is the type of movie that makes you have a seizure from unrealism|, I love the idea that when you ""ACCESS NORAD"" it's just four buttons.
Almost expected Clippy to say ""It looks like you're trying to launch a missile at Air Force One, would you like some help with that?""|, the thing i love the most about this scene is: that farmer looking like he doesn't care|, The real Air Force One has complete defense systems against any missile|, Air Force one: We are under attack 

Fighter jet: No, no, no......you are under attack.|, 1:14 Air Force One: *this is an emergency I repeat this is an emergency*

Also Air Force One: Doesn’t want to deploy countermeasures|, I like how the escort fighter just pops flares and acknowledges that they all dead, instead of following the plane at a close distance|, That's a huge missile, probably some kind of intercontinental ballistic missile, still it doesn't completely obliterates the Air Force One|, They shot down the plane killing a whole bunch of people but especially Jenna, the attractive, quirky lady who was the VP's assistant but had a couple of nice moments in the movie - including a nice bit of comic relief - and was obviously keen on Cale. In movies like this you don't kill off characters like that - and in such a casual way too. Left a bad taste."

I love 70s and 80s rock|, I am 76 yrs old and whenever times get tough I listen to ""my"" music and it does sooth the soul!|, Whitesnake was so much more than a one-hit-wonder glam rock band. They have lots of unbelievable, purebred rock classics, excellent guitar playing and vocals.|, Rest in peace Bernie. Thanks for all the memories you gave us all. You were one helluva guitarist and will be missed.|, In the 70s, 80s, and 90s, we had no idea how good we had it. The movies, the TV shows, and especially the music was so special, and remains so to this day. R.I.P. Tawny Kitaen.|, I was unemployed for 6 whole years because hard narcotics took over my life and turned me into a bum. Clean now and working 60hours a week. This song came on the other day while driving the duty van and HOLY SMOKES it gave me the chills. Seems to apply perfectly. Much Love to anyone stuck in life.|, Omg.

Everything looks so stunning.|, I don’t know why this movie has low ratings. I watched it in the theaters last night and I absolutely loved it!|, Amazing performances by the cast, it has its few scary well placed moments in between a psychological horror story. That kid, damn his possession was the scariest part of the story. Well done atmospheric setting for the story, it reminded me of the Lady In Black as well.|, As someone who grew up in San Jose, I am hella stoked to see this!  I know it is very, very, distantly based on true events, but I'm looking forward to the cinematic exploration of Llanda Villa.|, (FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW THIS LEGEND OR KEEP SAYING SAM&DEAN WINCHESTER JOKES) Sarah Winchester is part of the family that built and designed the Winchester rifle. This gun became a famous gun in the 1800s-1900s and took many lives with it. Those who have died from the Winchester rifle came to haunt Sarah for making the rifle that took their lives. In order to rid of the spirits, she ordered for the mansion to have infinite doorways and stairs leading to  nowhere, trapping the spirits in a maze like structure.|, Remember everyone, it's not a 'creepy' Hollywood horror movie trailer unless there's a little kid singing nursery rhymes|, I absolutely loved this movie!

Wind River,WIND RIVER Trailer (2017),s7WuKdVhrmA,3248657,14479,1070,"It’s one of those films where you sit still for another 10 minutes post credits in deep thought and awe. Amazing film 10/10.|, I have no words. I just watched this tonight...and as someone who appreciates the inspiration and imagination that goes into creating a mindblowing and powerful masterpiece like this I can only salute the director and screenwriters...as a writer, I saw the raw beauty of the theme and moral that plays trough out this film ....this story brought me to tears...the pain of the parents..the innocence of Natalie, Matt and Emily...and the evil out there ....the reality of these stories hit to close to my heart tonight and the reality of the challenges Indigenous communities had been facing for so long..so many voices not being heard or understood ...as a writer my mind has already tried to imagine a story that can captivate people as this story has captivated me. my heart breaks for the indigenous woman and families that have been victims of such pain ..such evil and such undermining.|, If you had 10 friends and asked each of them who watched this movie, none of them would have said yes. One of those fly-by gems. If you get a chance, watch it. The tension created throughout the movie is excellent. Olsen and Renner were great together.|, This is not an action film, but the trailer has to edit it this way to attract attention. This is an amazing slow-burn modern western thriller/mystery with so much emotion, tension, heart and atmosphere, and honestly phenomenal performances by just about everyone in the cast. I think this might just be one of my favorite films of the last decade. This film actually reminds me a lot of Sicario in terms of pacing and tension, which is in itself a compliment.|, This is one of those quiet gems you sometimes find in your travels and marvel at the creativity, the story telling, the suspense, and the closure. One of the most memorable, in my living memory at least, films I've been privileged to watch. And the actors make it so too.|, Elizabeth Olsen is such a great actress. I love the cinematic winter feel. The Western/ American Indian setting is so cool. Looks like a slow burn psychological thriller. Perfect!|, I remember watching this trailer and thinking this looks terrible and then I saw the movie and was blown away with how good it was|, I'm glad Jeremy Renner's on on a streak of great movies. The Hurt Locker, The Town, Assassination of Jesse James, Arrival and now this. He needs more recognition outside of his blockbuster roles.|, Just watched it not knowing anything about it, had never heard of the movie either. Why didn't the movie win more awards or was more publicized? It carries such an important message, one that definitely needs to be known to more people and make them aware of the sickening and frustrating reality that exists for a lot of Native Americans! 
The movie was beautifully shot, it captured the eerie isolation of the reservation, the icy cold, the rough life and the beauty of the vast mountain nature perfectly. The writing was amazing as well, the actors did a great job and I'm glad J.Renner and E.Olsen are taking these smaller indie movie roles and not just rely on the huge franchise movies, so they can highlight and show their full potential as actors ! The story had me clued to the TV from the get go and it got more and more suspenseful, incredibly sad and brutal, some scenes were difficult to watch. It also made me very upset and frustrated when I realized that this is indeed not far from reality (it probably even has a way ""happier"" ending than real life, which makes it even more infuriating) and it's an issue that needs more attention. The enormous injustice and lack of equal laws, when it comes to persecuting crimes against Native Americans, committed on their land, is something that desperately needs to be changed. I can't believe this is still a reality for Native Americans! As a European, I didn't know about it, except for the many horrible countless unsolved murders on the ""Highway of Tears"" in Canada which tells me that not enough has been done there, as well. Underrated and probably overlooked movie, I'm so glad I stumbled across it and I'm sure most people who consider to watch it won't be disappointed!|, Something about movies that dare to be this bleak have always called to me and moved me. Even the ending. No one is a winner. This is life sometimes and this movie is not afraid to make you sit with that. Just phenomenal."

It was definitely one of the cinematic moments in film history.|, The part where Pooh told Piglet. ""No I am your father!"" sent chills down my spine and the lightsaber battles are looking quite epic.|, I especially like the part when the Pooh turned back and said ''It's over Piglet, I have the highground.'' such a emotional and dark scene|, 10 years later and it still gives me chills|, I love the part when Pooh said ""he had to take a pooh.""|, The scene where pooh said ""i am pooh"" then snapped his fingers with the infinity gauntlet was truly one of the scenes of all time|, I have a feeling I'm going to laugh the whole entire movie 😂|, As someone who grew up watching Winnie The Pooh, this is beyond nightmarish. Pooh was all about honey and nothing else. Piglet and Tigger were the sidekicks and the rest of the characters (Rabbit, Eeyore, etc.) basically follow them through with their adventures. This is definitely brutal. Despite it being just an indie film, it certainly captures the essence of another blockbuster slasher in the making.|, I love the part in the movie where pooh is on the floor and everyone tries to avoid stepping in it."

 peter lake and beverly white will always cherish your kind of love..❤|, I was concerned how they would translate this wonderful book into a movie. but from watching this trailer I think I might be pleasantly surprised!|, i loved it..i cried and cried and cried. it's a beautiful story. and for all of you complaining about the flying horses and what not ITS A FANTASY MOVIE what did you expect. |, I'm a little surprised that some many people didn't like this movie. I'll agree there were some minor problems that I didn't like and the plot was a little weird, but I liked it a lot. Colin Ferrell did a great job in my opinion and I really liked Russell Crowe did a great job too. Not sure why Will Smith needed to be in this movie. Could've done without him. |, Fantastic movie! Many people wanna bash it and disect it and can't accept it for what it is......a ROMANTIC FANTASY.|, The book is simply amazing, after reading it however I realized that the plot line was much too complex to make a movie without leaving out many key parts and characters. Peter Lake and Beverly are just two of the many many important characters in that novel. If you saw the movie and hated it, I suggest you read the book for a pleasant surprise. :)|, The book is astonishingly good.  There's no way a film could even begin to tell the story, not without spending a Lord of the Rings budget and splitting it into 3 or 4 parts which they clearly didn't do and it shows.  Please, please read the book - it might just be the finest book you ever read.|, There was a period in my life where I would come across my paperback copy of this book and reread it. It's been a while since the last time, but I still remember loving the tale. I'll have to see if the telling is as good as the book. Definitely time to download and read Mark Helprin's novel again.|, The only love movie that makes me cry from beauty and sadness. It's truly a master piece of it's own"
Wish,Wish | Official Trailer,oyRxxpD3yNw,10000473,68109,14029,"I actually don’t think the king is wrong in not granting every wish… curious to see where Disney takes this.|, Giving the villain a crazy look every now and then won't make people hate him. Dude literally has a point.|, The King is the real hero of this story. Not everybody should get what they want. If that happened then the world would be over. Whats best for the people is best for the kingdom, and sometimes people don't want whats best for them.|, I’m actually rooting for the antagonist this time|, The King doesn't just have a point, he should be the real hero. If everyone deserved to be granted everything their hearts desired, then that would mean that you'd have to grant such wishes as a genocidal maniac wanting to destroy entire peoples, or evil advisors wanting to usurp the throne and become the most powerful sorcerer in the universe.|, Man I love girl protagonist, she sure is completely new, and not an overused character archetype Disney has been recycling for decades.|, her personality down to the way she speaks and her expressions are identical to like every disney protagonist we’ve had since tangled. is this not exhausting to anyone?|, A lot animators verified to have worked on this movie while keeping their anonymity have said working on this film was horrible and depressing. It started off a totally different film, and people from corporate kept making them change things until it was dull and lifeless. Disney is OVER. They've completely lost the magic they once had.|, arts beautiful in this movie 100% but  the message that everyone is entitled to everything they want without even questioning the consequences is crazy to me.  Very on brand for you Disney slip those little msgs in your movies ;)|, 2:22 best part of the trailer!"
Wish I Was Here,WISH I WAS HERE - Official Trailer - In Theaters July 18th,aCponfeWNOI,3681621,0,495,"This movie is SO underrated and deserved a lot higher on Rotten Tomatoes. The thing with indie films is people never like them because they are a bit slower, but its like that because it's realistic. In life there isn't always a climax, it just happens and so much goes into those small moments! This film was incredibly powerful and I highly recommend.|, This movie is amazing, honestly. Zach Braff is a very dividing director, but I love the way he uses soundtracks to add emotional impact and also that he uses characters that aren't quite emotionally matured or prepared for what they go through in the movie. It's a coming of age movie about an adult. Critics didn't like that, but who's to say that every adult has to know what they're doing straight away?|, This was a sweet, heart warming movie.  I don't know why some people hate on it so much.  But who cares, it's a great movie for me.|, This is such a brilliant movie, that more people need to watch. Zach Braff wrote an amazing story, and the cast was phenomenal.|, Even if you don’t get the plot from the trailer this is honestly a beautiful movie and the soundtrack they used is amazing|, This trailer itself is a piece of art Life-like I come back to it regularly ❤|, This was an amazing movie! it was just sooo sweet, and heartwarming and emotional. I mean, i laughed, i cried and it was so full of all kind of emotions. I am a huge fan of Jim Parsons, and not just because of him playing Sheldon, but it's just that he actually is a great human being AND a fabolous actor. I understand that he has been co-writing this movie, and it just made me feel so happy because of alle the good emotions i felt when i was done watching the movie. I really think that it just tells us so much about his real life character, all the good feelings this movie awakens. It is after all 2015, and i can say this with all honesty; i've really missed a movie like this for a long time now. AAND great acting and perfect chose of the actors! i really recommend it :))|, Love this movie so much, it gives me so many smiles and some tears too|, I just saw this film last night. I know it got bad reviews but it was actually very good. Filled with emotion and lots of laughs. It's not the best film you'll see, but I think critics were a little harsh on ratings. I recommend it. |, Just watched the movie and all I can say is wonderfull work...zach braff did exactly what he promised to do...i think this will be one of those movies that i watch year after year...great work"
Wish Upon,Best of the Worst Spotlight: Wish Upon,7TVUTgoG1yI,280196,15933,1496,"Watching an elder die in a bathtub, Mike Stoklasa is not amused. He is ecstatic. He writhes his clothes in a sickening delight.|, I'm horribly disappointed that you guys didn't talk about how after Joey King calls the mean girl ""ultimate smegma,"" she then proceeds to hold up a phone so she can *read the dictionary definition of smegma out loud to everyone*, and then when they start fighting, her friend goes ""Kick her ass, Clare! Drop her like a red-headed baby straight out the VAGINA!""|, Mike and Jay: ""It's so awkward to hear these old writers try to appeal to young people with dated slang.""
Rich: ""Aw, snap.""|, I love how Mike tried to correct Rich regarding the Monkey's Paw but was completely incorrect. Rich literally referenced the movie and explained the concept correctly. The reason the guy got the money in the original story was because his son died, and the money was the life insurance payout. So yes, the wish is connected to the bad thing, just like with genies.|, Mike laughing at the elderly is like the dinosaur laughing at the asteroid.|, Mike during the FNAF segment of their catch up video sounded like he had never touched a video game in his life, yet said the phrase ""gacha game"" with full confidence and knowledge of what the term means.|, Whoever got away with selling those cpr babies is a genius. They’re still used and about as effective a teaching tool as they look lol|, Mike is openly laughing at more and more things lately... it brings me happiness.|, Roger Ebert was such a legend, that he reviewed this from beyond the grave|, The funny thing about Mike's little spiel about the difference between a genie wish and a monkey paw wish is that he got the plot of the original story completely backwards. The reason he got the money was because of his son's death. His son was killed in a factory accident and the father received the life insurance money. Which falls much closer to how Mike describes a genie type wish. I demand a Tums Festival level apology video within the week."

Wolf Warrior 2,WOLF WARRIOR 2 Trailer (2017) Action Movie,fkqGiPB2D8M,3666956,9438,1584,"Apparently Wolf Warrior 2 was a massive commercial success and has become the highest-grossing Chinese film ever released.

Woman in Gold,"Woman in Gold TRAILER 1 (2015) - Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes Movie HD",ZqC28wtsaig,307996,1958,76,"Love this movie. Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds did an awesome job of portraying Maria Altman and Randol Schonberg . So happy for Maria, that she got justice and her paintings back .|, Just wonderful! Only the one that has visited Vienna and the museum where there are all the arts and portraits will understand more the feeling of Maria! I cried for the injustices that was made to people, living their family finding peace else where. There are places that connect us with our beloved, but there are objects that will remind us the joy and fully happiness of the moment. 
Great movie, great in everything! You will cry a lot!|, A great story, relentless pursuit of justice. In a world full of injustice. Loved this movie. The Klimt painting if her Aunt is gorgeous.|, A wonderful movie based on a true story. This movie does not only portray the legal matters but also the emotion and memories of your loved ones, how objects remind you of the happiness felt or the fear, the pain you lived through trying to bury those feelings to move on. And most important that the law, using the law should be a way to archive truth and justice and not to protect your main income (in this case the painting itself for the museum). This is a movie worth to be watch at least once in every ones lifetime.|, This is an heart wrenching movie. Just one story amongst hundreds of thousands.  The main abroad m actors did the real life people, proud.|, I loved this movie (Yes I love Ryan Reynolds) and Helen was wonderful. It’s a shame that not to many people commented on such an outstanding movie.|, I teared up when Randy was crying in the washroom scene. Although he did not witness it first hand I am sure he can so painfully imagine all the injustices and cruelty his grandparents has gone through. The reason I teared up, to be very honest, is because it reminded me how I feel about my Palestianian grandparents now finding a home in Canada, who always told us how beautiful they're home and life was in Safad, Palestine. My four grandparents (from my mom and dad side) are all from Safad. As my grandpa developed Alzheimers disease,  one of the things he would still fondly remember and talk about is his parent's olive trees in Safad, how many they had and how they made olive oil. 

I am very suprised by the Israeli people knowing the injustice and cruelty they have gone through, how can they inflict the same injustice and cruetly on Palestinians... I shed tears at Palestine's history leading my grandparents leaving in 1948 and she tears until now as Israel continues to displace more of my people.|, Such a wonderful story! Loved it❤|, This movie was honestly just awesome can't love it enough!|, Loved it! It even made me cry!"
Women Talking,WOMEN TALKING | Official Trailer,pD0mFhMqDCE,10009233,6663,1149,"This movie was beyond excellent. The moment that they talked about how there is no bad forgiveness but that sometimes forgiveness and permission can be confused was phenomenal. I really enjoyed this!|, This movie was profound and incredibly well done. I want to see it again it was phenomenal. I hope that people will remember the true story of what has happened and is still happening to the women in Bolivia|, Such a beautiful movie. Why is it that as a woman who is incredibly privileged and protected, I can still relate to these characters and understand their struggles? I just felt so close to them, like I was there 😔|, Saw this at a film festival last weekend and I can't stop thinking about it.  Very moving with exceptional performances and musical score.  I can't wait for the official release so I can see it again!|, Sarah Polley is simply brilliant at anything she does.  I recommend anyone who liked this film view Stories We Tell.  Her documentary about her life.  It's absolutely one of the best films ever made.|, i didn't expect ben whishaw to make me cry. i've known him as Q for a long time and seeing him nail a more emotionally challenging role is amazing|, Love the score so far, hopefully Hildur wins her second Oscar for it 🙏|, I highly recommend watching this movie.

Sometimes that is so lacking in our world.|, Fred Rogers was an ordained Christian minister who rarely (if ever) talked about God or scripture. Instead he exemplified it, not just through works but also through demonstrating love, kindness,  acceptance, and justice.|, When he fed his fish, Mister Rogers made a point to say out loud that he was feeding the fish.

Why?

Because he learned that a blind girl always listened to the show and when he did not say - out loud - that he was feeding the fish, the blind girl got concerned that he was not feeding the fish. 
So he made certain he said - out loud - that he was feeding the fish for the blind girls benefit.

He had such an understanding of a child's mindset and their worries.|, It's a crime this movie wasn't even nominated for the Best Documentary Academy Award, they should be ashamed|, We can't wait to see this! What an inspiration. <3|, i just watched this and cried the whole time. the respect he held for children and the respect for the amount of intelligence they have was so beautiful and important. we need a show like this today.|, When he says “love or the lack of it” that darkness just under the surface gives me chills.

She is literally so empathetic. The entire scene is just BEAUTY.|, I love how she doesn’t kill if she doesn’t have to.
That's Diana’s compassion, many of those men just want the war to end so they can go home.|, This part was definitely epic. ""It's what I'm going to do."" That line got me. The music and her slow walk at the beginning oh my God. When they jumped in to help her risking their mortal lives always makes me cry. She had true friends backing her up the whole movie. Incredible scene and great movie.|, What I love about this movie is that it clearly shows that WW is total badass and that she always do what she believes is right. But also the military men aren't just standing around being completely useless. From beginning to end, it shows everyone doing the best they can in whatever capacity they can|, I love how as a superhero her femininity, emotions and compassion make her stronger and she embraces that instead of taking on a more “masculine” persona|, This scene will always be one of the most powerful scenes in a DC movie. It was in this scene that you can truly see how heroic she is-she didn't care how dangerous it was to cross No Man's Land as long as she could help those around her. That is what truly makes someone a hero: risking it all to save people.|, I loved how, even though it would've been so easy to put in a ""But I am no man"" line in this scene, they chose not to. ""It's what I'm going to do"". Her climbing up to cross No Man's Land is not about her being a woman or doing something no one else could do, it's about her choosing to be a hero, to stick to her morals and do what she thinks is right.|, THIS IS A TRUE FEMALE PROTAGONIST!

Well acted the three kids do a great job. The historical detail is good too, the last part of the film led to Onion Ninja Attacks a bit  but it was worth it.

There were a few parts where I thought the movie would disintegrate, but as a whole, I liked it.|, It's 2019 and yet not a single decent Zombie movie can top World War Z. Thank you to everyone who committed their time into this movie back then. Cheers! :D|, Now these, these are proper zombies, these zombies have determination."
Wrath of Man,WRATH OF MAN | Official Trailer | MGM Studios,EFYEni2gsK0,36193409,153411,5085,"This man can literally act in any action movie and it automatically makes me want to watch it.|, You know it's that good when you come back to watch the trailer|, Just watched the movie. It is simply great. An action movie done right. From start to finish (also thanks to the intense music) it gets more and more intense. I expected a regular Jason Statham movie with a simple plot but I forgot it was a Guy Richie movie, so he turned a simple action movie into a freaking great brutal action/thriller movie that has you glued to the screen from start to finish.|, Just came here to confirm this movie is a masterpiece.... Its been such a long time since I've watched such a good quality movie, congratulations to every person who participated... Its pretty rare to find a good movie these days.|, It's amazing how Jason Stratham brings so much intelligence, coolness, bravado, and perfect vengeance in action movies.  He truly is an actor whom I would make it a point to watch in any action film that he stars in.  I was excited from the title alone to watch this one!  It was absolutely amazing to watch.|, This is one of the best bullet/action movies I've ever seen!
 I mean....I just cannot use words to express myself right now! 
Perfect quantity and balance between plot and actual gunfights, amazing performance, not only from Jason Statham, but from everybody.
 Such a fitting soundtrack for this movie and the ending was as it should be, not like some great movies with tedious endings.|, Whoever was in charge of the trailer deserves a raise. Those gunshots with the music were amazing.|, My lungs, liver, spleen and heart are amazed after watching this master piece..|, Absolutely incredible. Guy Ritchie made a masterpiece for this one. The music, story, acting, plot, cinematography all worked well in this one. So good i want to watched again with my friends and family.|, This movie is not your regular movie.  Every scene is just beauty . Tense , adrenaline rush, emotions , action . Just watched a masterpiece in disguise of a regular action movie"

You'll still feel in this heart and can straight up vibe to it.|, This song brings me my youth back!

X-Men: Apocalypse,X-Men: Apocalypse | Teaser Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,COvnHv42T-A,56723612,303838,37499,"I’ve seen the movie so many times but this trailer still gets me pumped, love the xmen|, 5 years later and I still love this trailer more than most any Marvel trailer out there. Specifically the music to this and every other trailer for this.|, When Xavier's eyes went completely black still gives me chills years later, THAT was the best part of the trailer|, “Or the Bible got it from him”
Still gives me chills. This man was so powerful, numerous civilizations interpreted him as God|, This was one of their absolute best movies. I would give it 4 1/2 stars at least. I was surprised at how well done it was and have lost even more faith in the so called critics who say it was bad. This was a very good movie.|, Some people hated this film but I do really really love this! Why?? They showed here how each x-men members do their powers and how powerful they are on it's own (and the fact that kurt and Peter is new but still got a lot of exposure). Plus, the cameo of Wolverine!  I also like Charles emotions towards them and to other students, ready to sacrifice himself. Overall I LOVE IT!!! 

This is my fave x-men films along with Day of Future Past,First Class, and Logan.|, SPOILER: everyone becomes bald at the end of the movie.|, ""Everything the old X-men franchises has built, Will fall! And from the ashes of their world! We'll build a better timeline!""|, this movie is awesome. I'm glad to see that they finally put Apocalypse in the x-men movies. I love this movie. the acting is good, the special effects are good, the story is good and the guy who played Apocalypse was awesome. and it was awesome to see Wolverine in the movie even though he originally was not supposed to be in it. but you can not have an x-men movie without Wolverine. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do|, The fact that the most replayed snippet in this trailer is quicksilver's iconic scene proves that marvel needs to take notes on this underrated character, literally deserved more recognition."
X-Men: Days of Future Past,X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST - Official Trailer (2014),pK2zYHWDZKo,37651153,153874,27146,"The greatest. This is the trailer that made me want to make trailers.|, ""Please... We need you to hope again.""

Such a powerful line! 😭😭😭|, I don’t think any future MCU movie about the X-Men will be as good as this one, this is a masterpiece|, When the Trailer MATCHES the movie in overall quality.|, One of the best trailers ever made. The dialogue the emotions, still gives me shivers. _""Lead me. GUIDE me. Be patient with me. It's going to take the two of us. Side by side to end this war, before it ever begins.""_ _""I don't want your suffering, I don't WANT YOUR FUTURE!""_ James McAvoy was great as young Charles|, This movie doesnt get enough credit and is so underrated in the marvel universe. Its in my top 3 Marvel movies. Just epic.|, Probably the best movie trailer Ive ever seen, cant wait for this movie|, This movie was more than a superhero movie, it was a masterpiece|, I don't have enough words to express how well thought and well made this movie is.  It's just a masterpiece.|, When this trailer dropped the amount of hype in me was on another level. Then I went in saw it in theaters. Walking out after it ended and realizing that it lived up to the hype made me so happy.

The post credit scene made me even more hyped for apocalypse, and that DID NOT live up to the hype..."

You Hurt My Feelings,You Hurt My Feelings | Official Trailer HD | A24,20GWk5cWPBs,4739398,15433,694,"This is honestly so true to life. It’s just so refreshing to see a movie without an overdramatized or cliche plot. Just a couple having the boring day to day issues, but showing the realistic love that keeps them together|, I can't get enough of A24 films, They perfectly capture the human element in just the most raw form. It's Beautiful|, This seems refreshing. We appreciate the fact that A24 has gone through such lengths to produce quality films over time.|, I love Nicole Holofcener movies. She depicts those little slices of life so accurately without being melodramatic and cringe. Walking and Talking will always be my favorite of hers.|, I'm glad A24 is making more films like this, I love their horror and experimental films but this kind is missing from cinema a little.|, Just saw this and loved it!. The writing and direction is great and the cast is excellent. Was great to be in a cinema hearing an audience of adults laughing at witty dialogue, at a time when it seems hard to find something that isn't a Marvel movie.  And as much as l love comedy, I don't often actually laugh out loud at something, but the surprising dialogue and line deliveries throughout the movie kept catching me off guard and making me burst out laughing. Julia Louis-Dreyfus shows a deeper side of her talent here, going beyond her comedy skills and really bringing her character to life. British actor Tobias Menzies, who played Prince Philip in The Crown, is excellent as the husband. How are Brit actors so good at doing American accents that it never occurs to you they are British?  And loved Jeannie Berlin as the annoying mother. Berlin makes the character real rather than just a sit-com type and her line deliveries are understated and hilarious. I know so many women like her. The audience applauded at the end, something that does not happen often in cinema screenings. Brava, Nicole Holofcener!|, I became a huge fan of Holofcener after Walking and Talking. Every film is fresh, funny, clever and surprisingly emotional. I also love her economy with story; she can get it done beautifully in 90 minutes or so, which is just how long most movies should be. I can't wait to see this 14 or 15 times.|, This has to be one of the most relatable films.|, People who can relate to: *""Can you shut up and keep talking?!""* and take that as a cue, to state their 'feelings' will appreciate this story!😊Best part is every character here seem amiable already!|, Excited to see Tobias Menzies in this! The most underrated actor in this trailer that no one seems to be mentioning.. hoping this role gets him bigger parts in his next project"
You Were Never Really Here,You Were Never Really Here – Official Trailer | Amazon Studios,R8oYYg75Qvg,3970772,12724,854,"I'm not saying this for attention or anything of that sort I usually hide my military service and don't talk of it but I gotta say being former military with PTSD , his acting of cold, disconnection, overwhelming anxiety, fatigue, in a dream like state with an endless stare was incredible. He hit it on the head. I didn't think anyone one could recreate that but he nailed it. Incredible acting.|, Five years later, I think this is still Joaquin's best film so far. Absolutely blew me away! Joaquin is a national treasure.|, Joaquin Phoenix....

He is just always an actor, that is  interesting to watch... no matter what the film..|, Joaquin Phoenix is probably the PERFECT actor.

I have never felt ""oh gawd, how lame or mediocre"" watching any of his performances. He seems to have no ego. I don't have the words to explain adequately just how good he is.

He nails it here. Again.|, This film was released a few months ago in Europe, and let me just say it was easily the best film I saw last year. The trailer implies there’s more action than there actually is, but it’s a beautiful, violent poem of a film.

And it’s short. In a world filled with overstuffed 3 hour action movies, finally something that gets to the point.|, i think this movie touched me more than the joker. The funeral scene... i don't recall crying that hard ever during a movie.|, just watched it yesterday, and it really blew me away. the soundtrack, plot and acting is nothing like i've ever seen. i had chills throughout the entire movie. this is by far joaquin's best film, next to beau is afraid, joker and her.|, This film makes you question every scene. Nothing is delivered directly to the viewer. You will find yourself wondering what is real or simply imagined. When the film ends you sit in your chair and piece the experience together as best you can. Brilliant style of directing in my opinion. Of course Joaquin Phoenix takes the main stage, as his role suits him perfectly as a dramatic actor.|, One of those films that blows your mind and is even better the 2nd time you watch it.|, I've watched this 3 yrs ago. All I can say is that this movie for me is quite brutal even with the brutal scenes not being shown in the camera. I did remember reading that the director really cut out the brutal scenes from this movie especially the killing part and still feel the brutality from it."
You Won't Be Alone,YOU WON&#39;T BE ALONE - Official Trailer [HD] - Only in Theaters April 1,6-G39n2sCVU,2569708,7267,458,"I watched it today. And I gotta say that this movie moved me deeply. Don’t go in expecting a jump-scare kinda horror film. It’s more of a drama with horror and folklore elements. Such a deep film. One of my favourites I’ve seen in the recent times!|, This was such a BEAUTIFUL movie. The poetry, the story, the lines. Totally worth a watch.|, It’s a beautiful film, just don’t go in expecting horror. It’s more of a drama and a meditation on what it means to be human. It is also presented in an “art house” style that can be frustrating to some viewers. As someone who appreciates and admires great cinematography I loved it 😍|, Um lindo filme, lindo, lindo, LINDO. Estava esperando algo baseado no elemento terror, que é o que o filme passa num primeiro momento, mas conforme você assiste, a emoção toma conta de você. A experiência é baseada no que é ser um humano, em diferentes perspectivas, já que ela é uma bruxa que toma peles, e as vive baseadas em sua própria experiência de mundo. O filme é perspicaz, inteligente, emocionante. Uma obra prima!|, I first watched this film last year and I shit you not... I immediately restarted it and watched it again. Then I watched it again the next day. It's a MASTERPIECE!!!|, Македонски производ... секоја чест... треба повеќе вакви филмови од Македонија👌🇲🇰🇲🇰🇲🇰|, This movie is breathtaking. Honestly, one of the most beautiful works of art I’ve ever seen. I can’t recommend this enough.|, Astounding film. I went in feeling intrigued and walked out in a trance. Same feeling I got after seeing Terrence Malick’s The New World for the first time.|, This is a fantastic film, I wouldn't call it ""art house"" but the way it is told is incredibly thought-provoking.|, How does this film not have a physical release?! One of the most gorgeous films from 2022. Should have been nominated for a Cinematography Oscar. Yet it's only got a DVD release in Australia? We need a 4K!!! Or a blu-ray at least."
You're Next,You&#39;re Next Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Horror Movie HD,ufUQWpEkbf0,6210151,23620,4470,"I was expecting the movie to be so much diffrent than it was from this trailer but it was 10x better than I expected.. Great storyline great plot good kills good twists !!! LOVED IT|, I watched this movie and.. to be honest I’ve never watched something that good. The end isn’t expected at all... this is so amazingly written! I would recommend this horror film to everyone!!! I showed it to a lot of friends of mine, and.. I swear they loved it so much|, That Erin chick kicked major ass. She really put up a good fight. If I were in her position I probably would've shit my pants and died within 20 minutes of the movie. Props to her.|, *ATTENTION!*
This movie is really good, and if you're looking for a great horror movie, this is the one to watch. It's an amazing movie with an outstanding plot twist at the end. =)|, This is probably the best movie trailer ever made. The music choice and editing is just plain brilliant.|, I love it.. No complaints.. Even though it was very serious there was a good few one liners, which made it more real, I could see siblings bitching about things the way these did even in a time like that.. I loved that when she killed someone she made sure they didn't get back up like most people do when they're killing someone.. First film I've watched in a while were I do not have one complaint..|, Since the victims are not stupid drunk party teenagers I think I am going to watch it.|, Absolutely incredible movie. Many people won't understand why it's great and take it as being 'cheesy'. But horror enthusiasts will appreciate its effort to recreate the terror and fun that was to be had in the late 70s and 80s for the horror genre.|, Finally! Like am I the only one who was actually happy that Hollywood finally made a realistic horror movie? Like come on! All the other ones just have girls screaming and running, but this one has a girl who actually fights back! Like everyone fights back, but in other horror movies, it's just run run run.|, I love how this movie went from classic slasher to full dark comedy halfway through. Such a brilliant film."

I took care of many people suffering from ALS and this movie really does nail it on the head. The emotions, the hurt, feeling invisible- a terrible disease which takes away your body yet leaves your mind to suffer. Swank played an amazing role in this film and portrayed what the true nature of the disease does.|, I have no words. This film was beautiful in every way. Both actresses gave performances that you simply rarely see these days. It is acting at its finest and most true. Emmy Rossum... you stole my heart. This film is not over the top or pushing too hard... it simply IS and that simplicity makes you FEEL. Thankful for films that still aim to make us see the every day life... not all the glitz and the glam.. but the every day life... the every day hardships and trials we all face. No matter where you are at in life... this film will move you.|, Loved this movie so much! Both incredible actresses and I was choking back the tears so many times throughout.|, The idea of the movie is to show how a life can change for you if you got serious dissase. I dont care if its remake or not, i saw this movie and it opened my eyes about what people are going through in this moments and also to respect more my life and body. Beautiful movie, Thank you|, The greatest gift of my life was holding my mother in my arms when she passed away from brain cancer. This is a truly remarkable movie which did a fabulous job of depicting the absolute pettiness and self centeredness of family and the true love and friendship of strangers. Both Hilary Swank and Emmy Rossum did Oscar winning performances in this film.|, Not too many movies make me cry, but I had tears in my eyes at the end of this movie. Very powerful. Emmy and Hilary were perfect for their roles. One of my favorite movies ever ❤️|, I came here for Emmy Rossum, and fell in love with Hilary Swank! Beautiful and touching film. Both actresses convey everything so genuinely ❤️|, My mother in law just passed away a month ago from this illness, I cried the whole trailer|, Just watched this movie. And I've watched a lot of your stereotypical sad tear - jerker movies, but none had managed to actually break me like this. First time I've actually cried watching a movie!
So shocked to see IMBD and rotten tomato reviews. I'd without a doubt give it 5*'s!! Beautiful"

The Dark Side of Dimensions Official US Trailer 1 (2017 Movie) [HD],L5hx5rvLUN8,1373713,13293,2271,"It’s honestly a shame they didn’t use this plot to continue a new YuGiOh series with the original cast.|, You guys probably dont know how much I cried bc of this reboot.
Watching this feels like my childhood finally returned to me.
15 years of being Yugi's fan :) Im now 24 and I still love Yugi and his gang so much :)|, I'm glad they're finally making their comeback. My childhood is coming back. First Dragon Ball, now the CLASSIC Yu-gi-oh. Life has never been better|, Two weeks before this trailer was released I finished watching Duel Monsters and felt very bad. I loved Yu-Gi-Oh since I was 3 years old (2002) and the ending of DM felt unfinished and rushed. Two days after I saw the ending of DM our college teacher said that everyone should write a wish on a piece of paper and give it to her so she could make a tree with these pieces of paper as its leaves. I was still crying about the bad ending of DM and wished to find something, just SOMETHING, just one episode that I might have missed, where Yugi could properly say goodbye to Atem. Two weeks after that this trailer was released. No one believes me but I think that my wish had come true. Thank you, all the people who created this movie, from this 3 years old Russian girl that I was back when I saw Yu-Gi-Oh first, from 17 years old me who had her wish granted and from today's 21 years old me who will love Yu-Gi-Oh until the end|, I love how the blue eyes white dragon is actually a blue eyes white dragon|, Finally, a movie featuring my favourite old characters in modern day. I am so happy this is still kicking so much later into my life.|, I am a huge fan of YUGIOH! And I am so happy they are making a 20th anniversary movie to celebrate the classic YUGIOH! Please put this movie in movie theaters and translated to English!! :) <3|, I really like that this is set after the manga. Atem has moved on, and now Yugi has a chance to shine. I always thought it was unfair for him, that Atem got all of the dueling glory. Yugi's brilliance was shown as early on as his/their Duel with Pegasus. If he wasn't as good as Atem, then his moves never would have saved the day. With all of the advents in dueling every since the original aired, however, I wonder how thrilling the duels can be. It seems, by the trailer, that Kaiba is using Azure Eyes, which is a synchro monster. Unless Yugi altered the timeline after seeing Yuusei's Synchro monsters, this would place this movie outside of canon continuity. Or, it could place the sequel series in a continuity of their own. That might not be a bad thing, however. I have a Ghostrick deck on Legacy of the Duelist that totally owns the first series. They could use a bit more speed to he[p the pacing of the story as well as bring the classic characters to a new generation of duelists. What could Atem have done with XYZ monsters, or Pendulums? Alas, only the fanfiction authors can tell us that :)|, A perfect way to celebrate the 20th anniversary of one of the most greatest Tcg series of all time and hopefully a beautiful finale and book end to the original series itself|, What an incredible series this show took me from a couch bomb and transform me into a computer animator this show really sparked a point in my evolution thank you"

Just focusing on humans interacting? We really need more of these movies.|, I'm really looking forward to this film! It does have that ex_machina feel to it! Just three characters interacting. Movie looks very suspenseful! Be glad to see if Margret Robbies acting ability really shows in this film and Chris pine has potential to be a amazing actor and this role he's playing could show his true talent while Chiwetel is already going to be awesome! The cinematography looks amazing and even though this is a love triangle movie, it still has this dark unsettling tone to it, which I love!! |, This was one of 3 books I was able to read cover to cover on my own in school. One of the only books to ever keep me on the edge. Very happy to see a movie had been made.|, Unconventional, very different and realistic take on postapocalyptic world. It is not some calculated psycho thriller like trailer made it, it is a character study drama and a good one. Cast is having great chemistry, everyone is developed well so you understand their decisions when it comes to tricky parts. It has intimate atmosphere and is very captivating at moments when tough choices are made. It is little bit slow, but beautifully photographed and realized. 3.5/5|, no matter what people say and regardless of the book I still want to see the movie for myself.|, I remember this book from 4th grade. Still one of the best books I have read. |, It looks really good looking forward to seeing this.|, Imagine being the only girl alive living with Chris Pine and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Good lord|, I never realised Margot Robbie was actually a good actress when I used to watch her in Neighbours. But she's been in so many great movies lately, and her acting is really good. I mean that accent is great!|, For any of you wondering in the movie the characters are in Anne, loomis and Caleb now in the movie it is a love triangle to sum it all up but in the book there was nuclear apocalypse (as well)and the characters are Anne and Loomis now in the book it focuses on surviving because Loomis turns out to be a tyrant and Anne is trying to escape from him but in the movie it's a love triangle (and caleb wasn't in the book at all)so its pretty diffrent"

Amazing film! |, This is, simply put, one of the most intense films i have ever had the great fortune of watching. And the trailer, is equally as intense.|, That cover of 'Nothing Else Matters' is amazing. Combined with the stealth helos approaching...gives me chills.
|, Great movie. The climax with the raid on the compound was really tense, even though you pretty much know how it ends. Very well done movie.|, A great movie, one of the greatest of the last 15 years. Not about the war, or the track of Bin Laden, but about a woman's obsession.|, I'm not gonna get into whether or not this is an accurate depiction of what happened...... But this is still one of my favorite trailers of all time!|, I can't say enough how kick ass this movie was. ZDT is definitely my favorite war movie after seeing it. It has an interesting story, action, and likeable characters especially Maya since her personality has sass. This movie is a must see if you truly are American.|, Jessica Chastain should've won the Oscar for Best Actress..|, One of the best movies ever, by one of the best directors working today.  3 hours have never gone by so fast in a movie theatre before or since.|, ""Nothing Else Matters"" lyrics fit so perfectly with this story, and the Scaly & Kolacny Brothers cover is bone chilling."

And this is a comedy movie that is actually FUNNY. In a natural and clever way. Really enjoyed it|, I can’t believe they all ended up being Oscar winners/nominees like that’s GROWTH|, I've read the movie's reviews and I was a little disappointed they were mixed or average but I decided to watch it anyway as a final farewell to the great first movie, and let me tell you I was not  really disappointed not even close.  I absolutely loved everything about the movie, how they brought the old cast back, the new cast, the story, the music, the action sequences, the ending, just frigging everything, that's a great movie right here don't let the reviews tell you otherwise|, I cannot express how grateful I am that they got the original cast all back for this.|, Finally a movie after ten years that actually worth my money again|, *It's not officially Zombieland if there are no twinkies.*|, Just watched this and I absolutely loved it.
